<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter
                    A/S I Likvidation (formerly known as Knud E Hansen A/S)(“DSK”)
                    took out this Originating Summons No 807 of 2009 (“OS 807”)
                    to obtain leave under s 29 of the International Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)(“IAA”) to enforce a final award made
                    by the Danish Arbitration Institute (“the Tribunal”) on
                    16 April 2009 against the defendant, Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd
                    (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments Ltd)
                    (“Ultrapolis”). In the arbitration before the Tribunal, DSK was
                    the claimant and Ultrapolis was the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       DSK is a Danish company specialising in
                    providing consultant services for ship design. Ultrapolis engaged DSK to provide
                    professional design services for a 90m mega yacht by entering into a written
                    agreement dated 29 August 2005 (“First Agreement”). Enclosed
                    in the First Agreement was DSK’s Standard Conditions of Sale, Work and
                    Delivery (July 2001 version) which Ultrapolis signed on all pages of the printed
                    standard conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Thereafter, the parties mutually rescinded the
                    First Agreement in favour of a new agreement for design services for a 100m mega
                    yacht (“New Agreement”). It is not in dispute that both parties
                    signed the New Agreement. Counsel for DSK, Mr Herman Jeremiah, informed the
                    court that the contract was concluded on 21 December 2005. I interpose here
                    to mention that a preliminary issue in dispute before the Tribunal was whether
                    the November 2005 version of the Standard Conditions of Sale, Work and Delivery
                    (“the Standard Conditions”), which included the arbitration
                    clause, formed part of the New Agreement. It is an issue that has surfaced as a
                    ground in opposition to OS 807.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       DSK said it completed and delivered 95% of the
                    contracted work to Ultrapolis. DSK duly claimed for 95% of the remuneration but
                    Ultrapolis refused to pay. DSK then referred the matter to arbitration before
                    three members of the Tribunal on 24 November 2006, namely Professor Vibe
                    Ulfbeck(chairman), Attorney Peter Bang and Attorney Lars M. Hareskov.
                    Ultrapolis challenged the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the ground that there
                    was no agreement to arbitrate as the New Agreement did not incorporate the
                    arbitration clause in the Standard Conditions. After a contested hearing on the
                    preliminary issue of jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to
                    hear the dispute having found that the Standard Conditions, including the
                    arbitration clause, formed part of the New Agreement, and that the wording of
                    the arbitration clause clearly referred to the Tribunal, the Danish Arbitration
                    Institute. Ultrapolis did not challenge the Tribunal’s decision on
                    jurisdiction in the Danish Court (as it was entitled to do). Ultrapolis also
                    chose to be absent from the main oral hearing of the substantive dispute before
                    the Tribunal which took place on 5 December 2008. The Tribunal then passed its
                    award on 11 February 2009 (“First Award”) and subsequently, a
                    corrected award on 16 April 2009 (“Corrected Award”). The
                    explanation for the Corrected Award is found in <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OS 807</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       DSK is applying for leave to enforce the
                    Corrected Award (it being the final award of the Tribunal) under s 29 of
                    the IAA. Such an application is usually made <em>ex-parte</em>, but on this occasion, DSK asked for OS 807 to be fixed
                    for hearing on an <em>inter partes</em> basis. The Duty
                    Registrar acceded to DSK’s request on 15 July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Ultrapolis is resisting the enforcement of the
                    Corrected Award on the grounds that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     DSK is not able to produce the
                        original arbitration agreement and the copy that has been produced does not
                        constitute an arbitration agreement as required under s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     the award which DSK seeks to enforce is founded on a
                        non-existent arbitration agreement and so enforcement should be refused
                        under s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    IAA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     if there was an
                        arbitration agreement as claimed by DSK, the composition of the arbitral
                        authority was not in accordance with it and, therefore, enforcement of the
                        Corrected Award should be refused under s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Corrected Award was made and passed at a time when the
                        Tribunal was <em>functus officio</em> with the
                        consequence that the enforcement of the Corrected Award should be refused
                        under s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the
                    IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before I consider each of the objections (which
                    are, for expediency, formulated as issues) in turn, I should mention the case
                    advanced by Ultrapolis was initially limited to issues (a), (c) and (d). Issue
                    (b) was introduced in the course of argument and that necessitated an
                    adjournment for further affidavits to be filed by experts on Danish
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues opposing enforcement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First issue: whether DSK has satisfied s 30(1)(b) of the IAA to
                produce a certified true copy of the arbitration agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA requires the production of the “original
                    arbitration agreement” under which the award purports to have been made.
                    The provision reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30. —(1)  In any proceedings in which a person seeks to
                        enforce a foreign award by virtue of this Part, he shall produce to the
                        court —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)  the original arbitration agreement under which the award
                        purports to have been made, or a duly certified copy thereof;
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The manner of complying with the statutory
                    provision is prescribed by O 69A r 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) which requires the applicant to exhibit
                    the arbitration agreement, among other documents, in an affidavit. Order 69A
                        r 6(<em>a</em>) of the ROC also allows for
                    production of duly certified copies of the relevant documents. The affidavit in
                    support of OS 807 was deposed by DSK’s Danish lawyer, Mr Carsten
                    Pedersen. Mr Pedersen had the conduct of the Danish arbitration on behalf
                    of DSK. In his affidavit, he exhibited a copy of the New Agreement that was
                    executed by the parties and a certified true copy of the Standard Conditions. I
                    must mention at the outset that the dispute was not with the propriety of the
                    certification of the Standard Conditions. The dispute centred on the absence of
                    an “arbitration agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I start with the New Agreement. It is common
                    ground that the New Agreement was entered into between the parties. Counsel for
                    Ultrapolis, Mr Sarbit Singh, in the course of argument, accepted that DSK
                    would not have the original of the signed New Agreement as the original signed
                    copy was couriered by DSK to Ultrapolis and its whereabouts thereafter is
                    unclear. The copy of the New Agreement exhibited in Mr Pedersen’s
                    affidavit is affirmed to be a true a copy of the original signed New Agreement.
                    On at least three occasions, Ultrapolis had admitted that the copy of the signed
                    New Agreement is a true copy of the original signed New Agreement,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Christopher Bridges, a
                        Singapore advocate and solicitor, who previously represented Ultrapolis had
                        confirmed in a letter dated 16 January 2007 to the Tribunal that the
                        copy of the signed New Agreement produced by DSK was a true
                    copy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Managing
                        Director of Ultrapolis, Mr Rinaldo Romani, had confirmed to the
                        Tribunal that he had signed the New Agreement produced by DSK when giving
                        evidence at the preliminary hearing on 18 January 2008;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     In written
                        submissions tendered on behalf of Ultrapolis to the High Court on
                        12 June 2009 in relation to Summons No 1654 of 2009/S filed in
                        Suit No 300 of 2008, Mr Singh’s firm, M/s Lim &amp; Lim,
                        confirmed that the copy of the New Agreement produced by DSK was duly
                        executed by Ultrapolis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The real issue before me is whether the
                    Standard Conditions which contained the arbitration clause formed part of the
                    New Agreement. This issue is considered in two contexts: (a) the first stage of
                    enforcement under s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, and
                    (b) the second stage is the refusal of enforcement under s 31(2) of the
                    IAA. For now, the discussions concern the first stage of enforcement under
                        s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Section 27(1) of the IAA defines an
                    “arbitration agreement” as an agreement in writing of the kind
                    referred to in Article II.1 of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
                    of Foreign Arbitral Awards concluded at New York on 10 June 1958
                    (“New York Convention”). An “agreement in writing”
                    includes an agreement contained in an exchange of letters, telegrams,
                    telefacsimile or in a communication by teleprinter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present case, the existence of an
                    arbitration agreement in writing is disputed. Ultrapolis argues that the
                    arbitration clause in the Standard Conditions did not form part of the New
                    Agreement because Ultrapolis executed the New Agreement without signing the
                    Standard Conditions. The omission is significant, so the argument develops,
                    because in the case of the First Agreement, Ultrapolis had signed on all pages
                    of the Standard Conditions of Sale, Work and Delivery (July 2001 version) to
                    signify its acceptance of the printed standard conditions as forming part of the
                    First Agreement. As such, in the absence of a duly signed copy of the Standard
                    Conditions, there was no agreement to arbitrate disputes arising in connection
                    with the New Agreement. In addition, Mr Singh submits that cl 13 of
                    the New Agreement was not deleted by an oversight, and further points out that
                    the Standard Conditions were not enclosed together with the signed original copy
                    of the New Agreement. In any case, Mr Singh argues that cl 13 in
                    itself is insufficient in law to incorporate the arbitration clause in the
                    Standard Conditions. Clause 13 of the New Agreement reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The clauses of this contract prevail on the enclosed standard conditions
                        that are applicable only if the matters are not regulated between the
                        Parties by this contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Putting Mr Singh’s argument in
                    perspective, the question is whether at the first stage of enforcement the court
                    has to determine if the arbitration clause in the Standard Conditions formed
                    part of the New Agreement <em>before</em> it can be
                    satisfied that an arbitration agreement has been produced, as required by
                        s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and O 69A
                        r 6(<em>a</em>) of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>Aloe Vera of America,
                        Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 174
                        (“<em>Aloe Vera</em>”) the plaintiff had
                    entered into an agreement with the first defendant ("the Agreement"). The second
                    defendant, Chiew Chee Boon (“Mr Chiew”), had signed the
                    Agreement on the first defendant's behalf as its manager, but was not expressly
                    stated to be a contracting party to the Agreement. The Agreement provided for
                    disputes between the parties to be mediated, and if mediation was unsuccessful,
                    to be arbitrated in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
                    Association. The Agreement provided for the law of Arizona, USA to be the
                    governing law. Following the termination of the Agreement, the plaintiff
                    commenced arbitration proceedings and obtained a Final Arbitration Award against
                    both the first defendant and Mr Chiew ("the Award"). The plaintiff
                    successfully took out an originating summons, on an ex parte basis, to obtain
                    leave to enforce the Award against the defendants in Singapore. Mr Chiew
                    applied to set aside the order granting leave, but this was dismissed by an
                    Assistant Registrar. Mr Chiew then appealed against the Assistant
                    Registrar's decision. His grounds for setting aside the order granting leave
                    were that the plaintiff had not crossed the preliminary hurdle of establishing
                    that there was an arbitration agreement between the parties. It was also argued
                    that the question whether an arbitration agreement existed had to be decided on
                    the basis of Singapore law. Alternatively, enforcement should have been refused
                    because Mr Chiew was able to satisfy one or more of the grounds set out in
                    s 31(2) and/or s 31(4) of the IAA.</p>

                    adopted a mechanistic approach to the first stage of enforcement. At
                    para [27], Prakash J held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This case [a Norwegian case, a decision of the Hålogaland Court of Appeal
                        in August 1999 reported at Yearbook Comm Arb'n XXVII (2002) p 519 ("the
                        Hålogaland case")] was used by [counsel for Mr Chiew] to substantiate
                        the proposition that whether an arbitration agreement existed had to be
                        decided on the basis of Singapore law. This reliance does not, however, take
                        him very far. The court in the Hålogaland case held that "the contents of
                        the E-mails appear obscure and incomplete and reflect just fragments of an
                        agreement". Obviously, these documents did not even satisfy the formalities
                        for the enforcement of an award as they did not constitute an arbitration
                        agreement in writing as required by Arts II and IV of the Convention.
                            <em>The Singapore court too would look at the document
                            produced as the arbitration agreement under which the award had been
                            made and consider whether under our law such document is capable of
                            constituting an arbitration agreement. This would be a fairly
                            formalistic examination as stated in</em> [39] <em>below</em>. Applying the Hålogaland case would not require me to
                        undertake a re-examination of the Arbitrator's decision on its merits.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Praskash J declined to follow the
                    appellate decision of the US Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit in the
                    Sarhank Group v Oracle Corporation 404 F 3d 657 (2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Cir, 2005)("the Sarhank case") where the court held it was American federal
                    arbitration law that controlled the issue [of whether the parties had agreed to
                    submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrators] and "an American
                    nonsignatory [could] not be bound to arbitrate in the absence of a full showing
                    of facts supporting an articulable theory based on American contract law or
                    American agency law". In rejecting the approach of the US Court of Appeal in the
                    Sarhank case (at [38]), Prakash J reasoned:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The approach taken by the appellate court was antithetical to that
                        enshrined in the Convention. It demonstrated an insular attitude to the
                        decisions of foreign tribunals involving American nationals without regard
                        to the fact that the American parties had chosen to do business in a foreign
                        jurisdiction and to make their agreements subject to foreign law and foreign
                        arbitration. It runs counter to international comity and is an attitude
                        that, if followed widely in the US, would adversely affect the enforcement
                        of US arbitration awards abroad since the Convention implements a system
                        that enjoins mutuality and reciprocity so that there is a danger of non-US
                        jurisdictions refusing to enforce US awards when their own awards are not
                        recognised in the US.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Dardana Ltd v Yukos Oil
                        Co</em> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 326 ("<em>Dardana</em> "), Mance LJ was of the view that all that was
                    required at the first stage was the production of a record of an arbitration
                    agreement made in writing with (allegedly) the authority of the parties to it.
                    Mance LJ (at [9]) rejected counsel’s argument that the English
                    equivalent of O69A r 6 could be used to resist the enforcement of the award
                    on the grounds that it would lead to a curious duplication and inconsistency in
                    onus. Mance LJ held at [10] and [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I consider that the scheme of the Act is reasonably clear. A successful
                        party to a New York Convention award, as defined in s. 100(1) [of the
                        Arbitration Act 1996] has a prima facie right to recognition and
                        enforcement. <em>At the first stage, a party seeking
                            recognition or enforcement must, under s.102 (1) produce the duly
                            authenticated award or a duly certified copy and the original
                            arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy. … Once such
                            documents have been produced, recognition or enforcement may be refused
                            at the second stage only if the other party proves that the situation
                            falls within one of the heads set out in s 103(2)</em> [of
                        the Arbitration Act 1996].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One cannot produce an agreement made otherwise than in writing. However,
                        one can produce terms in writing, containing an arbitration clause, by
                        reference to which agreement was (allegedly) reached, and one can produce a
                        record of an arbitration agreement made in writing with (allegedly) the
                        authority of the parties to it. That, it seems to me, is all that is
                        probably therefore required at the first stage. That conclusion supports,
                        rather than undermines the further conclusion that, <em>at
                            the first stage, all that is required by way of an arbitration agreement
                            is apparently valid documentation, containing an arbitration clause, by
                            reference to which the arbitrators have accepted that the parties had
                            agreed on arbitration or in which the arbitrators have accepted that an
                            agreement to arbitrate was recorded with the parties’ authority.
                            On that basis, it is at the second stage, under s. 103(2)</em> [of
                        the Arbitration Act 1996]<em>, that the other party has to
                            prove that no such agreement was ever made or validly
                        made</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Citing Mann LJ at [10] and [12] of
                        <em>Dardana</em>, Prakash J came to the conclusion
                    that the examination that the court must make of the documents under O 69A
                    r 6 is a formalistic one and not a substantive one (at [42]). The court
                    held (at [41]) that there was a contract between Asianic and Aloe Vera of
                    America, Inc that contained an arbitration clause. Prakash J further
                    referred to Robert Merkin, <em>Arbitration Law</em> (LLP,
                    1991) (Service Issue No 42: 5 December 2005) at para 19.48 which
                    stated “This wording [of s 101(3) of the English Act 1996] makes it
                    clear that the enforcement process is a mechanistic one, and that the court may
                    simply give a judgment which implements the award itself” for the
                    proposition that the idea that the enforcement process is a mechanistic one
                    which does not require judicial investigation by the court of the jurisdiction
                    in which enforcement is sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On Mance LJ’s view that the dispute
                    as to the arbitration agreement should be dealt with at the second stage of
                    enforcement, Prakash J is of a same view when she stated (at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…I do not think that it is correct for a court that is asked to
                        enforce an award under the Convention to go behind the holding on the merits
                        on this aspect that has been made by the Arbitrator except to the extent
                        that this is permitted by the Convention grounds during the second stage of
                        the enforcement process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Further (at [56]), Prakash J stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…He [Mr Chiew] may be able to resist enforcement here if he
                        can establish that the arbitration agreement was "not valid under the law to
                        which the parties have subjected it" within the meaning of that phrase in
                            s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) [of the IAA]. He is not,
                        however, entitled to object to the initial grant of leave to enforce on the
                        basis that the Arbitrator erred in holding that he was a party to the
                        arbitration. As the enforcement court, I can only permit Mr Chiew to
                        resist enforcement if he is able to establish one of the grounds set out in
                        s 31(2) of the Act [IAA]. Except to the extent permitted by those
                        grounds, I cannot look into the merits of the Award and allow Mr Chiew
                        to re-litigate issues that he could have brought up either before the
                        Arbitrator or the supervisory court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I accept the basis of the mechanistic approach
                    at the first stage of enforcement as reasoned by Prakash J in <em>Aloe Vera</em>. Applying <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em> and for the following reasons here, I am persuaded that DSK
                    has satisfied s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA having
                    produced a copy of the New Agreement and a certified true copy of the Standard
                    Conditions. <em>Firstly</em>, s 30(2) of the IAA
                    provides that a document produced to a court in accordance with this section
                    shall, upon mere production, be received by the court as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the matters to which it relates. On the
                    present facts, cl 13 of the New Agreement provides that the Standard
                    Conditions are applicable so long as they are not inconsistent with the clauses
                    in the New Agreement. The last page of the New Agreement carried the signature
                    of Finn Wollese, Managing Director of DSK, and the signature of Yap Soon Kiat, a
                    director of Ultrapolis. Below the signature of Mr Yap were the following
                    typed written words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Encl:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-Standard Conditions of Sale, Work and Delivery [<em>i.e</em>., the Standard Conditions]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-Appendix A Scope of Work</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although factually the Standard Conditions
                    were not enclosed with the signed original copy of the New Agreement, it is
                    common ground that a copy of the Standard Conditions together with the draft New
                    Agreement and Appendix A were <em>earlier</em> emailed on
                    2 December 2005 to Mr Romani. Mr Romani in his affidavit of
                    7 September 2009 also referred to this email and the same attachments.
                    Mr Pedersen in his affidavit of 10 July 2009 filed in support of OS
                    807 produced a certified true copy of the Standard Conditions. This certified
                    true copy and the Standard Conditions emailed to Mr Romani on
                    2 December 2005 are of the same printed version. The same Standard
                    Conditions were raised, argued and decided by the Tribunal on the preliminary
                    question concerning the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Mr Pedersen has
                    produced in OS 807, the New Agreement and the certified true copy of the
                    Standard Conditions (in particular cl 13 of the New Agreement and
                    cl 19 of the Standard Conditions) as the arbitration clause under which the
                    Corrected Award had been made. For purposes of s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, all the applicant needs to produce is the
                    arbitration agreement under which the award “<em>purports
                        to have been made</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     
          <em>Secondly</em>, an
                    agreement in writing within the meaning of s 27(1) of the IAA together with
                    Article II.2 of the New York Convention is not limited to a document between the
                    parties that had been signed by the parties as such. As a reminder,
                    Mr Singh has stressed in argument that the certified true copy of the
                    Standard Conditions was not initialled by Ultrapolis to signify acceptance of
                    the printed standard conditions including the arbitration clause. Prakash J
                    in the <em>Aloe Vera</em> quoted the Court of Appeal of
                    Manitoba, Canada, in the case of <em>Proctor v
                        Schellenberg</em> [2003] 2 WWR 621 where Hamilton JA
                    stated at [18] that “[w]hat is important is that there be a record to
                    evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by an arbitral
                    process”. Agreeing with the attitude taken by the Court of Appeal of
                    Manitoba in the above judgment and adopting the view that one must take a
                    pragmatic approach towards the definitions in the New York Convention and the
                    IAA in order to give effect to arbitral awards granted outside Singapore,
                    Prakash J held at [17] that Article II.1 of the New York Convention
                    required a written agreement but it did not require a signature. As to Article
                    II.2 of the New York Convention, it was an illustrative and inclusive clause and
                    not an exhaustive list of what constituted an agreement in writing.
                    Prakash J held that it was more difficult to argue in the context of this
                    definition that an arbitration agreement only existed when there was a signed
                    document between the parties. Applying <em>Aloe Vera</em>,
                    the fact that the Standard Conditions were not signed does not mean that there
                    was no arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In conclusion, for the reasons stated above,
                    DSK satisfied s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA by
                    producing a certified true copy of the Standard Conditions which included the
                    arbitration clause as constituting the agreement to arbitrate disputes in
                    connection with the New Agreement. In short, it was the arbitration agreement
                    under which the Corrected Award “purports to have been
                    made.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second issue: whether there was an arbitration agreement between the
                parties under s 31(2)(b) of the IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As I have alluded to in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> and <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                    above, the challenge to the existence of the arbitration agreement should be
                    dealt with under s 31(2) of the IAA rather than at stage 1 (see also
                    Mance LJ in <em>Dardana</em> at [10]) and [12]). In
                    opposing enforceability, Ultrapolis is first and foremost relying on
                        s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA. Mr Singh
                    argues that the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Dallah
                        Real Estate and Tourism Holding Co v The Ministry of Religious Affairs,
                        Government of Pakistan</em> [2009] EWCA Civ 755
                        (“<em>Dallah Estate</em>”) and <em>Aloe Vera</em> are inconsistent decisions and Mr Singh
                    urges me to follow <em>Dallah Estate</em>.
                    Mr Singh’s contention is wrong for three reasons. First, <em>Dallah Estate</em> does not deal with the first stage of
                    enforcement, and Mr Jeremiah is correct on this point. There, therefore, is
                    no conflict between <em>Dallah Estate</em> and <em>Aloe Vera</em> in relation to Prakash J’s holding in
                        <em>Aloe Vera</em> that the examination that the court
                    must make of the documents under O 69A r 6(1)(<em>a</em>) is a formalistic one and not a substantive one (at [41] &amp;
                    [42] of the report). Second, Mr Singh seemingly drew support for his
                    arguments on s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) from passages in
                        <em>Aloe Vera</em> that relate to the first stage of
                    enforcement, and that is clearly a misapplication of the ratio of the decision.
                    Third, in relation to the second stage of enforcement based on the grounds for
                    refusal to enforce an award, <em>Aloe Vera</em> may be read
                    consistently with <em>Dallah Estate</em>. Before dealing
                    with the second issue, it is necessary to first examine the two
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Dallah
                    Estate</em>, Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding Company
                    (“Dallah”), a Saudi Arabian company, was engaged in the provision
                    of services to Muslims who performed Hajj at Mecca. In December 1994, the
                    Pakistani cabinet approved in principle a proposal to establish the
                    “Awami Hajj Trust” for the purpose of mobilising savings from
                    intending Hajj pilgrims and for the investment of those savings in
                    Sharia-approved schemes. The trust came into existence on 14 February 1996
                    and ceased to exist on 12 December 1996. Negotiations between Dallah and
                    the Government of Pakistan (“GoP”) continued well into 1996
                    culminating in an agreement dated 10 September 1996 which was expressed to
                    be made between Dallah and the Trust. It contained an arbitration clause. The
                    GoP was not expressed to be a party to the agreement, nor did it sign it in any
                    capacity. Subsequently, there was a change of government in Pakistan and the
                    relationship between the GoP, the Trust and Dallah broke down so much so that
                    the Ministry of Religious Affairs (“MORA”) wrote to Dallah
                    accusing it of having repudiated the agreement and stated that the agreement was
                    therefore discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 19 May 1998, Dallah purported to
                    commence arbitration against the MORA under the rules of the ICC claiming
                    damages for breach of the agreement. On 16 September 1998, the ICC
                    appointed an arbitrator for the GoP because it had not nominated one, and the
                    MORA denied that it was a party to the arbitration. On 26 June 2001, the
                    tribunal rendered a first partial award in Paris, dealing solely with
                    jurisdiction. The tribunal held that the MORA was bound by the arbitration
                    clause in the agreement, and that the dispute fell within the terms of the
                    arbitration clause. In the final award rendered on 23 June 2006 in Paris,
                    the tribunal ordered the GoP to pay Dallah US$18,907,603 by way of damages for
                    breach of the agreement, plus costs and fees, a total of
                US$20,588,040.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 9 October 2006, Christopher
                    Clarke J made an order under s 101(2) of the English Arbitration Act
                    1996 (“English Act 1996”), on a without notice application, giving
                    Dallah permission to enforce the final award in the same manner as a judgment of
                    the court. On 28 March 2008, the GoP applied to set aside the order, arguing
                    that the court should refuse enforcement on the basis that there was no valid
                    arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 103(2)(<em>b</em>) of the English Act 1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At first instance, Aikens J set aside the
                    order made by Christopher Clarke J. Aikens J held that under
                        s 103(2)(<em>b</em>) of the English Act 1996, the
                    proceedings were to take the form of a full rehearing. Applying French law as
                    the law of the country where the award was made, it was not the subjective
                    intention of all the parties that the GoP should be bound by the agreement or
                    the arbitration clause. Accordingly, the GoP had satisfied the burden of
                    proving, for the purposes of s 103(2)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the English Act 1996, that the arbitration agreement in clause 23 was
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On appeal to the Court of Appeal, one issue
                    raised was whether in circumstances where the issue was the same as that which
                    had been before the tribunal, proceedings under s 103(2) of the English Act
                    1996 should take the form of a full rehearing or a more limited review. Miss
                    Hilary Heilbron QC for Dallah submitted that the court when considering a
                    challenge to the enforcement of a foreign arbitration award under
                        s 103(2)(<em>b</em>) of the English Act 1996
                    should not conduct a full trial of the issues of fact and law to which the
                    application gave rise, but should limit itself to an enquiry more in the nature
                    of a review, accepting any relevant findings of fact and decisions of the
                    tribunal unless they could be shown to be clearly wrong. Moore Bick LJ
                    rejected Miss Heilbron’s submission that there should be a limited review
                    on the ground that the language of Article V.1 of the New York Convention
                    itself, which required the party against whom enforcement was sought to furnish
                    proof of the matters to which it referred (an expression accurately reflected in
                    the more modern language of s 103(2) of the English Act 1996 which states
                    that “Recognition or enforcement of the award may be refused if the
                    person against whom it is invoked proves…”). Moore Bick LJ
                    found it very difficult to interpret the expression “furnish
                    proof” as meaning anything other than requiring proof in the manner and
                    to the standard ordinarily required in proceedings before the enforcing court.
                    What he did accept was that the court should have regard to the tribunal’s
                    reasoning in reaching its own conclusion, and a statutory provision which gave
                    effect to an international convention of this kind should be construed with due
                    regard to the purpose of the convention and with a view to ensuring consistency
                    of interpretation and application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Aloe Vera</em>,
                    the second defendant, Mr Chiew, applied to set aside the order granting
                    leave on the grounds that the plaintiff had not crossed the preliminary hurdle
                    of establishing that there was an arbitration agreement between the parties.
                    Alternatively, enforcement should have been refused because the second defendant
                    was able to satisfy one or more of the grounds set out in s 31(2) and/or
                    s 31(4) of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In relation to establishing a ground for
                    refusal of recognition under s 31(2) of the IAA, Prakash J agreed with
                    the observations of Batts J even though the latter in the US District Court
                    in <em>Sarhank</em> case was overruled on appeal, in
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he court has been asked to enforce an international arbitral award in
                        which arbitrability has already been established under the laws of Egypt.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he Convention ... does not sanction second-guessing the arbitrator's
                        construction of the parties' agreement. ... It is well-settled that absent
                        "extraordinary circumstances", a confirming court is not to reconsider the
                        arbitrators' findings. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The arbitrators'] conclusion of partnership under the contract is one of

                        extraordinary circumstances exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is possible to reconcile <em>Dallah Estate</em> and <em>Aloe Vera</em>.
                    First, it must be remembered that <em>Dallah Estate</em>
                    only dealt with the second stage, <em>i.e</em>. the grounds
                    for refusal to enforce the award whereas <em>Aloe Vera</em>
                    was a case dealing with both stages. Second, in relation to the second stage of
                    enforcement, the two decisions may be reconciled. Moore Bick LJ in
                        <em>Dallah Estate</em> found it very difficult to
                    interpret the expression “furnish proof” as meaning anything other
                    than requiring proof in the manner and to the standard ordinarily required in
                    proceedings before the enforcing court. He was of the view that the grounds
                    raised required a full rehearing of the issues and not a mere review of the
                    arbitrator’s decision. Prakash J in <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em> (at [62]) seemed to give more deference to a
                    tribunal’s decision when she agreed with Batts J’s dicta in
                        <em>Sarhank</em> case and <em>Hebei
                        Import &amp; Export Corp v Polytek Engineering Co Ltd</em> [1999]
                    2 HKC 205 <em>(“Hebei</em> case<em>”)</em> that the approach towards the decisions of
                    foreign arbitral tribunals in Convention countries was to recognise the validity
                    of the same and give effect to them subject to basic notions of morality and
                    justice. As a side point, Prakash J’s reference to <em>Hebei</em>’s case for the proposition that the approach towards
                    the decisions of foreign arbitral tribunals in Convention countries was to
                    recognise the validity of the same and give effect to them subject to basic
                    notions of morality and justice, is in my view, with respect, misplaced since
                    the ground proceeded in <em>Hebei</em> case to resist
                    enforcement of the award was that it was contrary to the public policy of the
                    forum, thereby explaining the test of whether it was contrary to the fundamental
                    conceptions of morality and justice of the forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Returning to how <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em> and <em>Dallah Estate</em> can be
                    reconciled, I refer to Prakash J’s first point at [61] that the burden is
                    on the party who wishes the court to refuse enforcement of the award to
                    establish one of the grounds for refusal exists. Earlier at [47], Prakash J
                    held that the Singapore courts would not go behind the holding on the merits of
                    the foreign award except to the extent permitted by the New York Convention. In
                        <em>Aloe Vera</em>, the arbitration agreement was
                    subject to the law of Arizona. It was not correct to say that the enforcing
                    court has to construe the clauses of the Agreement in the same way as the
                    enforcing court would be able to if it were subject to Singapore law in order to
                    establish whether there was a valid arbitration agreement binding Mr Chiew.
                    It was for Mr Chiew to establish that under the law of Arizona, the clauses
                    could not have any application to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In evaluating the evidence, Prakash J
                    held at [63] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only evidence that Mr Chiew adduced of the law of Arizona was
                        contained in an affidavit filed by one Mr Steven Sullivan.
                        Mr Sullivan was Mr Chiew’s attorney in Arizona and, at the
                        hearing below, it was conceded that Mr Sullivan was not as an expert
                        but as an advocate for Mr Chiew, There was therefore no independent
                        expert evidence from Mr Chiew on the law of Arizona as it applied to
                        the Award. Also, as the assistant registrar found, Mr Sullivan's
                        affidavit essentially contained a rehash of the arguments (based on Arizona
                        laws, Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure and AAA rules) which were raised
                        before the Arbitrator and, subsequently, adjudicated and rejected by the
                        Arbitrator. Since Mr Chiew had not adduced expert evidence to show that
                        the Arbitrator's findings are incorrect under Arizona law, I agree with the
                        submission made by the plaintiff that there are no extraordinary
                        circumstances warranting a review of the Award. I am not the supervisory
                        court and cannot review the Arbitrator's decision in the same way that an
                        Arizona court could. <em>For me to refuse to enforce the
                            Award on this ground, I would need to be satisfied that, under the law
                            of Arizona, the arbitration agreement was invalid vis-à-vis
                            Mr Chiew and that the Arbitrator was not entitled to find that
                            Mr Chiew was a party to the Agreement and the arbitration.
                            No basis has been given to me for such a finding</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Read in this context, one extraordinary
                    circumstance in which Prakash J would have set the decision aside was if it
                    could be proven on a balance of probabilities that the arbitration agreement
                    under the law of Arizona was invalid vis-à-vis Mr Chiew and the arbitrator
                    was not entitled to find that Mr Chiew was a party to the agreement and the
                    arbitration under s 31(2) of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Although Prakash J at [63] uses the
                    phrase “review” of the arbitrator’s decision rather than a
                    “rehearing”, the specific point in issue in <em>Dallah Estate</em> as to whether the review is a limited review or a
                    full rehearing was not in issue and therefore not specifically decided in
                        <em>Aloe Vera</em>. However, there is indication that
                    where one of the grounds under s 31(2) of the IAA has been properly raised,
                    then a rehearing on that specific issue would be allowed because Prakash J
                    at [56] held</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except to the extent permitted by those grounds [s 31(2) of the IAA],
                        I cannot look into the merits of the Award and allow Mr Chiew to
                        re-litigate issues that he could have brought up either before the
                        Arbitrator or the supervisory court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Read in this light, <em>Dallah
                        Estate</em> and <em>Aloe Vera</em> may be read
                    consistently with each other, and the court is entitled to conduct a rehearing
                    based of the grounds prescribed in s 31(2) of the IAA. The party opposing
                    enforcement has the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court one of
                    the grounds prescribed by s 31(2) of the IAA. As I will explain shortly,
                    the problem that beset Ultrapolis is one of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Returning to the second issue proper, an
                    appropriate starting point is the preliminary issue of whether Ultrapolis is
                    estopped from challenging the enforceability of the Corrected Award given that
                    it did not challenge the Corrected Award in the supervisory courts of Denmark.
                        <em>Dallah Estate</em> considered whether a failure to
                    seek curial relief in the supervisory court but established a good defence
                    before the recognising court gave rise to an issue estoppel. In <em>Dallah Estate</em>, an award was given in favour of the
                    applicant against the respondent in France. The respondent chose not to
                    challenge the award in France even though the time limits for such a challenge
                    had not expired and raised before the English enforcing court the argument that
                    it was not a party to the arbitration agreement. The Court of Appeal held that
                    the defendant’s failure to pursue an appeal in France did not create an
                    estoppel which precluded reliance on the defence in the English enforcement
                    proceedings by relying on Kaplan J in <em>Paklito Investment
                        Ltd v Klockner East Asia Ltd</em> [1993] HKLR 39 where the
                    court held that the failure to seek an annulment in the curial court did not in
                    any way affect the independent and alternative right of the respondent to defend
                    enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Turning to the position under Singapore law,
                    in <em>Aloe Vera</em>, the arbitrator made a preliminary
                    order that Mr Chiew, the second defendant, was a proper party to the
                    arbitration. Mr Chiew disagreed with the arbitrator’s order and took
                    no further part in the arbitration proceedings. Subsequently, he sought to
                    challenge the enforcement of the foreign award on the ground that there was no
                    arbitration agreement because he was not a proper party to the arbitration.
                    Mr Chiew had two alternatives: to challenge the foreign award in the
                    foreign supervisory court, or to challenge enforcement of the foreign award in
                    Singapore. In the latter case, the challenge to enforcement was limited to the
                    extent permitted by the New York Convention. Prakash J held at [56]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the Award may be final in Arizona does not therefore mean
                        that Mr Chiew is excluded or precluded from resisting enforcement in
                        Singapore. He may still resist enforcement of the Award provided that he is
                        able to satisfy one of the Convention grounds under s 31(2) of the Act.
                        The grounds on which enforcement of an award may be resisted under the Act,
                        however, are not the same grounds that would entitle Mr Chiew to set
                        aside the Award in the jurisdiction of the supervisory court. …
                        <em>He may be able to resist enforcement here if he can
                            establish that the arbitration agreement was "not valid under the law to
                            which the parties have subjected it" within the meaning of that phrase
                            in s 31(2)(b). He is not, however, entitled to object to the
                            initial grant of leave to enforce on the basis that the Arbitrator erred
                            in holding that he was a party to the arbitration. As the enforcement
                            court, I can only permit Mr Chiew to resist enforcement if he is
                            able to establish one of the grounds set out in s 31(2) of the Act.
                            Except to the extent permitted by those grounds, I cannot look into the
                            merits of the Award and allow Mr Chiew to re-litigate issues that
                            he could have brought up either before the Arbitrator or the supervisory
                            court</em>. … This is because failure to raise such a point
                        may amount to an estoppel or a want of <em>bona
                            fides</em> such as to justify the court of enforcement in
                        enforcing an award. This, in fact, is what happened to the Government of
                        Lithuania in the <em>Svenska Petroleum</em> case.

                    only succeed on its submission that there was no valid arbitration agreement if
                    it can discharge its burden of establishing that s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA applies. Section 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Refusal of enforcement</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31. — (2)  A court so requested may refuse enforcement of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Under s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, the issue of whether there was a valid
                    arbitration agreement has to be determined based on foreign law (not under
                    Singapore law: see the clear wording of s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and <em>Aloe Vera</em> at
                    [61]). The English Court of Appeal in <em>Dallah
                        Estate</em> held that although the court would bear in mind the
                    purpose of the English Act 1996 and should have regard to the tribunal’s
                    reasoning in reaching its own conclusion, in determining whether the grounds for
                    refusal of enforcement of an award had been made out, the party who wishes the
                    enforcing court to refuse enforcement of the award must prove the existence of
                    the relevant matters on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the present facts, Ultrapolis alleges that
                    the arbitration agreement did not form part of the New Agreement. As I have
                    alluded to in <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above, Ultrapolis’s
                    problem was one of proof. The expert’s affidavit filed on behalf of
                    Ultrapolis was from Mr Andersen, the same Danish lawyer who had represented
                    Ultrapolis at the hearing before the Tribunal on the question of jurisdiction.
                    In his affidavit evidence, in which he did not cite any Danish law,
                    Mr Andersen concludes that the Standard Conditions did not form part of the
                    New Agreement. He opines that cl 13 of the New Agreement is not sufficient
                    to incorporate the arbitration clause in the Standard Conditions having taken
                    into account the issues, compared the wording of cl 13, the email of
                    7 December 2005 from Ultrapolis and the undisputed facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> There was reference to
                    Mr Romani’s email, but there was no mention of DSK’s answer by
                    way of Mr Christian Bursche’s reply email of the same day on
                    Mr Romani’s proposed changes to the contract which DSK did not fully
                    accept. Mr Jeremiah explained that the email of 7 December 2005 from
                    Ultrapolis dealt with technical matters and the terms the company had raised for
                    discussion. Clause 13 of the draft New Agreement was acceptable to both
                    parties and it was naturally not featured in the emails. Mr Jeremiah
                    submits that the exchange of emails were on the terms that parties disagreed
                    with. The Standard Conditions and cl 13 of the draft New Agreement were not
                    discussed in the emails as there was no objection to them. Like Mr Sullivan
                    in <em>AloeVera</em>, Mr Andersen’s affidavit
                    appears to be a rehash of his arguments before the Tribunal albeit on this
                    occasion he had confirmed his duty to the court as an expert on Danish
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In contrast to Mr Andersen’s
                    affidavit evidence, DSK’s expert is Mr Jens Rostock-Jensen, a partner
                    in the Danish law firm Kromann Reumert. Mr Rostock-Jensen’s
                    qualifications as an expert were not challenged, and hence, were accepted by
                    Ultrapolis. In addition, unlike Mr Andersen, Mr Rostock-Jensen is
                    independent of the proceedings before the Tribunal. Furthermore, in his
                    expert’s report exhibited to his affidavit filed on 22 December 2009,
                    Mr Rostock-Jensen explained Danish law on the subject and identified the
                    three basic requirements that must be satisfied in order for standard terms to
                    apply to a contract. He then explained how in his opinion a Danish court would
                    interpret the email communications between the parties and the facts to
                    determine if the three requirements were met. He went through the evidence in
                    relation to each requirement to arrive at the conclusion that in his opinion,
                    applying Danish law, a general reference to standard terms in an agreement (like
                    cl 13) can incorporate an arbitration clause in the Standard
                        Conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On the evidence,
                    Mr Rostock-Jensen was clear that Ultrapolis was provided with a copy of the
                    Standard Conditions on 2 December 2005 <em>before</em>
                    the New Agreement was signed. He further highlighted in paras 2.13 to 2.17 of
                    his expert’s report the specific circumstances of the case which would
                    persuade a Danish court to apply the Standard Conditions, and in particular
                    cl 19. Mr Rostock-Jensen opined that an arbitration clause and
                    governing law clause (as in cl 19) are common in international business,
                    especially shipping, and there would have been no need to highlight the
                    arbitration clause to the other party (for example an entity like Ultrapolis who
                    was a “professional” party being a investment company who in 2004
                    started to invest in the yacht business) for it to apply to the contract. It
                    follows that Ultrapolis would have to reject the clauses in order not to be
                    bound by them, and there was no such rejection in its email of 7 December
                    2005. Being satisfied that all three requirements were met,
                    Mr Rostock-Jensen concluded that under Danish law, both the governing law
                    clause and the arbitration clause in the Standard Conditions would have been
                    incorporated into the contract by reference in cl 13 and the Danish court
                    would come to the same decision (see para 2.19 of report). For these
                    reasons, I prefer DSK’s expert evidence and in doing so conclude that on a
                    balance of probabilities no basis has been given by Ultrapolis that the Tribunal
                    was not entitled to find under Danish law that cl 19 of the Standard
                    Conditions formed part of the New Agreement. Accordingly, Ultrapolis has failed
                    to discharge its burden in satisfying the court that s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA on the refusal to enforcement a foreign
                    award applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Third issue: whether the composition of the arbitral authority was in
                accordance with the arbitration agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     This third issue is the first of two fallback
                    arguments raised by Mr Singh. Ultrapolis in seeking to argue that the court
                    should refuse enforcement of the Corrected Award relied on
                        s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA because of two
                    related arguments. First, Ultrapolis argues that cl 19.3 instead of
                    cl 19.2 of the Standard Conditions applies to the dispute between the
                    parties so the dispute should have been determined by the Danish
                    Engineers’ Association, and not the Tribunal (the Danish Arbitration
                    Institute). Second, Ultrapolis argues that even if cl 19.2 of the Standard
                    Conditions applies, it does not clearly state that the Tribunal should determine
                    the dispute on fees. Section 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the
                    IAA provides:</p>

                        appealed to the General Court of Arbitration in Denmark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In relation to the first argument,
                    Mr Andersen in his affidavit evidence was of the view that cl 19.2 did
                    not make a clear reference to the Tribunal. However, he did not provide any
                    affidavit evidence of which tribunal the parties were in fact referring to. On
                    the other hand, DSK’s expert, Mr Rostock-Jensen, explained in his
                    affidavit that pursuant to Danish contract law, the General Court of Arbitration
                    in Denmark (in cl 19.2 of the Standard Conditions) refers to the Tribunal.
                    As it is for Ultrapolis to establish that s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA applies, Ultrapolis has failed through its expert,
                    Mr Andersen, to establish that the Tribunal was not the proper tribunal to
                    hear the dispute in Denmark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In relation to Mr Singh’s second
                    argument that cl 19.3 applies instead of cl 19.2 of the Standard
                    Conditions, it is noteworthy that Mr Andersen did not cover this point in
                    his affidavit. DSK’s expert on the other hand is of the opinion that as
                    cl 19.2 was the general rule and cl 19.3 of the Standard Conditions
                    was the exception, cl 19.3 had to be interpreted restrictively. Under
                    Danish law such a claim for fixed fees in a fixed price contract would be
                    outside the scope of cl 19.3 of the Standard Conditions and instead be
                    governed by cl 19.2. Mr Rostock-Jensen explained that cl 19.3 is
                    meant for cases where there is a challenge to the amount of hourly fees charged
                    and the Danish Engineers’ Association referred to in cl 19.3 is
                    equipped to assess the reasonableness of the hourly rate that is being charged.
                    In his opinion, under Danish law, cl 19.2 is the correct provision
                    governing the dispute which was not only on the amount of the fees charged but
                    also the performance of DSK under the contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, Ultrapolis
                    has undoubtedly failed to discharge its burden in showing that the arbitration
                    was not in accordance with Danish law under s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA. In reaching this conclusion, it is not necessary
                    to deal with s 3 of the Danish Arbitration Act 2005, which Mr Jeremiah
                    referred me to on the question of waiver, since Ultrapolis did not raise
                    cl 19.3 at the hearing of the preliminary issue before the
                Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fourth issue: whether the Tribunal was functus officio when it issued
                the Corrected Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Ultrapolis argues that enforcement of the
                    Corrected Award should be refused under s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA because the Tribunal was <em>functus officio</em> when it issued the Corrected Award (by inserting
                    the dates when such interest accrued and changing the name of the claimant in
                    the arbitration on account of its voluntary liquidation).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Tribunal passed the First Award on
                    11 February 2009 where it found for the claimant in the arbitration, DSK,
                    and ordered that Ultrapolis pay EUR 357,855 with interest of 1.5% per month as
                    well as costs of the arbitration case of EUR 23,406 to the claimant, DSK, within
                    14 days of the award. On 20 February 2009, the claimant in the arbitration
                    wrote to the Tribunal seeking to correct the First Award on the ground that (a)
                    there was no reference to the dates on which interest started to accrue and (b)
                    the claimant was named as Knud E. Hansen A/S in the award which was not its
                    present name. It is noteworthy that the dates on which interest started to run
                    was already before the Tribunal as it was set out in the claimant’s
                    statement of claim. The Tribunal issued a Corrected Award dated 16 April
                    2009 which specified the date from which interest started to accrue and it also
                    reflected the change in the claimant’s name from Knud E. Hansen A/S to
                    DSK. Mr Singh is aware that the question of whether the Tribunal was
                        <em>functus officio</em> is determined by Danish law,
                    but having not produced evidence of Danish law on the matter, he relies on
                    Singapore law to argue that the Corrected Award may only be amended to correct
                    clerical mistakes on the basis that Danish law is not different from Singapore
                    law on the topic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Under s 31(2)(<em>e</em>) of the IAA, the agreement of the parties is that Danish law
                    would apply to the agreement between them. Whether the Tribunal was <em>functus officio</em> should be decided in accordance with
                    Danish law. Mr Pedersen in para 16 of his affidavit stated that it was
                    within the Tribunal’s power to issue the Corrected Award in that pursuant
                    to s 33 of the Danish Arbitration Act 2005 (Act No. 553 of 24 June
                    2005 on Arbitration), the Tribunal may correct any clerical or typographical
                    error of a similar nature within 30 days of the receipt of a request from a
                    party to the arbitration. It is for Ultrapolis to rebut DSK’s position
                    advanced by Mr Pedersen by adducing Danish law which it has not done. By
                    not doing so, it is not proper to ask the court to presume that Danish law and
                    Singapore law are the same (or not necessarily different) on the issue of
                    whether the Tribunal was <em>functus officio</em> when it
                    issued the Corrected Award. In the circumstances, para 16 of
                    Mr Pedersen’s affidavit setting out the position under Danish law is
                    not rebutted in the absence of evidence of Danish law to the contrary. The
                    Tribunal considered the request justified and agreed to exercise its powers to
                    correct what were errors arising from clerical or typographical errors since the
                    start dates of interest were already specified in the claimant’s statement
                    of claim. Equally, the change of name of the claimant happened after arbitration
                    commenced and the correction of the error in the name would clarify or remove
                    any ambiguity in the Final Award. Both corrections were not tantamount to
                    corrections of mistakes in the Tribunal’s findings whether those mistakes
                    were mistakes of fact or mistakes of law. Accordingly, for the reasons stated,
                    the Tribunal was not <em>functus officio</em> when it
                    issued the Corrected Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In summary, the challenge to the enforcement
                    of the Corrected Award is without merit because (a) DSK has satisfied the
                    requirements under s 30(1)(<em>b</em>) of the IAA to
                    produce a certified copy of the Standard Conditions which contained an
                    arbitration clause; and (b) Ultrapolis has failed to establish any of the
                    grounds under s 31(2) sub-paras (<em>b</em>) and
                        (<em>e</em>) of the IAA for setting aside the Corrected
                    Award. Accordingly, leave is granted to DSK to enforce the Corrected Award in
                    Arbitration case file E-1001 passed on 16 April 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark
                    at the Danish Institute of Arbitration in the same manner as a Judgment of the
                    High Court of Singapore. Further, judgment in terms of the Corrected Award is
