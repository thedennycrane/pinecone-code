These properties, while part of the same estate, did not overlap with the Disputed Properties. The defendants objected to the plaintiffs’ title to sue on the ground that, despite the Original Order, the plaintiffs were not the properly appointed trustees of the Estate. The High Court held that the defendants could intervene in the Original Proceedings and set aside the Original Order to the extent that it related to the four properties there disputed, on grounds that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure of material facts to the court in the Original Proceedings. The salient parts of the court’s decision warrant reproduction in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 … I accept that in the ordinary case, any change in the ownership or trusteeship of the reversion does not affect or concern the leaseholder… However, in the absence of an estoppel, the tenant or the leaseholder is not prevented from challenging the title of the landlord… In this case, the plaintiffs rely on the court order to assert that they are the properly appointed trustees of the testator’s estate. It is open to the defendants to challenge that assertion. If this challenge involves a review of the propriety of the court order and the manner in which that order was procured, I am sure it is open to the defendants to ask the court to undertake such a review. They have a sufficient interest to question the propriety of the application in the 1992 proceedings and the consequent order in so far as they affect the four properties owned by them… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 I do not think that it matters that the defendants were not joined as parties to the 1992 proceedings. If they have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the proceedings the court will allow them to intervene in those proceedings. I also do not accept Mr Chung’s point that the defendants have waited too long to question the validity of the order. I accept Mr Dyne’s explanation that time was required for them and their advisers to investigate the matter, which has such an involved history, to put them in a position to show what was wrong with the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 Where there is a wrong, there is a remedy, or there ought to be one. I have no doubt that, given the circumstances in which the order was procured, it is open to being set aside, at least in so far as it relates to the four properties concerned… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Notably, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings </span>opined that the defendants had taken “too timid a position when they say that they cannot apply to set the order aside because they were not a party to those proceedings” (at [43]), and invited them to file an application to intervene and set aside the Original Order to the extent of the four properties there disputed to “put the procedural aspects in order”, without need for further evidence or submissions (at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The second decision was <span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee v Syed </span><span class="font-italic">Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad </span>[1997] SGHC 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee</span>”). Here, the plaintiffs sought a declaration of their leasehold entitlement to certain properties of the Estate, which did not overlap with the Disputed Properties or with the properties subject of <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings</span>. In respect of the issue of the defendants’ capacity to act as trustees of the Estate and defend the proceedings, the High Court relied on <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings </span>for the proposition that the defendants’ appointment was defective and opined as follows (at [81]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Like Dickson Holdings Pte Ltd in Suit No. 1837 of 1994 and other leaseholders whose interests have been adversely affected thereby, the plaintiffs should take steps to intervene in OS 1122 of 1992 before applying to set aside the 1992 Order made against the properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Accordingly, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee </span>granted the various declarations sought by the plaintiffs on the ground that the defendants’ title “had been impugned [and] their capacity to act as trustees for the [Estate] is questionable” (at [93]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Originating Summons No 69 of 1998</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In 1998, in light of the ensuing litigation over the validity of appointment of the fourth to seventh respondents as trustees under the Original Order, the first respondent and one Sharifah Fatimah Binte Abdul Kader Aljunied (“Sharifah”), who were beneficiaries of the Estate, applied to court to be substituted as trustees.

The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span> stated the rule as follows (at para 15/6/6): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An application to intervene after a judgment is given or a final order is made will not be entertained as the proceedings can no longer be said to be pending as required by O 15 r 6(2):<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">United Asian Bank v Personal Representative of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Roshammah, deceased </span>[1994] 3 MLJ 327, at 335;<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Hong Leong Finance v Staghorn</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[1995] 2 MLJ 847. However, there may be circumstances in which matters remain to be resolved after judgment, in which case the court has a discretion to add a party for this purpose. In<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Duke of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Buccleuch </span>[1892] P 201, an order for joinder after liability had been determined at trial was affirmed as damages and the persons to receive them had yet to be assessed. Although the case involved admiralty proceedings, the judgments indicate that the court has a discretion to join a party after the determination of liability where this is appropriate:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I base my decision upon the words ‘at any stage of the proceedings’ … They apply, in my opinion, as long as anything remains to be done in the case. In this case there remains the assessment of damages. In this instance the names of other persons are necessary to settle the questions at issue … It is the duty of the court to add the names of the right plaintiffs. [Per Fry LJ at 212; also see 208.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Two cases were cited as authorities by the first and second respondents in support of this rule limiting the time period during which an application to intervene may be filed. The first was <span class="font-italic">United Asian Bank</span><span class="font-italic"> Bhd v Personal representative of Roshammah (decd) &amp; Ors</span> [1994] 3 MLJ 327 (“<span class="font-italic">Roshammah</span>”), in which the court stated that an intervention application would be in time only if it was filed before the final order had been made:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Intervention to be legitimate must qualify with the conditions prescribed by O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) or (ii)… It may be permitted at any stage of the proceedings. This means it must be applied for before the final order is made, not after it has been perfected and extracted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The second authority was <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Finance</span><span class="font-italic"> Bhd v Staghorn Sdn Bhd</span> [1995] 2 MLJ 847 (“<span class="font-italic">Staghorn</span>”), in which the court affirmed Fry LJ’s statement in <span class="font-italic">The Duke of </span><span class="font-italic">Buccleuch</span> [1892] P 201 that an application for intervention would qualify as being made “at any stage of the proceedings” “as long as anything remains to be done in the case”, such as an assessment of damages (at 212). Accordingly, the court in <span class="font-italic">Staghorn </span>applied the test of whether “anything remained to be done” to the facts of that case as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are of the view that after 18 February 1991, when the certificate of sale was issued by the registrar of the High Court, nothing further remained to be done in the proceedings. There were no proceedings in existence after that date. The court would have had no jurisdiction thereafter to make any order under O 15 r 6(2). The proceedings came to an end upon the issuance of the certificate of sale on 18 February 1992, and therefore the order for intervention which was made on 30 January 1995, or the summons for leave to intervene which was filed on 4 December 1993, had not been made or issued ‘at any stage of the proceedings’ as required by O 15 r 6(2). This is because there was no stage of the proceedings in existence after 18 February 1992 as the issuance of the certificate of sale pursuant to s 259(3)(a) of the Code was the final stage of the proceedings for an order of sale under O 83.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I accepted the general rule as stated in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The positions in <span class="font-italic">Roshammah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Staghorn</span>, when scrutinised in detail,<span class="font-italic"> </span>may not be entirely consistent, but that did not concern us in the present case. I also did not consider <span class="font-italic">AHPETC </span>directly applicable to the facts of this case, and indeed neither party made arguments in that regard. In our case, the summons for leave to intervene was filed only in 2015, whereas the Original Proceedings in which intervention was sought had concluded in 1992, with the Original Order being made on 27 November 1992. A whole 23 years had lapsed in the interim between the Original Proceedings and the present application. Even if the Original Proceedings were susceptible to appeal, the time for appeal had long since lapsed and an extension of time was highly improbable given the considerable length of delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For these reasons, as the Original Order had been made – and the Original Proceedings had been concluded with nothing remaining to be done – in 1992, O 15 r 6(2) did not apply. The considerable passage of time in this case was not simply a matter of lateness, but went instead to the jurisdictional scope of O 15 r 6(2). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Just and convenient to allow the intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In any event, O 15 r 6(2) could not assist the Applicants as it was not “just and convenient” in the circumstances of this case to allow the intervention. Generally, this inquiry “requires the court to take into account the interests of the existing parties to the action… as well as that of the party to be joined” (<span class="font-italic">AHPETC</span> at [39]). To this end, the lateness of the application to intervene is a relevant factor, particularly if the resisting parties can show satisfaction of “the critical question of prejudice, which is not to be automatically assumed” (<span class="font-italic">AHPETC</span> at [39]-[40]). In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span>, it was also observed that “[t]he lateness of an application is often a significant factor in determining whether it is ‘just and convenient’” (at para 15/6/6; see also <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 15/6/2). While principles drawn from, and analogies to, decided cases may be helpful, the issue of whether the proposed intervention would be “just and convenient” must, in the final analysis, be fact and case specific. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the present case, I did not consider the “just and convenient” requirement to be satisfied. First, as mentioned, it had been 23 years since the Original Order was made in 1992. This considerable lapse of time itself militated strongly against allowing the intervention, as the records and memories would necessarily have deteriorated and intervention after such a long period would effectively reopen the matter after its erstwhile conclusion. Thus, much like the situation in <span class="font-italic">Chan Kern </span><span class="font-italic">Miang v Kea Resources </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 85, intervention would result in parties having to “literally start all over again” (at [23]) by filing new affidavits and attending new hearings with new counsel before a different judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, the presence of the Subsequent Order also complicated matters for the Applicants, since the first and second respondents as present trustees of the Estate argued that the Subsequent Order had superseded the Original Order and was the court order from which their authority stemmed. This meant that the Applicants’ intervention into the Original Proceeding, even if allowed, would not facilitate the clean and convenient resolution of the gravamen of the parties’ dispute, but may instead give rise to a series of intractable litigation over the relationship between the Original and Subsequent Orders, and the effect of <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings</span>, <span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee</span>, and Notice of Appointment as an additional overlay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thirdly, it was also relevant that the first and second respondents, who were the main active respondents in this application, had not been parties to the Original Order, though their present interests would ultimately be tied to that Original Order. To allow intervention by the Applicants would thus, in effect, be to countenance a curious situation where two sides litigate in the name of a proceeding to which neither party had been privy or party. There was in these circumstances a real risk that the first and second respondents would be embarrassed in the conduct of their substantive case against setting aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Applicants argued that in an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>context, there was no requirement that it be “just and convenient” to determine the question or issue <span class="font-italic">as between the existing parties </span>to the cause or matter<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which intervention was sought. That may be true, but it does not obviate the “just and convenient” inquiry entirely. The language of O 15 r 6(2) clearly states that the Court must consider it “just and convenient to determine [the issue] as between him and that party <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> between the parties to the cause or matter” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Applicants also relied heavily on the cases of <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings </span>and <span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee</span>, which suggested that parties aggrieved by the Original Order may intervene in the Original Proceedings to set it aside. Those cases did not consider O 15 r 6(2). In any event, the inquiry of what is “just and convenient” must depend heavily on the factual context. What may be “just and convenient” in 1997 may no longer be the case in 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Accordingly, it was neither just nor convenient for leave to be granted for the Applicants to intervene in the Original Proceedings, and the Applicants’ reliance on O 15 r 6(2) as the basis for their application must accordingly fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Inherent jurisdiction of the Court </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Applicants also invoked the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Indeed, they appeared to have placed primary reliance on this basis. As a matter of principle, I accepted that the court had an inherent jurisdiction to allow an application for intervention or joinder if such an order would be in the interests of justice, even if O 15 r 6(2) did not apply (<span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim </span>at [20]-[22]; see also <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 15/6/10; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span> at para 15/6/10).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal provided the following guidance on how the court’s inherent jurisdiction to allow intervention should be exercised: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27     It seems to us clear that by its very nature, how an inherent jurisdiction, whether as set out in O 92 r 4 or under common law, should be exercised should not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests. In each instance the court must exercise it judiciously. In his lecture on “The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court” published in<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Current Legal Problems 1970</span>, Sir Jack Jacob (until lately the general editor of the<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Supreme Court Practice</span>) opined that this jurisdiction may be invoked when it is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression and to do justice between the parties. Without intending to be exhaustive, we think an essential touchstone is really that of “need”...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30     The question might well be asked, what prejudice would the intervention cause to the complainant/applicant. But we do not think that that is the correct approach upon which to invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction. It may well be that the question of prejudice is relevant to determine whether intervention should be allowed in the circumstances of a case. But that is not to say that once no prejudice is shown, the court should invoke that jurisdiction. There must nevertheless be reasonably strong or compelling reasons showing why that jurisdiction should be invoked.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The touchstone of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to permit intervention or joinder is the “strict criterion” of necessity (<span class="font-italic">Family Food Court v </span><span class="font-italic">Seah Boon Lock</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 272 at [63]). The absence of prejudice, while relevant, does not itself suffice. Due consideration will be given to the concerns of due process and fairness as between the parties. Ultimately, the court’s inherent jurisdiction “should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands” (<span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 at [17]). This is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> the case if there is an existing rule already covering the situation at hand, whether in statute, subsidiary legislation, or rule of court (<span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span><span class="font-italic"> Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 at [81]). Indeed, in these situations where there is an existing rule, such as O 15 r 6(2) in the present case, “a party which urges the court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction or power to circumvent the rule has to show that it is in the interests of justice to disregard the rule” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Siew </span><span class="font-italic">Ngug v Lee Brothers (Wee Kee) Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 1093 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the present application, I was not satisfied that it would be in the interests of justice to allow the Applicants’ intervention. As discussed earlier, the considerable passage of time, the complications over the relevance of the Original Order, and the fact that the Applicants’ real dispute was against non-parties to the Original Proceedings, all militated against the exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction. By reason of these factors, there was a real risk of embarrassment in the first and second respondents’ defence against the setting aside of the Original Order if intervention were allowed. The material changes in circumstance since <span class="font-italic">Dickson Holdings </span>and <span class="font-italic">Koh Beng Swee </span>also meant that I had to consider afresh what would be in the interests of justice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Critically, the necessity of this entire undertaking was not clear, as the Applicants had in Suit 263 sought, and later obtained, declarations that their leasehold interest in the Disputed Properties had not been extinguished or merged with the Respondents’ reversionary interest. This was therefore unlike <span class="font-italic">AHPETC</span>, in which the Court of Appeal allowed the joinder as it would otherwise be “a waste of time and expense… [to] require the [non-party] to initiate fresh proceedings that would give rise to the same or similar issues” (at [41]). Permitting intervention here would in fact create a multiplicity of proceedings. The Applicants’ fear of possible repercussions arising from the Original Order if it were not set aside despite my orders in Suit 263, such as the purported possibility that “in another 10 years or so, [the first and second respondents or their successors] would again find alleged cause… to interfere with [their leasehold interests]”,

</div> In my view, these submissions, while perhaps pertinent if the court were concerned with the propriety of setting aside the Original Order as such, were not relevant to the preliminary issue of intervention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the foregoing reasons, neither O 15 r 6(2) nor the court’s inherent jurisdiction could be relied on by the Applicants in this case. Accordingly, the Applicants’ summons for leave to intervene in the Original Proceedings, set aside the Original Order, and make consequential rectifications on the Registry of Deeds was dismissed. It may be that the Applicants have concerns about the impact of the Original Order, but these are best addressed by other proceedings, rather than allowing an intervention here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the issue of costs, the parties’ submissions were considered and the following orders were made: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) no indemnity costs are ordered;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) from the Applicants to the first and second respondents: $12,000 all in; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) from the Applicants to the sixth respondent (in person): $3000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The decision on costs was conveyed by letter dated 7 December 2016.
