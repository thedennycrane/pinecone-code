The first, in May 2012, involved the installation of a “skylight canopy”, skylight windows and ventilation globes, as well as minor repair works. Molly and Ross were very impressed with the quality of the 2nd Defendant’s work on this job. They paid the 2nd Defendant a total of $21,496.30 for the job

They contacted Chong NK in August 2012 to tell him of their plans to build an extension to the rear of No. 17 (similar to the works he had done at the rear of No. 25), and asked him for a cost quotation. According to Molly, Chong NK assured them that the 2nd Defendant had the expertise for the job. On their asking, he also assured them that the similar works at No. 25 had been “eventually approved by JTC”. He stated that JTC approval would have to be similarly sought for the works at No. 17 and that he would give his quotation after calculating the cost of obtaining “the necessary approvals”

Molly struck me as an honest – indeed, guileless – witness not given to embellishment or exaggeration. In particular, she was frank in conceding that prior to the fire on 30 April 2013, she had not done any searches to check if the 2nd Defendant was a BCA-registered contractor

Again, like Molly, he appeared to me to be an honest witness who did not try to avoid giving evidence which reflected unfavourably on his own firm (for example, the reason for the delay in the submission of structural plans to the BCA, which I will come to later). This did not mean that Molly was lying when she denied having met one “TK” or when she asserted that ETS had been recommended by Chong NK. Whilst Chong NK claimed that he had introduced “TK” to Molly, he was completely unable to recall how he had made this introduction – whether he had, for example, simply given Molly “a telephone number” or whether he had made the introduction in person

</div>. Although Francis recalled having been approached by “TK” about the job at No. 17, he did not give any evidence of any meeting he had with Molly at which “TK” was also present. “TK” himself was never called as a witness by either party. It was entirely plausible, therefore, that ETS came to know of the job at No. 17 through “TK” but that Molly never met “TK”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Having reviewed the evidence given by Molly, Chong NK and Francis, I came to the following conclusions. Firstly, the 1st Defendant clearly did pay heed to Chong NK’s request for a consultant to assist in making the submissions for government approvals; and by the time the 2nd Defendant’s quotation of 25 February 2013 was accepted, ETS was already in place as the consultant responsible for making the submissions – and had in fact made several of the submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, given Francis’s evidence about having met “with the owner and with the contractor” two to three times at No. 17 prior to giving Molly his quotation, I found that there was reasonable basis for Molly – and thus the 1st Defendant – to believe that the 2nd Defendant and ETS would be liaising and communicating with each other in relation to the commencement and execution of the A&amp;A works at No. 17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thirdly, it was in fact true that the 2nd Defendant and ETS had communicated with each other in relation to the A&amp;A works. Whilst Francis could not remember Chong NK’s name, I did not find this surprising given the lapse of time. In any event, there was no suggestion by anyone – least of all Chong NK himself – that the 2nd Defendant had some other “boss” besides Chong NK. Francis’s testimony – again unchallenged – was that after his first meeting with the “boss of Formcraft [i.e. the 2nd Defendant]” and after the issuance of ETS’s quotation, he visited the Formcraft office again to provide the “boss” with a “draft copy” of the plans for the works at No. 17

Francis explained that although at that point there were no structural drawings yet and therefore no detailed plans, he had given a draft to the “boss of Formcraft” to show him the extension works to be carried out at the rear of No. 17.

It was apparent to me that Chong NK had persisted with commencing the A&amp;A works despite Francis’s express instructions not to do so until structural approval and the permit to commence work had been given by the BCA. It was also apparent that having flouted the consultant’s instructions, Chong NK was desperate to distance himself from the said works, to the extent that he even claimed – absurdly – that he had “no plans, no consultant, no instructions” in relation to the A&amp;A works

Unfortunately, “TK” took a long time in reverting to ETS with the structural plans, and the AC recommended by him also took a long time to complete the checking of the plans and calculations. ETS apparently did not chase the AC because it was “a very busy period”

</div> at [34]) was explained by the High Court in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (HC)</span> (at [34] to [38]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 … [T]here is generally no justification, either in policy or in principle, for the imposition of vicarious liability for the acts of independent contractors. In [<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 3 SLR 540], Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, explained at [76] that two important policy considerations underpinned the doctrine of vicarious liability, namely: (a) effective compensation for the victim and (b) deterrence of future harm by encouraging employers to take steps to reduce the incidence of accidents or tortious behaviour by their employees through efficient organisation and supervision. However, neither of these aims would be achieved through the imposition of vicarious liability for the acts of independent contractors.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Independent contractors are hired in a variety of situations and engaged to perform a variety of tasks and it is very often the case that the hirers are individuals, rather than persons who are carrying on a business. Often, these hirers do not possess the financial wherewithal to make good the losses sustained by the torts of these contractors. Further, they are often in no position to exert any meaningful control over the activities of independent contractors since they are not part of their organisation. To make the hirers vicariously liable for the acts of independent contractors would neither serve the aim of victim compensation nor that of effective deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 But even if it could be shown that the aims of victim compensation and deterrence could be achieved through the imposition of vicarious liability on these hirers, it would not be enough. As Chan CJ cautioned at [81] of <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>, “[t]he courts are … neither welfare agencies nor workplace safety regulators”. The fact that a person can easily bear a loss does not, without more, justify the conclusion that the law ought to make him do so. Tort law is still primarily a system of norms of personal responsibility and a principled moral basis for the imposition of liability is required … This moral basis can be found in the concept of “enterprise risk”, which Chan CJ alluded to at [77] of <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>, where he wrote, “a person who employs another to advance his own interests and thereby creates a risk of his employee committing a tort should bear responsibility for any adverse consequences resulting therefrom”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 The concept of an “enterprise risk” … is not just a unifying idea or grand theme but the normative foundation for the doctrine of vicarious liability. As Rix LJ put it in <span class="font-italic">Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Lt</span>d [2006] 2 WLR 428 at [55], “those who set in motion and profit from the activities of their employees should compensate those who are injured by such activities even when performed negligently”. In short, where the incidence of benefit falls, so, too, should the risk. Since employers, through engaging in business, have put the risk of tortious acts arising out into the world, they should be liable when the risk eventuates.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 The point, for present purposes, is that the imposition of vicarious liability for the acts of independent contractors can <span class="font-italic">never</span> be justified on the basis of the theory of enterprise risk. By definition, an independent contractor is one who is <span class="font-italic">not</span> part of the hirer’s organisation and is instead a person who is “performing services as a person of business on his own account” … The independent contractor carries on business for <span class="font-italic">his own</span> benefit, and thus, any risks of harm arising from the independent contractor’s conduct (the enterprise risk) should properly fall on the independent contractor alone …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the “independent contractor defence” applied in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In assessing whether the 2nd Defendant was an independent contractor of the 1st Defendant, I applied firstly the “control” test. To quote the learned editors of <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span> (Michael Jones gen ed) (22nd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span>”) at para 6-03, the distinction between employees and independent contractors has “[t]raditionally … [been] taken to lie in the different amounts of control exercisable by the employer, particularly control over the manner in which the work was to be done”. This was alluded to by the CA in <span class="font-italic">BNM (administratrix of the estate of B, deceased)</span><span class="font-italic"> on her own behalf and on behalf of others v National University of Singapore and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 4 SLR 931 (“<span class="font-italic">BNM</span>”)

</div>, in which the CA had to consider, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether the company engaged by the National University of Singapore (“NUS”) to supply lifeguards for its swimming pool was an independent contractor. In holding that it was, the CA stated (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The distinction between the ability to tell a worker <span class="font-italic">what</span> to do and the ability to tell him <span class="font-italic">how</span> to do it is significant: in [<span class="font-italic">Mersey Docks and Harbour</span><span class="font-italic"> Board v Coggins &amp; Griffith (Liverpool) Limited</span> [1947] AC 1], the court held that the employment of the craneman was not transferred from the harbour authority to the stevedores because although the stevedores could tell the craneman what they wanted him to do, they had no authority to tell him how he was to handle the crane in doing his work …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Applying the “control” test to the present case, it was plain that the 1st Defendant did not exercise any control at all over the manner in which the A&amp;A works were to be done. Chong NK himself conceded that he was the one who would go to the worksite in the mornings to arrange the work for his workers and to do inspections, and he also took on the supervision of their work; and although, as noted earlier, he admitted that he split his time between a few different worksites, there was no suggestion – even by Chong NK himself – that in his absence, the 1st Defendant’s personnel would step in to supervise the manner in which his workers carried out their work. Indeed, as noted at [43] above, Chong NK’s claims about having assigned a “technical controller” and a “part-time supervisor” to the No. 17 site – whilst not credible in themselves – suggested that he was all too aware that supervision and thus control of the manner in which his workers did the work at No. 17 lay firmly with the 2nd Defendant and not with the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As the CA pointed out in <span class="font-italic">BNM</span> (at [28]–[29]), however, the control test “is not the only test for determining whether a contractor is an independent contractor, nor is it even necessarily the decisive factor. … [T]he fundamental test to be applied is whether the contractor was performing services as a person of business on his own account”. In this connection, the CA quoted from the judgment of Cooke J in <span class="font-italic">Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social </span><span class="font-italic">Security</span> [1969] 2 QB 173, in which Cooke J had noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The most that can be said is that control will no doubt always have to be considered, although it can no longer be regarded as the sole determining factor; and that factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment, whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Applying the CA’s analytical approach in <span class="font-italic">BNM</span> (at [31]–[32]) to the present facts, it was evident that the 2nd Defendant deployed its own workers, undertook the financial risks of running its business, retained the profits to be made from its business, and charged for goods and services tax (“GST”). As to the deployment of workers, I have already referred to Chong NK’s evidence about his going to the worksite in the mornings to arrange the work for his workers. As to the retention of responsibility for financial risks as well as the retention of profits, this could be seen in particular from the quotation issued by the 2nd Defendant

</div> – a factor which the CA found relevant in <span class="font-italic">BNM</span> (at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Having regard to the factors set out above, I had no doubt that in carrying out the A&amp;A works at No. 17, the 2nd Defendant was (as the 1st Defendant alleged) an independent contractor. Applying the general principles espoused by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA</span>), this meant that the 1st Defendant could not be held vicariously liable for the 2nd Defendant’s negligence in carrying out these works. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the 1st Defendant had exercised due care in selecting and appointing the 2nd Defendant as their contractor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, given that the “independent contractor defence” applied, the 1st Defendant did owe a duty of care to persons such as the Plaintiff, who might be affected by the actions of the independent contractor, to exercise reasonable care and skill in the selection of a suitable contractor (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> (<span class="font-italic">HC</span>) at [43]). This was the next issue I had to consider – whether the 1st Defendant exercised reasonable care in selecting the 2nd Defendant as its contractor.  I decided this issue in the 1st Defendant’s favour, for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standard of care</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As noted earlier, the 1st Defendant’s selection of the 2nd Defendant as its contractor was based primarily on the recommendation of a neighbouring land-owner at No. 25 Link Road (Mdm Poh) who had arranged for similar works on her property, the visual inspections by Molly and Ross of the similar works done at No. 25, and their satisfaction with the quality of the 2nd Defendant’s work in the two jobs undertaken at No. 17 prior to the A&amp;A works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In considering whether the above sufficed as due care, the standard which I had to apply was “that of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the defendant” (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> (<span class="font-italic">CA</span>) at [73]). In other words, I had to “have regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, including the applicable industry practices, and then ascertain, on this basis, what a reasonable person in the [1st Defendant’s] position would have done” (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> (<span class="font-italic">CA</span>) at [73]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As for industry practice, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng </span>(<span class="font-italic">CA</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>has made it clear (at [74]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Industry standards and common practice have long been viewed as important, although not necessarily conclusive, factors in ascertaining the appropriate standard of care … [W]hen receiving evidence of what is alleged to be a common and approved practice so as to assess the standard of care appropriate in a particular set of circumstances, the court should of course examine the practice against considerations of logic and common sense. This is only sensible since negligent conduct does not cease to be so simply on account of repetition and normalisation. In assessing the standard of care to be met, therefore, it would be just as unwise to accept a common industry practice uncritically as it would be to simply ignore it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevance of expert evidence to the court’s assessment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant each called its own expert witness to give evidence of industry standards and practice. The experts’ assistance would have been relevant and useful on the question of what the 1st Defendant could reasonably have been expected to do prior to appointing the 2nd Defendant as contractor. <span class="font-italic">Hong Cassley and others v GMP Securities Europe LLP and another</span> [2015] EWHC 722 (QB) is an example of how expert evidence may be used in such cases. This case concerned a claim in negligence brought by the family of the deceased Mr Cassley against his employers GMP Securities Europe LLP (“GMP”) and another company called Sundance Resources Limited (“Sundance”). Mr Cassley was on a chartered flight passing over a remote area of the Republic of Congo when the aircraft he was in crashed into a hillside and killed all the persons on board. Mr Cassley was then on a business trip undertaken on behalf of GMP. The aircraft had been chartered from a Congolese charter flight company (“Aero-Service”) by Sundance: Mr Cassley was on that trip because GMP had been trying to win the instruction to act as Sundance’s representative in the raising of finance for the latter’s mining project. The court found that the accident occurred for a number of reasons mainly related to failings on the part of Aero-Service, including the lack of any formal safety procedures at Aero-Service, its lack of any facility for flight planning and the absence of any aeronautical charts on board the aircraft. Having also found that both GMP and Sundance owed non-delegable duties of care to Mr Cassley, the court then considered what steps were reasonably required to be taken by GMP and Sundance in the discharge of their respective duties of care – whether, for example, GMP and/or Sundance should have engaged an independent aviation consultant; and in this connection, the court had regard to the evidence of the expert witnesses called by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Observations on the expert evidence provided in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Unfortunately, however, I found that the instructions provided to the Plaintiff’s expert in the present case appeared to have confused and/or conflated those issues which he was qualified to address as an expert witness with legal and factual issues which were in contention between the parties and meant for the court’s determination. In addition to being asked about “some of the steps or considerations that [the 1st Defendant], as an occupier, ought to have taken into account in the selection of [the 2nd Defendant] to carry out the A&amp;A works at No. 17”, the Plaintiff’s expert was also asked to give his opinion, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, on whether, “[o]n the facts of this case … [the 1st Defendant] had discharged their responsibilities in the appointment of [the 2nd Defendant]”, and whether the 1st Defendant had acted “properly or reasonably as occupiers in allowing [the 2nd Defendant] to carry out their work, bearing in mind the need to obtain the various approvals and before the necessary approvals were given”

This included ensuring that the A&amp;A works are only authorised and/or permitted after all necessary measures were taken to ensure the works would be safely carried out to ensure it was safe and not hazardous for its visitors or employees, while the A&amp;A works was going on”

He did not cite the basis for this somewhat expansive statement of general principle, and taken at face value, this appeared to be a statement that the 1st Defendant had a non-delegable duty to ensure that the A&amp;A works at No. 17 were carried out safely – which was precisely one of the key legal issues in contention.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Plaintiff’s expert also put forward in his report what appeared to be factual assumptions and/or factual conclusions, without explaining the basis for those assumptions or conclusions.

There was also no explanation as to how a tender exercise would have revealed that the 2nd Defendant’s “planned scope of work” was not “adequate” and thereby led to it not being selected as contractor.  As for ensuring “a competitive price”, I did not see how this was in any way relevant to the issue of whether the 1st Defendant had exercised reasonable care in the selection process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Much was also made by the Plaintiff’s expert of the fact that the 1st Defendant had obtained ISO 9001 certification. Indeed, he postulated that the 1st Defendant “should have carried out a more rigorous investigation of [the 2nd Defendant’s] experience and ability, especially in relation to whether [the 2nd Defendant] was competent to carry out the planned A&amp;A work”

</div>. Insofar as this statement appeared to suggest that a “more rigorous” standard of care should apply to the 1st Defendant on account of its ISO 9001 certification, no evidence or authority was produced to demonstrate that industry practice generally expected “more rigorous” standards of care from ISO-certified property owners, as compared to owners lacking such certification. In any event, the Plaintiff’s expert did not elaborate on why he found the 1st Defendant’s reliance on recommendations from other owners and on its own experience of earlier works by the 2nd Defendant to be unsound practice

I would add as an aside that the report of the 1st Defendant’s expert was not entirely free from some of the issues which tainted the report of the Plaintiff’s expert – including, for example, being asked to state his views on whether the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant were “liable for breach of [their respective] duties and obligations”

</div>. This appeared to me to be logical and sensible. Indeed, in a case like the present, where the neighbouring owner’s recommendations were based on works similar to those which the property owner intended to procure, and where the owner had the benefit of being able personally to inspect the works on the neighbour’s property, it seemed to me all the more reasonable for an owner engaged in selecting a contractor to have regard to the recommendations of a neighbouring owner. Similarly, from the perspective of logic and common sense, it appeared to me reasonable that such an owner should have regard to his own experience of earlier construction jobs done by the contractor on his property. Indeed, the 1st Defendant’s conduct in getting the 2nd Defendant to do two smaller jobs on its property before accepting the quotation for the A&amp;A works seemed to me to be prudent and sensible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I note that in cross-examination, the 1st Defendant’s expert was willing to agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel that as part of its selection process, the 1st Defendant “should check … whether the contractor is a licensed builder”

</div>. However, I did not find this concession to be of any assistance to the Plaintiff’s case. The assumption implicit in counsel’s questions to the 1st Defendant’s expert on this issue appeared to be that had the 1st Defendant carried out the check as counsel suggested, it would have discovered that the 2nd Defendant was unsuitable and would not have selected the latter as its contractor. With respect, this assumption was misconceived. To quote the High Court’s judgment on a similar issue in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> (at [45]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The issue is one of causation.

In other words, the appellants must show that the respondents would not have selected [the contractor] if they had exercised reasonable care in the selection process. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, the High Court pointed out (at [47]) that “there was no evidence” that the “further industry inquiries” suggested by the appellants “would have made any difference”. Esthetix (the contractor in that case) was a licensed builder; and no evidence had been led by the appellants to the effect that Esthetix had a bad safety record, that it had acquired a reputation for poor performance in the industry, or that there was otherwise anything irregular which would have been turned up in an inquiry that would have made a difference to the appointment.

Indeed, there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> evidence that the respondents were considering alternative contractors besides Esthetix.

This was (with respect) not particularly illuminating insofar as an assessment of viability of the Plaintiff’s cause of action was concerned.  In substance, the pleadings at paras 14.15–14.38 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) amounted to the assertion that vis-à-vis the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant bore a non-delegable duty to ensure that the 2nd Defendant exercised reasonable care in the execution of the A&amp;A works (or specifically, the hot works).

</div>
</div>, the CA provided in its judgment a comprehensive survey of the general principles governing this area of law. Of particular relevance were the following passages (at [19]–[24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 … [T]ortious liability is generally circumscribed by the “fundamental fault-based principle in the law of torts that liability lies with the party that has engaged in the tortious acts in question” … In this regard, Lord Sumption JSC, in delivering the leading judgment in the United Kingdom Supreme Court (“UKSC”) decision of <span class="font-italic">Woodland v Swimming Teachers Association</span> [2014] AC 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Woodland</span>”), held at [5]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law of negligence is generally fault-based. Generally speaking, a defendant is personally liable only <span class="font-italic">for doing negligently that which he does at all</span>, or for omissions which are in reality a negligent way of doing that which he does at all. The law does not in the ordinary course impose personal (as opposed to vicarious) liability for what <span class="font-italic">others </span>do or fail to do. This is because … a common law duty of care </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">does not usually demand compliance with a specific obligation. It is <span class="font-italic">only when an act is undertaken by a party</span> that a general duty arises to perform the act with reasonable care.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In other words, in the context of the tort of negligence, a person is generally only held liable for his <span class="font-italic">own</span> carelessness, and not for the carelessness of <span class="font-italic">others</span>. The reason for this is that the nature of the duty imposed by common law is merely to <span class="font-italic">do what</span> <span class="font-italic">you are required to do with reasonable care.</span> One implication of this is that if the performance of a particular task is delegated to another party, the party who was originally responsible for the performance of that task … would, ordinarily, not be subject to <span class="font-italic">any</span> tortious liability for the negligent performance of that task (since he did not personally perform the task).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 Vicarious liability stands, in a sense, as a derogation from this principle, or as a “true exception” to this … It permits the imputation of secondary tortious liability on an employer on the basis of its employee’s primary tortious liability … The employer is liable not because of its <span class="font-italic">own </span>negligence, but because of its <span class="font-italic">employee’s</span> negligence. The principles of vicarious liability, however, do not extend to imposing liability on employers for the negligence of their <span class="font-italic">independent contractors</span>. There is no basis in the doctrine of vicarious liability for suing an employer in tort for the negligence of its independent contractors …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 A <span class="font-italic">separate</span> legal basis for such a cause of action may, however, exist in the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non-delegable</span> <span class="font-italic">duties</span>. The liability incurred upon a breach of a non-delegable duty is <span class="font-italic">not vicarious</span><span class="font-italic"> …</span> Non-delegable duties are <span class="font-italic">personal</span> duties, the delegation of which will not enable the duty-bearer to escape tortious liability because the legal responsibility for the proper performance of the duty resides, in law, in the duty-bearer …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 From another perspective, it has been said that “the concept of personal duty departs from the basic principles of liability and negligence by substituting for the duty to take reasonable care a more stringent duty, <span class="font-italic">a duty to ensure that reasonable care is taken</span>” … Separately, Lord Sumption JSC described a non-delegable duty as a duty which “extends beyond being careful, to procuring the careful performance of work delegated to others” …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 It should be clarified that the concept of non-delegable duties does not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>import a higher or absolute standard of care. Referring to non-delegable duties, Gleeson CJ helpfully explained in <span class="font-italic">Lepore</span> at [26]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It also seems clear that the increased stringency to which he was referring lay, not in the extent of the responsibility undertaken (reasonable care for the safety of the pupils), but in the inability to discharge that responsibility by delegating the task of providing care to a third party or third parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 From the above, it is clear that where a party is subject to non-delegable duties, he will be held liable in tort if those duties are breached, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> he had non-negligently delegated the performance of those duties to an independent contractor, and it was the independent contractor who was negligent. In this sense, non-delegable duties create an exception to the rule that an employer cannot be liable for the negligence of its independent contractors …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>, the CA reaffirmed the two-stage test expounded in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> for determining whether a non-delegable duty would arise on a given set of facts, summarising the test as follows (at [82] and [84]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">82 … [A]t the first stage of this two-stage test, the claimant would have to satisfy the threshold requirement that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">either</span> his case fell within one of the established or recognised categories of non-delegable duties; <span class="font-italic">or</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) his case possessed all of the five defining features outlined by Lord Sumption JSC in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… namely:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The claimant was a patient or a child, or, for some other reason, was <span class="font-italic">especially vulnerable or dependent on the protection of the defendant to avoid the risk of injury</span>. Prisoners and residents in care homes were also mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Woodland</span> as likely examples in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) There was an antecedent relationship between the claimant and the defendant, independent of the negligent act or omission itself, which placed the claimant in the defendant’s actual custody, charge or care, <span class="font-italic">and</span> from which it was possible to <span class="font-italic">impute to the defendant the assumption of a positive duty to protect the claimant from harm, and not merely a duty to refrain from conduct which would foreseeably harm or injure the claimant</span>. In this regard, Lord Sumption JSC noted in <span class="font-italic">Woodland </span>that it was characteristic of such relationships that they involved an element of control by the defendant over the claimant, which would vary in intensity in different situations, but would “clearly [be] very substantial in the case of schoolchildren”…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) The claimant had no control over how the defendant chose to perform the obligations arising from the positive duty which it had assumed towards the claimant, that is to say, whether personally or through employees or third parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) The defendant had delegated to a third party some function that was an integral part of the positive duty which it had assumed towards the claimant; and at the time of the tortious conduct, the third party was exercising, for the purposes of the function thus delegated to him, the defendant’s custody, charge or care of the claimant and the element of control that went with it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) The third party had been negligent not in some collateral respect, but in the performance of the very function assumed by the defendant and delegated by the defendant to him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">84 [T]he second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> framework … would be triggered only upon the claimant satisfying the threshold requirement at the first stage. … [A]t the second stage, the court would additionally take into account the fairness and reasonableness of imposing a non-delegable duty of care on the defendant in the particular circumstances of the case as well as the relevant policy considerations in our local context …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>, the CA also reiterated with emphasis its observation in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> (at [38]) that non-delegable duties “‘should remain <span class="font-italic">exceptional</span>’… [T]he development of such duties should proceed ‘only “on the basis of a clear analogy to a recognised class [of non-delegable duties] and then only for compelling reasons of legal principle and policy”’ … This was because in many instances, it would be unrealistic or even impossible for the duty-bearer to fulfil the non-delegable duty in question, and this could lead to very artificial outcomes.” [emphasis in original] (at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In addition, in considering the first of the two approaches to the first-stage threshold requirement, whilst declining to come to a firm conclusion on whether the doctrine of ultra-hazardous acts should be recognised as an established category of non-delegable duties under Singapore law

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> The CA found it unnecessary to pronounce any firm conclusions on this issue because in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>, even assuming the doctrine of ultra-hazardous acts were recognised as part of Singapore law, the facts of that case could not possibly come within its ambit (at [89]). </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>, the CA reviewed the “trenchant criticism” which had been levelled against the doctrine (at [92]). Noting that “the doctrine of ultra-hazardous acts imposes an extremely stringent duty on the duty bearer”, the CA cautioned that “[f]or this reason, it should only be applied in very limited circumstances, namely, where an activity poses a material risk of causing exceptionally serious harm to others <span class="font-italic">even if</span> it is carried out with reasonable care. It is the <span class="font-italic">persistence</span> of such a risk <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the exercise of reasonable care which makes it fair, just and reasonable to hold the defendant liable for any negligence in the performance of the activity even if the negligent conduct was on the part of an independent contractor whom the defendant had engaged to carry out the activity.” [emphasis in original] (at [96]). Expanding further on this point, the CA held (at [108]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The doctrine of ultra-hazardous acts], if it is recognised as part of our law, should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances precisely because it can potentially provide a claimant with an exceptionally far-reaching remedy: a claimant whose case comes within the ambit of this doctrine is in a position to make a <span class="font-italic">principal</span> answer for the negligent acts and/or omissions of another <span class="font-italic">even if the latter is an independent contractor</span>. Indeed, it is the very nature of the exceptional setting in which such a remedy can be availed of that makes it appropriate to extend liability in that setting beyond the party who actually performs the activity in question to the principal for whom that activity is performed. Because that activity poses a material risk of causing exceptionally serious harm to innocent parties, it is appropriate that the net of liability be widened as far as it may reasonably be, so that a person who suffers harm from that activity is unlikely to be left without a real remedy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the general principles to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is instructive to examine how the CA applied the above reasoning to the facts of the <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> case itself. In that case, the appellants and the respondents owned neighbouring properties built along a slope, with the appellants’ house being the lower property (its ground floor being two metres below the appellants’ property). The appellants had engaged an independent contractor (“Esthetix”) to demolish the existing house on its property and to build another in its place. Whilst demolition works were being carried out by Esthetix on the respondents’ property, falling debris damaged the appellants’ property. The trial judge found that Esthetix had been negligent in failing to take a number of precautionary measures when executing the demolition works. On appeal, one of the issues canvassed before the High Court and the CA was whether the demolition works could be said to be ultra-hazardous, although the appellants’ counsel added a gloss to his arguments by stating that his case was that “only demolition <span class="font-italic">considered in the light of</span> (a) the proximity and (b) the relative elevations of the two houses” [emphasis in original] was ultra-hazardous (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (HC)</span> at [78]). The High Court dismissed the appellants’ arguments. In upholding the High Court’s decision, the CA stated that it was evident that the demolition works in this case “could not reasonably be said to be ultra-hazardous”; in particular, it noted the following points (at [97]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The appellants did not put forward anything to explain how the damage to their property ensued from a particular risk arising from the demolition works on the respondents’ property that remained substantial despite the exercise of reasonable care.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Demolition works are routinely done and there is nothing to suggest that despite the exercise of reasonable care, there remains a material risk of exceptionally serious harm arising from such works;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) This analysis does not change even though landed properties in Singapore tend to be located in close proximity to one another. That simply establishes the element of factual proximity and the foreseeability of harm being caused if reasonable care is not taken when demolition works are carried out. It does not in any way shed light on whether such works are “exceptionally dangerous whatever precautions are taken” … which was the central issue here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The above analysis applied with similar force in the present case. In the present case, even if one were to assume that the hot works – and in particular, the sparks arising from these works – created “a material risk of exceptionally serious harm”, nothing was put forward by the Plaintiff to suggest that such risk would remain <span class="font-italic">even if reasonable care were taken</span>. To quote from what the CA said in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>, the Plaintiff failed to put forward any material to explain how the loss and damage he had suffered “ensued from a particular risk arising from the [hot works] on the [1st Defendant’s] property that remained substantial despite the exercise of reasonable care” (at [97]). Here, as in the <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> case, the close proximity of No. 15 and No. 17 Link Road simply established the element of factual proximity and the foreseeability of harm being caused if reasonable care were not taken when the hot works were carried out”. This proximity did not in any way shed light on whether the hot works were “exceptionally dangerous <span class="font-italic">whatever precautions were taken</span>” [emphasis added]. In fact, if anything, much of the evidence of the Plaintiff’s expert and the closing submissions of the Plaintiff’s counsel were aimed at suggesting that had reasonable care been taken in the execution of the hot works (for example, by having a risk assessment done prior to the commencement of the hot works, by having “adequate” supervision of the 2nd Defendant’s workers, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), the risk of a fire occurring would have been minimised or eliminated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Accordingly, even on the assumption that the doctrine of ultra-hazardous acts is part of our law, the Plaintiff was unable to show that the doctrine applied on the facts of his case. In other words, applying the first of the two approaches to the threshold requirement for non-delegable duties, the Plaintiff could not show that his case fell within an established category of non-delegable duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I next considered whether, in the alternative, the Plaintiff’s case possessed the five defining features which would indicate the existence of a non-delegable duty. Again, it is instructive to examine how the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span> applied this second approach to the threshold requirement for non-delegable duties. In that case, the appellants argued that in electing to demolish their existing property and build a new house in its place, the respondents had “assumed responsibility” towards their neighbours, the appellants; that the appellants were especially vulnerable because their property was two metres lower than the respondents’, and they had no control over the demolition works carried out there; and that the respondents had control over the performance of the demolition works as they had control of the work site and the method of work, and could also make decisions on workplace safety and health. The CA rejected these arguments, holding at [103] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he relationship which the appellants described was essentially that which would ordinarily exist between neighbours owning adjoining plots of land. Under such a relationship, liability would arise if one of the neighbours acted negligently and caused foreseeable harm to the other. There was nothing distinctive about the facts here which demonstrated the particular kind of relationship described in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik </span>so as to found a non-delegable duty of care on the respondents’ part in respect of the demolition works carried out on their property. What was critical in this case was that unlike the relationship between a school and its students or that between a hospital and its patients, where it could meaningfully be said that the latter was in the “custody, charge or care” of the former, there was nothing to indicate that the appellants were in any sort of relationship of “special dependence” on or “particular vulnerability” in relation to the respondents so as to warrant the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the latter. Indeed, it could not be said that the respondents exercised any control over the appellants from which it was possible to impute to the respondents the assumption of a <span class="font-italic">positive duty to protect the appellant from harm</span> arising from the demolition works carried out on the respondents’ property, as opposed to merely a duty to refrain from conduct which could foreseeably cause harm to the appellants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Again, the above analysis applied with similar force in the present case. In the present case, the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendants owned adjoining properties. There was nothing distinctive about the present facts which could supply the basis for the particular kind of relationship described in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> and in <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span> as founding a non-delegable duty of care on the 1st Defendant’s part in respect of the hot works being done at No. 17. Certainly there was nothing on the facts which could provide a basis for saying that the Plaintiff was in a relationship of “special dependence” on or “particular vulnerability” to the 1st Defendant such as to justify the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the latter. Nor was there anything on the facts to justify a finding that the 1st Defendant had assumed a positive duty to protect the Plaintiff from harm arising from the hot works carried out at the wall between their respective backyards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this connection, I note that there was some suggestion in the Plaintiff’s AEIC that the 1st Defendant’s representative (by whom he appeared to be referring to Molly) had informed him during a visit to No 15 together with “the contractors’ boss” that “they [the 1st Defendant] would take the necessary precautions to ensure that the [g]oods stored in 15 Link Road were not affected in any way by the work which they intended to carry out”

</div> at No. 17. It was not entirely clear whether the Plaintiff was pitching these alleged remarks as amounting to an assumption by the 1st Defendant of a positive duty towards him to protect him from harm arising from the hot works. If he was, then the argument could not in my view possibly succeed. Firstly, it became clear from the Plaintiff’s own admissions in cross-examination that he could not actually recall such remarks being made to him, much less their being made by “the 1st Defendant’s representative”

</div>. Secondly, and in any event, even assuming that such remarks had been made by Molly to the Plaintiff, they could not provide any basis for finding that the 1st Defendant had assumed a positive duty to protect the Plaintiff from harm arising from the A&amp;A works or the hot works being done at No. 17. From the CA’s judgments in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>, it was clear that the issue of assumption of a positive duty by a defendant to protect a claimant from harm must be viewed in the context of an “<span class="font-italic">antecedent relationship</span>” between defendant and claimant, <span class="font-italic">independent of the negligent act or omission</span>, which “<span class="font-italic">placed the claimant in the defendant’s actual custody, charge or care</span>” [emphasis added] (at [82(b)(ii)] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng (CA)</span>). On the present facts, there was clearly no such antecedent relationship between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant in which the former could be said to have been placed in the latter’s “actual custody, charge or care”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In light of the above reasoning, I was satisfied that there was no basis for holding the 1st Defendant to be subject to a non-delegable duty of care in respect of the hot works carried out at the wall between No. 15 and No. 17.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Workplace Safety and Health Act imposes on the 1st Defendant non-delegable duties of care to the Plaintiff in respect of the A&amp;A works at No. 17</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It will be noted that in addition to the list of particulars of the 1st Defendant’s negligence enumerated at paras 14.16–14.38 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), it will be seen that at para 14.15, the Plaintiff also pleaded the following as one of the particulars of negligence: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Breach of duty under section 14A of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A) in failing, neglecting or refusing to take such measures as are necessary to ensure that the 2nd Defendant:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) had the necessary expertise and/or competence to carry out the construction works and/or hot works for which the contractor was engaged by the principal to do; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) had taken adequate safety measures in respect of the construction works and/or hot works’ machinery or equipment used by the 2nd Defendant or the latter’s employees to carry out the construction works and/or hot works</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In gist, para 14.15 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) reproduced most of the language of section 14A(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”).

Parsing these submissions, the only conclusion that made sense was that he was asserting that section 14A WSHA imposed on the 1st Defendant a non-delegable duty of care to the Plaintiff, to ensure that the A&amp;A works (and in particular, the hot works) at No. 17 were carried out with reasonable care.  In <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> (at [38]–[39]) and in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> (at [27]–[34]), the CA recognised that non-delegable duties could be imposed both by statute and at common law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In this connection, it must be pointed out that the existence of a statutory duty <span class="font-italic">per se</span> does not necessarily equate with the imposition of a common law duty of care.

Pointing out that “nothing in the express words of the BCA countenance the imputation of the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty”, the CA held that “the absence of any express statutory language to ground the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty was dispositive of the matter” (at [33]–[34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In the present case, the Plaintiff took it for granted that the 1st Defendant must be subject to the requirements stated in section 14A WSHA and therefore presented no arguments on the issue.

</div>, the definition of “principal” in section 4 WSHA is quite specific – it states that “principal”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… means a person who, in connection with any trade, business, profession or undertaking carried on by him, engages any other person otherwise than under a contract of service —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to supply any labour for gain or reward; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) to do any work for gain or reward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The 1st Defendant is in the trade or business of supplying electrical conduit pipes. It would put a very strained construction on the statutory definition of “principal” if – in relation to the A&amp;A works at No. 17 – one were to speak of the 1st Defendant engaging the 2nd Defendant “in connection with any trade, business, profession or undertaking carried on” by it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Even putting aside the above issues of construction and even assuming that the statutory duties in section 14A WSHA applied to the 1st Defendant, “[a] statutory duty does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> impose a concomitant duty of care at common law … even if it is phrased (as here) in terms of requiring the taking of ‘reasonable steps’ and ‘due diligence’” (see [87] above). The Plaintiff also needed to prove that the statute had clearly and expressly provided for a non-delegable duty of care of the nature and scope he was seeking to rely on. He failed to do so. To quote from the CA’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span>, therefore, “the absence of any express statutory language to ground the Proposed Non-Delegable Duty was dispositive of the matter” (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Nevertheless, to be fair to the Plaintiff, I followed the approach of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tiong Aik</span> in further considering whether the broader statutory scheme and object of the WSHA justified a broader view of the duties imposed under the WHSA.

</div> was a case in which the main contractor at a worksite (“JPW”) and the sub-contractor (“MA”) were held liable in negligence to the company (“Moh Seng”) from which a mobile crane had been hired for lifting works at the worksite. The crane was hired by another company (“Hup Hin”) who had a rental agreement with JPW to supply cranes to the worksite. The crane was damaged when it collapsed into a concealed manhole in the ground into which it had been driven. Both the Lifting Supervisor employed by MA and JPW’s Safety Officer had assured the crane driver that the ground was safe. This case did not assist Plaintiff because the CA’s decision – in holding JPW and MA liable in negligence for the damage to Moh Seng’s crane – was premised on the status of JPW and MA as the main contractor and the sub-contractor for the worksite. The CA held that the main objective of the WSHA was ensure a safer working environment at construction sites by strengthening the accountability of and impose responsibilities on parties such as the main contractor and sub-contractors, who had “operational control” of workplaces and thus primary responsibility in all areas of safety. Contractors and sub-contractors are parties whose negligence on construction sites has the most potential to result in fatal, or at least, costly consequences, given their well-placed abilities to foresee and be aware of the various possible mishaps that others without operational responsibilities and control may not be able to identify. In fact, the CA said, it was “very hard to think of situations where sufficient proximity to give rise to a common law duty of care [would] not be found to exist due to the control contractors and subcontractors have over the worksite and the on-going activities on it” (at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The CA’s judgment did not aid the Plaintiff in its contention that the 1st Defendant should be found vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent contractor or that the 1st Defendant should be subjected to a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safe performance of the A&amp;A works by the independent contractor.

</div>, the plaintiff was a construction worker who was injured at the worksite when a rebar cage collapsed onto him while it was being lifted for repositioning. The first defendant was the plaintiff’s employer and the sub-contractor engaged to carry out reinforcement, concreting and formwork at the worksite. The second defendant was the main contractor for that worksite. The High Court found that given the first defendant’s status as the plaintiff’s employer, there was clearly a relationship of proximity between them, and no reasons of policy which would suggest otherwise. The first defendant was found liable in negligence as the plaintiff had been asked to proceed with the lifting of the rebar cage when the first defendant, through its director and general supervisor Mr Chen, ought to have known that there was no lifting supervisor or safety supervisor on the scene. In any event, the first defendant was also vicariously liable for the negligence of its other employee, Mr Masum, who had been negligent in proceeding with the lifting of the rebar cage without supervision, in requesting the plaintiff to assist in the rigging of the said rebar cage when the latter was not trained or qualified in rigging, and in failing to ensure that the load of the rebar cage was properly rigged up before instructing the tower crane operator to lift the load. The High Court also found the second defendant liable because under the Crane Regulations, it was the second defendant who was responsible for establishing and implementing a lifting plan in accordance with safe and sound practice: lifting operations were to be conducted in accordance with the lifting plan; and compliance was to be ensured by a lifting supervisor – in this case, Mr Arasu, who was an employee of the second defendant’s. Evidence was given that despite the requirements of the Crane Regulations, there was little or no risk assessment or discussion within the lifting team or with the lifting supervisor about what was to be done each day. Evidence was also given that on the day of the accident, despite having been informed of the intended lifting of the rebar cage (which was a non-routine lift), Mr Arasu had failed to supervise the lifting operation and had also failed to instruct Mr Masum not to proceed until he could be present to supervise. Accordingly, the High Court found the second defendant to be negligent in that it had failed to take reasonably practicable measures which were necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons who might be affected by the lifting operations. The court also found the second defendant vicariously liable for Mr Arasu’s negligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Again, there was nothing in the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Chen Qiangshi</span> which could aid the Plaintiff in its contention that the 1st Defendant should be found vicariously liable for the negligence of the independent contractor or that 1st Defendant should be subjected to a non-delegable duty of care to ensure the safe performance of the A&amp;A works by the independent contractor.

In <span class="font-italic">Crown River Cruises Ltd v Kimbolton </span><span class="font-italic">Firewords Ltd and another</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Crown River Cruises</span>”) [1996] 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 533, the first defendants were the sub-contractors responsible for the organisation and execution of a firework display on the Thames river. Hot debris from the fireworks fell on one of the plaintiff’s barges which was then moored along the river. It appears that substantial portions of the barge ceiling were rotten, and that the loose slivers of timber would have been readily combustible. A fire thus started on board the plaintiff’s barge, which was not properly extinguished by the fire crew when it arrived, and which subsequently ignited into a serious fire, causing substantial damage to two of the plaintiff’s barges and some heat damage to a third. Potter J held the first defendant liable in negligence to the plaintiff. He also found it liable in nuisance, holding as follows (at 545):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where an activity creates a state of affairs which gives rise to risk of escape of physically dangerous or damaging material, such as water, gas or fire, then the law of nuisance is, and should be, available to give a remedy in respect of that state of affairs, albeit brief in duration. In my opinion, the holding of a firework display in a situation where it is inevitable that for 15-20 minutes debris, some of it hot and burning, will fall upon nearby property of a potentially flammable nature creates a nuisance actionable at the suit of a property owner who suffers damage as a result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Whilst the first defendant in <span class="font-italic">Crown River Cruises</span> was found liable both in negligence and nuisance, “negligence is not an essential element in nuisance … An occupier may incur liability for the emission of noxious fumes or noise although he has used the utmost care in building and using his premises”: <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Reid in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co Pty and another</span> [1967] AC 617 (“<span class="font-italic">The Wagon Mound (No. 2</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>”) at 639. Atkinson J summed up the position neatly in <span class="font-italic">Spicer and another v Smee</span> [1946] 1 All ER 489 (“<span class="font-italic">Spicer v Smee</span>”) at 493:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Liability for a nuisance may exist quite independently of [negligence].

</div>, the plaintiff and the defendant occupied adjoining premises. The defendant operated a container storage depot on its premises and had stacked multiple rows of 40-foot containers side by side, creating a large mono-block of containers (which was the standard practice). The two highest rows of containers were stacked up to seven tiers and were nearest the perimeter fence between the defendant’s land and the plaintiff’s. During a heavy thunderstorm, some of the defendant’s containers fell into the plaintiff’s land, damaging its property. The plaintiff sued the defendant, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, in nuisance. In allowing the claim, the High Court held that the mere storage of containers on the defendant’s premises could not be regarded as an unreasonable use of the premises for the purposes of ascertaining whether there was liability under the tort of nuisance. In the broad context of nuisance, the storage of containers itself attracted no liability. Liability would only attach if the stacking of the containers as done by the defendant was unsafe in the circumstances. The standard practice of stacking containers was a factor that had to be examined in the context of safety and the foreseeability of danger from mishaps arising from a collapse of the stacks. The High Court found that on a balance of probabilities, the collapse of the containers was caused by a sudden gust of strong wind during the thunderstorm; and that although the sudden gust of wind at the material time was in itself unusual, it was not so extraordinary as to constitute an event of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> when looked at in conjunction with the way the defendant had stacked its containers. Moreover, there were a number of precautions which could have been taken by the defendant and which would probably have precluded the collapse of the containers onto the plaintiff’s premises had they been taken – including avoiding having the containers stacked up to so many tiers, and stacking them perpendicularly to the fence instead of parallel to it (<span class="font-italic">Tesa Tape</span> at [16]–[20]). In short, the element of unreasonable use of the land could be established in that while storing containers on land in an industrial zone was not in itself a nuisance, placing the containers in a manner which made them foreseeably unsafe rendered the use of the land unreasonable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The High Court’s analysis of the foreseeability of the harm in <span class="font-italic">Tesa Tape</span> reflects another important limiting principle in any consideration of nuisance liability. In <span class="font-italic">Cambridge Water Co v Eastern Counties Leather </span><span class="font-italic">Plc</span> [1994] 2 AC 264 (“<span class="font-italic">Cambridge Water</span>”), the defendant was a leather manufacturer who had used a chlorinated solvent in degreasing pelts at its tannery, which was some 1.3 miles away from the plaintiff’s borehole where water was abstracted for domestic purposes. The solvent seeped into the ground below the defendant’s premises and was conveyed in percolating water in the direction of the borehole, subsequently rendering the water in the borehole unfit for human consumption. The plaintiff sued the defendant, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, in nuisance.  The House of Lords found that the plaintiff was unable to establish that pollution of their water supply by the solvent was in the circumstances foreseeable, and held that the defendant was not liable in nuisance, stating (at 299):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is still the law that the fact that the defendant has taken all reasonable care will not of itself exonerate him from liability, the relevant control mechanism being found within the principle of reasonable user. But it by no means follows that the defendant should be held liable for damage of a type which he could not reasonably foresee; and the development of the law of negligence in the past 60 years points strongly towards a requirement that such foreseeability should be a prerequisite of liability in damages for nuisance, as it is of liability in negligence. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The above principles have been accepted and followed by Singapore courts.

</div>, for example, the High Court noted (at [23]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Of importance to the issue of liability in private nuisance and negligence is the question whether the damage done was reasonably foreseeable. In [<span class="font-italic">The Wagon Mound (No. 2</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>], Lord Reid, approaching the case under the rubrics of both nuisance and negligence at p 644 said: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If it is clear that the reasonable man would have realised or foreseen and prevented the risk, then it must follow that the appellant is liable in damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Lastly, it must be noted that the “blanket exclusion of independent contractors” (see [49] above) which applies in any consideration of vicarious liability for the negligence of third parties does not apply in the tort of nuisance. Instead, the position is as summarised (below) in <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 20-72):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Nuisance created by independent contractor</span> Whether a person can be said to be a wrongdoer if the nuisance is created by his independent contractor depends on whether he could reasonably have foreseen that the work he had instructed the independent contractor to do was likely to result in a nuisance. In <span class="font-italic">Bower v Peate</span> [(1876) LR 1 QBD 321 (“<span class="font-italic">Bower v Peate</span>”)], Cockburn CJ said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“A man who orders work to be executed from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences to his neighbour must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented, is bound to see to the doing of that which is necessary to prevent the mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing someone else – whether it be the contractor employed to do the work from which the danger arises or some independent person – to do what is necessary to prevent the act he has ordered to be done from becoming wrongful.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 <span class="font-italic">Spicer v Smee</span> illustrates the operation of the above principles. In that case, the plaintiff and the defendant owned adjoining bungalows. The defendant had let out her bungalow, but prior to letting it out, had engaged a contractor to install electrical wiring in the bungalow. The plaintiff’s bungalow was destroyed by a fire which originated in the defendant’s bungalow. On the evidence, it was found that the fire in the defendant’s bungalow had resulted from defective electrical writing: the contractor engaged by the defendant to install the wiring had been negligent in leaving part of the live wire inadequately protected. The plaintiff sued the defendant in nuisance. The defendant argued that she could not be liable for the acts of her contractor. In rejecting her defence and allowing the plaintiff’s claim, Atkinson J – who referenced, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the judgment of Cockburn CJ in <span class="font-italic">Bower v Peate</span> – held (at 495) that “usually a man is not liable for the default of an independent contractor, but in the law of nuisance an exception exists”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the general principles to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Applying the above principles to the present case, I found that the 1st Defendant could reasonably have foreseen that the work it had instructed the 2nd Defendant to do was likely to result in a nuisance to its neighbour, the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 From the 2nd Defendant’s quotation of 25 February 2013, the 1st Defendant ought to have known that the A&amp;A works to its rear included the construction of a brick wall up to 2 metres in height and steel structural works

Moreover, whilst both Molly and Ross said that they had not been given a copy of the 2nd Defendant’s work schedule and that they had not been told anything about approval having to be obtained for hot works, I found that from ETS’s quotation of 25 September 2012, the 1st Defendant ought to have known that the works included some sort of hot works, as the ETS quotation expressly specified the “submission of plans to FSSD for Fire Safety approval”

In fact, the penultimate 5% of the total payment to be made to ETS was stated to be due upon the submission of such “Fire Safety” plans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Having regard to the above evidence, therefore, I found that the 1st Defendant ought to have known that the A&amp;A works it had commissioned would involve at some point hot works; and it ought as well to have known that such works, if not done in a safe manner, would cause fire damage to its neighbour’s property. In light of the evidence adduced, I also found that the element of unreasonable use of land was established. Whilst it might not be a nuisance <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to carry out A&amp;A works in one’s backyard, the execution of hot works at the perimeter fencing between the backyards of No. 15 and No. 17 in a manner which made such works foreseeably unsafe – in the presence of strong winds, in close proximity to the flammable mattresses stored at the backyard of No. 15, and in the absence of any supervision of the workers doing such works – rendered the use of the land unreasonable. As the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">OTF Aquarium </span>(at [23]), it is “clearly not a reasonable use of land to create or to continue a hazard which the owner or occupier knows or should know carries a foreseeable risk of damage to one’s neighbour.” Having regard to the principles stated in <span class="font-italic">Bower v Peate</span> and <span class="font-italic">Spicer v Smee</span> (as summarised in <span class="font-italic">Clerk v Lindsell</span> – see [114]–[115] above) on a land-owner’s liability for a nuisance created by an independent contractor, I also found that the fact that the fire hazard in this case was created by the 1st Defendant’s contractor (rather than directly by the 1st Defendant itself) did not absolve it of liability for the tort of nuisance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For the reasons set out above, I allowed the Plaintiff’s claim in nuisance against the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the 1st Defendant could be held liable for the Plaintiff’s damage and loss pursuant to the rule in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rylands v Fletcher</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In addition to his claims in negligence and nuisance, the Plaintiff also claimed that the 1st Defendant should be found liable pursuant to the rule in <span class="font-italic">Rylands v Fletcher</span> (“the Rule”).

As the 1st Defendant also acknowledged, however, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom has on more than one occasion rejected this path: see for example <span class="font-italic">Cambridge Water</span> and <span class="font-italic">Transco</span>. In the latter case, it was held that “the rule is, when properly understood, still part of English law and does comprise a useful and soundly based component of the law of tort as an aspect of the law of private nuisance. It derives from the use of land and covers the division of risk as between the owners of the land in question and other landowners” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough at [52] of <span class="font-italic">Transco</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Locally, too, our High Court has continued to apply the Rule as “part of the tort of nuisance”: see, for example, [8] in <span class="font-italic">Tesa Tape</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Tesa Tape</span>, it was held that the stacking of containers of such weight and size as those on the defendant’s premises – 7 tiers high – was “a non-natural use of the land, industrial or otherwise” (at [7]). The High Court also held that whilst a stack of containers “cannot escape into a neighbouring land any more than water can”, “[<span class="font-italic">e</span>]<span class="font-italic">scape</span> in the tort sense of <span class="font-italic">Rylands v Fletcher</span> has a nuance, which, when translated into common terminology, would mean a situation in which things on one’s land find themselves in the neighbouring land. The process by which they move or are moved from one property to the other constitutes an <span class="font-italic">escape</span> under the rules” [emphasis in original]. Citing from the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hale v Jennings Brothers</span> [1938] 1 All ER 579, the High Court noted (at [9]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The fundamental rule of the principle is that liability attaches because of the occupier of land bringing on to the land something which is likely to cause damage if it escapes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am of the opinion that damage and injury were foreseeable should the defendant’s containers fall onto the neighbouring land, and thus the collapse of the containers into the plaintiff’s premises attracted the application of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Rylands v Fletcher</span>.

</div>, for example, the first defendant was the occupier of second-floor office premises in which it had procured the installation of a water dispensing unit (“WDU”) by an independent contractor, the second defendant. The second defendant was also contracted to maintain the WDU. On the first defendant’s instructions, the second defendant installed the WDU in an area of the first defendant’s unit (“the WDU Area”) where the flooring was made of timber through which water could pass. It was not disputed that the maintenance contract and the second defendant’s maintenance service orders carried the disclaimer that the WDU should be installed at a wet pantry area – which the WDU Area was not. In installing the WDU, the second defendant fitted a water inlet hose to carry water to the WDU. Subsequently, the water inlet hose ruptured and water leaking from it seeped through the timber flooring of the second-floor unit into the plaintiff’s unit below. The plaintiff sued both defendants in negligence and nuisance and also pursuant to the Rule for the damage to his premises and to the paintings he had stored on his premises. Expert evidence led during the trial showed that the water inlet hose had a pre-existing fabrication defect in the form of two helical seam lines (“the Helical Line Feature”); further, the said hose was unsafe for use with a WDU because it was made of ester-based polyurethane which was susceptible to degradation when exposed to water (a process known as hydrolysis). Based on the expert’s evidence, the High Court found that both the Helical Line feature and the hydrolytic degradation would not have been discovered on a reasonable inspection. In holding the first defendant liable, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, under the Rule, the High Court held that “[a]lthough the use of a WDU, when viewed in the abstract, appears to be a natural use of land, it was not a natural use in the particular circumstances of this case. The placement of the WDU at the WDU Area, when combined with the Helical Line Feature and the gradual hydrolytic degradation of the Water Inlet Hose, made the use of <span class="font-italic">this</span> WDU a non-natural use of the Second Floor Unit” (at [76])

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> In this case, the High Court also found the first defendant liable in negligence because it found on the facts that the first defendant “went beyond simply engaging an independent contractor” (at [71]): it was the first defendant who had expressly instructed the second defendant to install the WDU at the WDU Area, despite there being a wet pantry area in its office premises and despite having been put on notice that the WDU should be installed in a wet pantry area.</div>

On the present facts, I found that the hot works which produced sparks or molten globules amounted to a non-natural use of the land. These sparks were something which in the “natural condition” of the land were “not in or upon it” (see [125] above). They constituted a dangerous “thing” which posed an exceptionally high risk to neighbouring property should they escape (see [126] above); and there was indisputably an escape of these sparks onto the Plaintiff’s property which caused a fire, wreaking extensive damage to the Plaintiff’s property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability in nuisance versus liability in negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I pause to note that Ross (the 1st Defendant’s chief executive) insisted throughout his testimony that they had entrusted the A&amp;A works to a contractor to whom they had paid good money and whose experience they had trusted: it was clear that Ross and no doubt Molly too baulked at the notion of the 1st Defendant being held liable when theirs were not the hands that had wielded the arc welding equipment. It might also be argued that if the 1st Defendant were not liable in negligence, then it must follow logically that they could not be held liable in nuisance or under the Rule. Such an argument would, however, be fallacious. It must be remembered that the essence of property-based torts such as nuisance is risk management in the use of one’s property. As Lord Hobhouse observed in <span class="font-italic">Transco</span> (at [55]), the law of private nuisance “reflects a social and economic utility”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The user of one piece of land is always liable to affect the users or owners of other pieces of land. An escape of water originating on the former, or an explosion, may devastate not only the land on which it originates but also adjoining and more distant properties. The damage caused may be very serious indeed both in physical and financial terms. There may be a serious risk that if the user of the land, the use of which creates the risk, does not take active and adequate steps to prevent escape, an escape may occur. The situation is entirely under his control: other landowners have no control. In such a situation, two types of solution might be adopted. One would be to restrict the liberty of the user of the land, the source of the risk, to make such use of his land as he chooses. The other is <span class="font-italic">to impose a strict liability on the landowner for the consequences of his exercising that liberty.</span> The rule [in <span class="font-italic">Rylands v Fletcher</span>] adopts the second type of solution as is clear from the language used by Blackburn J …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span>”), the learned authors explained the position in similar terms (at paras 09.080–09.083):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is possible to succeed in both nuisance and negligence actions on the same facts … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nonetheless, nuisance and negligence are different torts. First, there is a difference between the strict liability in nuisance and the concept of reasonable care in negligence … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The concept of unreasonable interference in nuisance actions involves balancing the factors relating to the defendant’s conduct as well as factors impinging on the infringement of the plaintiff’s right to the use and enjoyment of his land. In the tort of negligence, negligent conduct is assessed from the perspective of the standard expected of a reasonable man in the position of the defendant. Negligence is a defendant-oriented tort which hinges on the nature of the defendant’s conduct whilst nuisance is a plaintiff-oriented tort that focuses more on the plaintiff’s right to the use and enjoyment of his land.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nuisance is a land-based tort while negligence is not limited to claims related to the infringement of land-based rights, but also applies to physical damage to persons and chattels as well as economic loss. …</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether damages for personal injuries may be recovered from a defendant found liable in private nuisance and/or under the Rule</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The above commentary segues into my next point. Based on existing textbook and caselaw authorities, it would appear that damages for personal injuries are not recoverable in nuisance and/or under the Rule. As stated earlier (at [127]–[128]), the Rule has been treated by the English courts (and our local courts) as a sub-species of the tort of nuisance, and the tort of nuisance is a “tort based on the interference by one occupier of land with the right in or enjoyment of land by another occupier of land as such” (<span class="font-italic">Transco</span> at [9], <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Bingham). Accordingly, it has been held that a claim in nuisance and/or under the Rule “cannot include a claim for death or personal injury, since such a claim does not relate to any right in or enjoyment of land” (<span class="font-italic">Transco</span> at [9])
