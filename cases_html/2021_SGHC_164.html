This approach was further emphasised by Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar in explaining that it was not necessary for tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and cannabinol (“CBN”) to be included in the definition because the plant cannot be considered to be of the genus cannabis without their presence (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (10 November 1993) vol 61 at cols 928–929).

This explained why the accused’s signature was on the standard form, once before giving information, and again, after doing so. The information given by the accused was written onto the form itself. That the accused understood the conditional nature of the MDP notice was reflected both in his statements and in his repeated queries to Sgt(3) Fadhil prior to the second statement

The issue was whether Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) applied to these oral remarks that were made after the administration of the MDP notice. In my judgment, a distinction ought to be drawn between the delivery of the written MDP notice and subsequent oral iterations, for two reasons. First, an oral summation does not carry the same safeguards as the written MDP notice, which uses a precise form or words and warns specifically that nothing in it should be construed as a threat, inducement or promise. Secondly, Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) itself specifically stipulates that the accused be administered the MDP notice in <span class="font-italic">writing</span>. This requirement is itself a safeguard, to ensure that the precise form of words, and those only, be used. This suggests that oral variations of the MDP notice should not be used. Both reasons focus on fairness to the accused, and are therefore important. Accordingly, if Sgt(3) Fadhil had not made any comments about s 33A of the MDA, Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) would have continued to operate. However, once any question is asked about the conditional reduction in sentence and any explanation is to be made, out of fairness to the accused, the written notice itself should be administered. In the present case, this was not done. This would mean that Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) did not apply. As an objective matter, accused persons would want to avoid the death penalty and it follows that Sgt(3) Fadhil’s and SI Epeer’s responses to the accused could be construed objectively as an inducement under s 258(3) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Subjective effect of the oral remarks on the accused</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I come then to the subjective element, which only became relevant in this case because the statements fell outside the ambit of Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The accused testified that he had made the second contemporaneous statement on 25 July 2018 because of the oral inducement.

From these, they concluded that Pandian and the accused were acquainted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The fact that the accused and Pandian were friends was not disputed. The statements did not reveal any fact that was of significance to the accused’s case. In the present case, the <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span> obligations were not engaged, as the two supervisors were not material witnesses. The Prosecution stated that they disclosed the statements arising from their <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations because the accused alluded to Pandian in his evidence. Calling them to verify that the accused knew Pandian would not have added to the accused’s defence, and in any event, he was given the opportunity to do so but did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The prejudice that the accused relied upon was a loss in his ability to remain silent, while calling the two witnesses in his defence. The facts of the two cases relied upon by defence counsel in citing this prejudice were, however, entirely different to the case at hand. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wee Teong Boo</span> [2020] 2 SLR 533 the medical report that was disclosed late was relevant to the accused’s defence that he suffered from severe erectile dysfunction. This was material to a central point of his defence, that it would have been physically impossible for him to perform the act of rape. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Kin Choi v Public Prosecutor </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111 the accused faced a charge of murder for stabbing the victim in the neck at a restaurant. In establishing his defences of sudden fight, provocation and self-defence — on which he bore the burden of proof — the accused elected to remain silent, relying instead on the witnesses who were at the restaurant. These witnesses saw the fight as it unfolded and had personal knowledge as to the facts the accused was relying on for his defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In contrast, in the present case, the accused was required to establish a positive belief on his part, in order to rebut the s 18(2) presumption. For this he could not rely on the testimony of others who had no knowledge of his belief. There was nothing to indicate that the two co-workers had any personal knowledge as to his belief; neither was that specific assertion made. Their knowledge of his friendship with Pandian, which was not in any event disputed, bore no relevance to his belief regarding the contents of the five blocks he imported.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Substantive case and the issue of the accused’s knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Having dealt with the preliminary issues, I come to the substantive case. The physical elements of the offence of importation under s 7 of the MDA, and the accused’s possession and knowledge of the bundles were not disputed. The only question left then was whether the accused knew that he was carrying cannabis. This was the main factual contention of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution and Defence positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Prosecution argued that the accused’s first contemporaneous statement and Dr Phang’s report was proof of the accused’s actual knowledge,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  PWS at pp 14 and 30.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The primary case was that the accused had actual knowledge, and the alternative case was that he had not rebutted the s 18(2) presumption. However, the s 18(2) presumption is one that <span class="font-italic">presumes actual knowledge</span>. The alternative and primary case weres therefore the same in that <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> was the key factual basis in both. An alternative case is ordinarily used to make clear an alternative legal argument applicable on a <span class="font-italic">different factual basis</span> from the primary case. In <span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1087 (“<span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun</span>”) the Court of Appeal’s guidance was that where the Prosecution’s case rests on <span class="font-italic">several </span><span class="font-italic">distinct factual bases</span>, they must make it clear to the accused that they are also seeking a conviction on any one of those factual bases, if this objective is not already clear on its face: <span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun</span> at [85]. If they fail to clearly articulate their alternative cases, it cannot be relied upon to secure a conviction: <span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun</span> at [96]. Relevant to the present legal context are subsequent MDA cases where alternative cases were mentioned. For example, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) highlighted at [55] that procedural fairness required alternative cases where two distinct cases were being advanced against an accused person. Its context was, however, allegations of actual knowledge and wilful blindness. Because wilful blindness relies on the absence of actual knowledge, such primary and alternative positions would be premised on distinct, and contrary, factual bases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present case, in contrast, there is only <span class="font-italic">one</span> factual basis alleged: the <span class="font-italic">accused had actual knowledge</span> that the drugs were cannabis. In terms of <span class="font-italic">proof</span>, the Prosecution could rely on either direct evidence of knowledge or the s 18(2) presumption. These were <span class="font-italic">alternative modes of proving</span> their single case. It would be artificial to consider evidence as to the accused’s actual knowledge without consideration of the excuse he raised to rebut the s 18(2) presumption. Conversely, any evidence raised to rebut the s 18(2) presumption would need to be balanced against any evidence that indicated he had actual knowledge. The accused’s consistency and credibility were matters important to both methods of fulfilling the burden of proof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 More fundamentally, the legislature had enacted s 18(2) to mitigate the difficulties in proving knowledge, by putting the burden squarely on the accused once the limited circumstances of the section are triggered: see <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [68]–[69]. It is in keeping with statutory design for an analysis of the accused’s knowledge to start with s 18(2) of the MDA once its prerequisite conditions are met. If the s 18(2) presumption of actual knowledge is rebutted, then any alternative case (such as wilful blindness, which is premised on the lack of knowledge) could be considered, if there is one. While consideration of the s 18(2) presumption concerns a wholly different set of considerations from direct proof of actual knowledge (as mentioned by <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> at [29]), where the s 18(2) presumption has been rebutted, conversely, it is logically anomalous to find actual knowledge proved. Rather, if the s 18(2) presumption applies, the Prosecution remains entitled to press for a factual finding on the evidence available, aside from that relevant to the s 18(2) presumption, pointing to the accused’s knowledge. The frame of the analysis is pertinent to the assessment of the evidence. There was no prejudice to the accused in adopting this frame for analysis as the substantive issues in the case were not affected. I explained these points to the Prosecution and the Defence during the closing arguments, and neither party expressed further views or objections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In light of my views on statutory design, I start with the analysis on the s 18(2) presumption and deal first with the question whether the accused has rebutted the s 18(2) presumption on the balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the s 18(2) presumption to the case at hand </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The accused accepted that the burden was his to rebut the s 18(2) presumption. As highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [57], the accused person is only required to establish that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession. The key principles in approaching this query was distilled as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) As a matter of common sense and practical application, an accused person who seeks to rebut the s 18(2) presumption should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, and a claim that he simply did not know what he was carrying would not usually suffice: see <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) at [23(b)]; <span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>at [39].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The inquiry into the accused person’s state of mind or knowledge is ultimately a subjective inquiry (see <span class="font-italic">Masoud </span>([41(e)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [56]–[59]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) However, the court will assess the veracity of the accused person’s assertion as to his subjective state of mind against the objective facts and examine his actions and conduct relating to the item in question in that light in coming to a conclusion on the credibility of his assertion. This will invariably be a highly fact-specific inquiry, and the relevant considerations might include the physical nature, value and quantity of the item and any reward that was to be paid for transporting it (see <span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>at [40]; <span class="font-italic">Masoud </span>at [55]) or, for that matter, any amount that was to be collected upon delivering it. We raise these purely as examples to emphasise the overarching fact-sensitive nature of the inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Where an accused person’s defence is found to be patently and inherently incredible, then that will not impose any evidential burden for the Prosecution to rebut: see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Nabill</span>”) at [70] and [71]. To put it simply, a hopeless defence is no defence and raises nothing to rebut. In such circumstances, the court should find that the s 18(2) presumption remains unrebutted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) In assessing the evidence, the court should bear in mind the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, and the burden on the accused person should not be so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge (see <span class="font-italic">Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 499 at [2] and [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It was clear from (a) and (d), therefore, that the accused was required to articulate a <span class="font-italic">credible</span> <span class="font-italic">positive belief</span> that is incompatible with the knowledge that the thing he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession (and see also <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [60] to like effect).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 What was the accused’s belief, in this case? The accused's asserted belief, as framed by him, was that <span class="font-italic">he thought the Drugs were books, which would only attract a fine as a penalty</span>. The query into the credibility of this asserted belief, in line with (b) and (c), was a fact specific and subjective exercise which would include the physical nature, value and quantity of the item and any reward that was to be paid for transporting it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Credibility of the accused’s belief </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The accused himself found his version of events difficult to explain. In examination-in-chief, the accused testified that when Pandian gave him the items, he asked Pandian what they were and Pandian repeatedly told him that they were “five books and two food chocolate[s]”.

The fact that he had borrowed and returned loans from Pandian in the past did not assist his assertion that the RM5,000 was not a reward for the delivery of the Drugs. The accused was also not consistent in attempting to distance the delivery from its reward. In his first contemporaneous statement, when asked about Pandian, he stated that Pandian was the person who had asked him to deliver all the items, and that he would get RM5,000 for the delivery.

The accused was not able to explain these well. In respect of the early morning calls he initially agreed in the two weeks prior to the offence that he and Pandian had “no reason” to contact one another early in the morning; subsequently, when confronted with records of calls between him and Pandian, he said that Pandian might call him to wake him up in the morning.

That fact was clear from the accused’s testimony as to events of the day. Insofar as the Prosecution was attempting to prove that there was a consistent practice between Pandian and the accused to do deliveries, I did not agree. There was no independent evidence to show that the Accused had done jobs on other days. To the contrary, the accused’s first contemporaneous statement, which contents the Prosecution was asserting as accurate, recorded the accused stating that the occasion charged was his <span class="font-italic">first occasion</span> in transporting drugs (see “A12” at [77] below). The Prosecution's assertion that there was an established practice would be inconsistent with its assertion that the statement reflected the truth. Nevertheless, the accused’s inability to explain his dealings and close association with Pandian remained relevant as it did not lend any credence to his stated positive belief, which was his to establish. Whilst this inability to explain was not otherwise probative of his guilt, it was a clear weakness in his attempt to rebut the s 18(2) presumption.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the s 18(2) presumption in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the present case, the accused could have checked the bundles, but he did not.

</div> He had chosen not to check although he thought the books were illegal items that would attract a fine. In this respect, [67]–[69] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is pertinent:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 An accused person who is in a position to verify or ascertain the nature of what he is carrying but who chooses not to do so in the following types of situations may be described as being indifferent to the nature of what he is carrying:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) An accused person who is in fact wholly indifferent to what he is carrying.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) An accused person who knows that the thing he is carrying is a contraband item, but who does not care to find out what that contraband item is or is not.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) An accused person who identifies the drugs in his possession by some idiosyncratic or colloquial name, but who does not know what that means and does not bother to ascertain the meaning. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span>, the appellant referred to the drugs as “shine shine”, but did not know what that meant and did not take steps to inquire further (at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 In each of these cases, the accused person is <span class="font-italic">able </span>to verify or ascertain the nature of the thing he is carrying but <span class="font-italic">chooses </span>not to do so. The proper inference to be drawn in the circumstances is that he is in truth indifferent to what that thing is. The difference between these cases is, if anything, essentially one of degree. We consider that in these situations, the presumption of actual knowledge will generally be found not to have been rebutted because of the need to give full purposive effect to the policy underlying the MDA, which is to stem the threat that drug trafficking poses: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span> ([41(e)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [23]–[28], citing Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (20 November 1975) vol 34 at cols 1379–1381 (Mr Chua Sian Chin, Minister for Home Affairs and Education)… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 … The question for present purposes is whether Parliament intended for the s 18(2) presumption to be rebutted by an accused person whose defence is simply that he was indifferent to what he was carrying. In our judgment, the answer to this is in the negative because, as we have explained above, the s 18(2) presumption will only be rebutted where the accused person is able to establish that he <span class="font-italic">did not know the nature of the drugs </span>in his possession, and an accused person who is indifferent to the nature of the thing he is carrying cannot be said to have formed any view as to what the thing <span class="font-italic">is </span>or <span class="font-italic">is not </span>(see [65] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The accused’s articulated belief, that the blocks were books that were contraband but would attract a fine only, fell squarely within scenario (b) of [67]. In this context, he was not able to explain his RM5,000 reward, he was inconsistent in court, and his close contact with Pandian militated against any inability on his part to ascertain the true contents of the blocks. The s 18(2) presumption applied squarely to him and he was unable to rebut it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence aside from the s 18(2) presumption</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In this context, I return to the Prosecution’s primary contention that even without the s 18(2) presumption, the accused’s actual knowledge that he imported cannabis was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This aspect of their case relied on the accused’s statement at point of arrest and Dr Phang’s report.

</div> This aspect of the accused’s explanation was not credible for several reasons. First, SI Raziff first used the word <span class="font-italic">dadah</span> in relation to the cubes found in his motorcycle seat. If <span class="font-italic">dadah</span> were synonymous in his mind with <span class="font-italic">ganja</span>, he would have identified the cubes as <span class="font-italic">ganja</span>. But at Q2 he identified the cubes as food. When told at Q3 the items were controlled drugs, he answered that he did not know that they were drugs. SI Raziff had not used <span class="font-italic">dadah </span>in relation to the five blocks, which were seized in the garage at the point of search. There was no reason for him to connect <span class="font-italic">dadah</span> to <span class="font-italic">ganja</span> in his mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The accused furnished a second explanation, which was that once he was taken to the garage and shown the block of vegetable manner (as reflected in Q4 of the statement), he thought that they looked like “<span class="font-italic">ganja </span>leaves”, which he recognised from social media on his phone.

</div> Looking at the plain text of A4 in isolation, this was plausible. It had some consonance with his explanation in court that he knew the books were contraband items but not with his assertion that they attracted a fine only. First, in his answer at A4 he revealed that he used raincoat trousers to <span class="font-italic">hide</span> the block at Q4. The fact that he acknowledged he was hiding the block suggests he knew that the block contained something illegal. Second, his responses to later questions revealed a plan to deliver the five blocks and food for RM5,000. In context, it would have been logical for him to explain at A4 that he did not know the blocks contained <span class="font-italic">ganja</span> until that point, in the same way that he said he did not know that the cubes were drugs. This was not the only inference that could be drawn, however, and I return to this issue after a consideration of Dr Phang’s report, at [88] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Phang’s report </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Prosecution relied on the accused’s admissions recorded in Dr Phang’s report as corroboration of his first contemporaneous statement.

</div> In that case, “[a]nother piece of evidence pointing towards [the accused’s] knowledge of the true nature of the substance was the use of the word “heroin” in the psychiatric report”: at [79]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The later decision of <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 3 SLR 825 (“<span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span>”) suggests doubt, at [38]–[41] that an accused’s account to a psychiatrist could be treated as a statement under s 258(1) of the CPC. Whilst the comments made in <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu </span>were with regard to the specific issue of admissibility and in the present case the psychiatric report was admitted for different reasons, the views expressed in [38]–[41] are applicable. Police statements are admissible under s 258 of the CPC because they are recorded in a specific manner provided for under ss 21 and 22 of the CPC. Statements to psychiatrists do not have the same safeguards and are admitted for the specific purpose of obtaining the psychiatrist’s opinion. The details of interviews are important to explain the basis of the psychiatrist’s opinion and should be considered in their proper context. Interviews recorded by way of history by psychiatrists assessing soundness of mind should not carry the same weight and would not be as reliable as admissions made in statements to the police. Notwithstanding, such statements could be used in cross-examination in the assessment of an accused’s credibility and as a reference point to test the evidence. In my view, such an approach is not inconsistent with that of the court in <span class="font-italic">Saridewi</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this context, I deal with the Prosecution’s cross-examination of the accused on paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report.

The accused stated that Pandian told him the 'job' was "in relation to stuff...something, substance, which is unlawful.

He further stated that "I did not say it was ganja but I thought it looked like ganja", having previously seen the drug on WhatsApp, on my phone".

</div> This indicated that he did not definitively know that the blocks were <span class="font-italic">ganja</span>. Conversely, this could support the accused’s evidence in court regarding A4 of his first contemporaneous statement, that he only realised the blocks were cannabis <span class="font-italic">after</span> he was shown them. Thus, it was not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused possessed specific knowledge of the nature of the drug at the point of importation. Rather, it remained plausible that he harboured a suspicion prior to the importation that the blocks contained cannabis, and it was only later confirmed when he was shown the blocks in daylight. It was possible that he readily identified the cannabis at that point because, as recorded at paragraph 12 of Dr Phang’s report, he wished to cooperate.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on accused’s knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The accused’s first contemporaneous statement contained an admission that he was aware that the Drugs were cannabis. The issue was whether his answer referred to a knowledge at the time of his importation of the blocks, or only upon seeing the blocks in daylight at the garage as he contended at trial. Dr Phang’s record of his interview with the accused, when read as a whole and in context, did not point to either alternative. The accused’s inconsistencies and lack of credibility, while relevant to the issue of the s 18(2) presumption, were of a general nature. When considered aside from the s 18(2) presumption, they were not probative of his knowledge of the nature of the drug in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the light of the Prosecution’s burden of proof, I did not think that actual knowledge could be established in this case on the basis of the accused’s contemporaneous statement without the benefit of the s 18(2) presumption. But the accused’s knowledge that the blocks were drugs put him squarely into scenarios (b) and (c) articulated by the Court of Appeal at <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [67]: see [74] above. The statement was an additional piece of evidence that pointed away from the accused being able to rebut the s 18(2) presumption. I therefore convicted the accused on the charge brought against him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Coming to the issue of sentence, the accused’s actions in the present case were limited to those of transporting cannabis, and associated preparatory acts for the transporting. The Prosecution agreed that the accused was a courier and further tendered a certificate of substantive assistance. Both requirements of s 33B(2) of the MDA were therefore met. In such circumstances, s 33B(1) of the MDA allows the imposition of a life sentence in the stead of a death penalty, with a mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane where a life term was imposed. I exercised my discretion to sentence the accused to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The life term was backdated to his date of remand, 26 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sruthi Boppana and Gregory Gan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">N K Rajarh (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) and Sureshan s/o T Kulasingam (Sureshan LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
