<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By a letter dated 29 January 2007, the
                    plaintiff, Top Ten Entertainment Pte Ltd, lodged a complaint with the defendant,
                    The Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”). In the
                    complaint, the plaintiff alleged that Mr Andre Arul
                    (“Mr Arul”), an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court
                    of Singapore practicing at Messrs Arul Chew &amp; Partners, had: (a) rendered
                    exorbitant bills of costs contrary to agreed costs at $25,000; (b) received
                    strict instructions from the plaintiff not to transfer any money from the
                    client’s account; and (c) in defiance of those specific instructions,
                    transferred $54,909 and $32,000 respectively from the client’s account to
                    satisfy the solicitor’s bills of costs which were disputed by the
                    plaintiff. This same complaint was re-lodged on 19 April 2007 (“the
                    Complaint”) because the Law Society required the appropriate letter of
                    authority from the plaintiff, being a body corporate, to authorise its managing
                    director, Mr Peter Bader (“Mr Bader”), to lodge the
                    complaint on its behalf. In connection with the Complaint, Mr Bader swore
                    two statutory declarations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On or about 7 May 2007, a Review Committee
                    was formed to review the Complaint. The Review Committee recommended that the
                    Complaint be referred to an Inquiry Committee to look into the merits of the
                    Complaint pursuant to s 85(10) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161,
                    2001 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). Based on the terms of reference
                    provided by the Review Committee, the Inquiry Committee was constituted to
                    inquire into the Complaint on or about 7 January 2008. On or about
                    10 June 2008, the Inquiry Committee concluded its inquiry and rendered its
                    findings in a written report to the Council of the Law Society. The Inquiry
                    Committee recommended the Council of the Law Society to: (a) dismiss the
                    Complaint lodged by the plaintiff as there was no merit to the Complaint; but
                    (b) impose a fine of $500 on Mr Arul for breaching the Law Society’s
                    practice directions in relation to Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the Legal Profession
                    (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 5, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (the “Solicitors’ Accounts Rules”), which required a
                    solicitor to give adequate notice to his client of any transfer of moneys from a
                    client’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The findings of the Inquiry Committee were
                    accepted and adopted by the Council of the Law Society. For the reasons stated
                    in the Inquiry Committee’s report, the Council of the Law Society decided
                    that a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal was unnecessary and
                    dismissed the Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On or about 11 August 2008, the plaintiff
                    filed Originating Summons No 1048 of 2008/T (“OS 1048”) to
                    seek judicial review of the decision of the Council of the Law Society to
                    dismiss its Complaint against Mr Arul under s 96 of the
                LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the conclusion of the adjourned hearing on
                    23 October 2009, the court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     affirmed the Inquiry
                        Committee’s finding that there was no agreement on fees between the
                        plaintiff and Mr Arul;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     directed the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for
                        the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal to look into two matters, namely,
                        to investigate whether Mr Arul, as solicitor for the plaintiff, was in
                        breach:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       of his professional duties
                            by disobeying the plaintiff’s instructions contained in two
                            e-mails dated 7 July 2006 and 24 August 2006 respectively, by
                            placing a sum of $114,440.97 on 7 August 2006 into the
                            client’s account with Messrs Arul Chew &amp; Partners and also
                            transferring moneys in payment of the solicitor’s
                        fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_5-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       of
                            the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules by placing a sum of $10,000 which
                            he received on 11 August 2006 into his firm’s office account
                            instead of the client’s account with Messrs Arul Chew &amp;
                            Partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     ordered the Law Society to pay 50% of the plaintiff’s costs of
                        the proceedings in OS 1048.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       By a letter dated 29 October 2009, the Law
                    Society’s counsel, Mr Mohan Pillay (“Mr Pillay”),
                    wrote in to request for further arguments in respect of the costs order. By a
                    letter dated 2 November 2009, the plaintiff’s solicitors objected to
                    Mr Pillay’s request. The court declined to hear further arguments and
                    the parties were duly notified of its decision by a letter dated
                    11 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By Summons No 6001 of 2009/B, the Law
                    Society applied under s 34(2)(b) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal
                    against the order requiring the Law Society to pay 50% of the plaintiff’s
                    costs in OS 1048. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was granted on
                    21 January 2010. On 18 February 2010, the Law Society filed its Notice
                    of Appeal against that part of the order made on 23 October 2009 requiring
                    the Law Society to pay 50% of the plaintiff’s costs in OS
                1048.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the court can order costs against the Law Society</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The court’s power in judicial review
                    proceedings brought under s 96(1) of the LPA is set out in s 96(4),
                    which states as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    At the hearing of
                            the application, the Judge may make an order —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    affirming the determination of the Council;
                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    directing the Society to apply to the Chief
                                Justice for the appointment of a Disciplinary
                            Tribunal,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and <em>such order for the payment of costs as may be
                            just</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, s 96(4) of the LPA expressly provides that the court has
                    the discretion to make such an order for the payment of costs <em>to achieve the ends of justice</em>. The provision does not provide
                    any special considerations that the court must take into account in making the
                    cost order. Simply put, the language of s 96(4) is in plain and unfettered
                    terms, and the power is exercisable against the Law Society if it is just to do
                    so in the present circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I will now turn to consider, generally, the
                    court’s approach in the exercise of its discretion as to costs in cases
                    involving disciplinary proceedings which are appealed to or reviewed by the
                    higher courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     First, I bear in mind that the overall aim of
                    the discretionary power as to costs is to achieve the fairest allocation of
                    costs in the circumstances of the case at hand: see <em>Re
                        Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 95
                        (“<em>Re Shankar Alan</em>”) at [17];
                        <em>Soon Peng Yam v Maimon bte Ahmad</em> [1995]
                    1 SLR(R) 279 at [31]. In a civil case, this would ordinarily mean that
                    costs will follow the event. The successful party will therefore receive his
                    costs for the action: see <em>Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrea
                        G</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 501 at [24]. In <em>Lim Teng Ee Joyce v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 709, Chao Hick Tin JA observed, in relation to a suit
                    brought against the Singapore Medical Council, that the same principle would
                    apply to disciplinary proceedings, for the following reason (at [17] and
                    [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Another established rule on costs is that costs
                            should always follow the event unless the circumstances of the case
                            warrant some other order: see <em>Elgindata Ltd
                                (No 2)</em> [1992] 1 WLR 1207 at 1214
                                ("<em>Elgindata</em>"). In <em>Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrea G</em> this court set aside
                            that part of the trial judge's order which deprived the successful
                            appellant of half his costs. There, this court noted (at [23]) that the
                            judge below had "disregarded the principle that a successful party who
                            had acted neither improperly nor unreasonably ought not to be deprived
                            of any part of his costs".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    We are unable to see why the above principles on
                            costs in normal civil proceedings should not apply to the disciplinary
                            process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The principle, that cost follows the event, is
                    one (important) consideration which guides the court in the exercise of its
                    discretion. However, this principle will have to be considered by the court
                    alongside a multitude of other possible factors in reaching a just decision.
                    Each case falls to be determined on its own facts. For example, in <em>Chua Ah Beng v Commissioner for Labour</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 945 (“<em>Chua Ah
                    Beng</em>”), the court summarised the outcome of the proceedings,
                    as follows (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff has succeeded where the construction of s 33(3) of the
                        WCA is concerned but has failed in his application to obtain the remedies
                        prayed for. The points raised by all parties are important and the arguments
                        put forward have been fair. I also have no doubt that the position taken by
                        the Commissioner for Labour in this case is taken in good faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Given these circumstances, the court in
                        <em>Chua Ah Beng</em> made no order as to costs.
                    However, <em>Chua Ah Beng</em> does not therefore stand for
                    the general proposition that no order as to costs would be made if both
                    litigants acted in good faith and raised only fair points. The unique factual
                    circumstances of that case also have to be taken into account. As Menon JC
                    observed in <em>Re Shankar Alan</em> at [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, that case [ie, <em>Chua Ah Beng</em>]
                        also is distinguishable. The facts before Tay JC were that the
                        plaintiff there had succeeded in some respects but failed in others
                            <em>particularly in relation to securing the reliefs he
                            sought</em>. In that context, the court considered it relevant
                        that fair points had been raised and that positions had been taken in good
                        faith, and therefore held there should be no order as to costs. However,
                            <em>Chua Ah Beng</em> does not stand for the
                        general proposition that in the sort of proceedings that Mr Yim
                        referred to there should be no order as to costs if both litigants act in
                        good faith and raise only fair points.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree with Menon JC’s observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Furthermore, I would observe that costs have
                    been ordered against the Law Society in proceedings brought under the LPA. In
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong
                        Lawrence</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 825, a written complaint of
                    dishonourable and unprofessional conduct against the respondent for making
                    unfounded allegations in open court was lodged with the Law Society of
                    Singapore. An inquiry committee was appointed to investigate the matter and duly
                    made its report. Relying upon this report, the Council of the Law Society
                    determined under s 88 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217,
                    1970 Rev Ed) (now s 87(1) of 2009 Rev Ed) that the respondent
                    should be ordered to pay a penalty and imposed a $1,000 penalty upon him. The
                    respondent applied to the High Court to have this penalty set aside under
                    s 95 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Rev Ed) (now
                    s 95 of 2009 Rev Ed) on the grounds that the Law Society had no
                    jurisdiction over him and that the complaint was in any case unfounded. He
                    succeeded in his application at the High Court before Sinnathuray J (see
                        <em>Ang Boon Kong Lawrence v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 783  ) and the Law
                    Society appealed to the Court of Appeal against the order setting aside the
                    penalty. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Law Society's appeal with costs, but
                    regrettably, did not discuss the issue of costs in detail or address the public
                    policy considerations in awarding costs against the Law Society.
                    Sinnathuray J in the High Court held that the Inquiry Committee did not
                    have jurisdiction and it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that there was no
                    evidence whatsoever to support the findings of the Inquiry Committee. For those
                    reasons, Sinnathuray J held that costs had to follow the event, noting that
                    (at [11] and [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    The learned Attorney-General has also asked for
                            costs of these proceedings and the costs of his appearance for
                            Mr Lawrence Ang before the Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    I think costs must follow the event. <em>These proceedings should not have been
                            necessary</em>. The Law Society will pay the costs of these
                            proceedings, including the costs of the Attorney-General before the
                            Council when Mr Lawrence Ang was called upon to appear before the
                            Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Re Lim Chor
                        Pee</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 117, the respondent was ordered to
                    show cause under the LPA. The court found that the six charges had not been
                    proven beyond a reasonable doubt and discharged the order <em>nisi</em> to show cause. As for costs, the court held that (at
                    [103]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In this case, the Law Society had framed the charges in an extremely
                        broad manner, and in respect of the first charge and the seventh alternative
                        charge they are outside the scope of the information referred by the
                        Attorney-General. In respect of most of the charges we found the evidence
                        most inadequate. For these reasons and taking into account all other
                        relevant circumstances, we are of the opinion that in this case the
                        respondent [i.e., Mr Lim Chor Pee] should have his costs of the hearing
                        before us. We accordingly so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is, therefore, evident that in cases
                    involving appeals or reviews to the higher courts, the court’s discretion
                    to award costs against the Law Society under the LPA is unfettered. Before I set
                    out my reasons for awarding 50% of the costs against the Law Society, I will
                    turn to consider the two arguments that were raised by counsel for the Law
                    Society (“Mr Pillay”) to support his position that no costs
                    should have been ordered against the Law Society in the present
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law Society’s position on costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mr Pillay who appeared on behalf of the
                    Law Society objected to the costs order on two main grounds. First,
                    Mr Pillay contended that the present proceedings related to a
                    “public interest” litigation such that no costs should be ordered
                    against the Law Society who did not choose to initiate or defend the litigation.
                    Mr Pillay cited R <em>(Corner House Research) v
                        Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</em> [2005]
                    1 WLR 2600 (“<em>Corner House
                        Research</em>”) to support his contention.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Second, Mr Pillay submitted that the Law Society was not a civil litigant
                    and should, therefore, not be “penalized” on costs when it came to
                    fulfilling its statutory function, citing <em>Baxendale-Walker v
                        Law Society</em> [2008] 1 WLR 426 (“<em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In short, he contends that the
                    Law Society should be treated, in disciplinary-related proceedings under the
                    LPA, differently from a party to ordinary civil litigation. The effect of
                    Mr Pillay’s submission was that the principle that costs should
                    ordinarily follow the event did not and ought not to apply to the Law Society in
                    the present circumstances. I shall now consider in turn the two distinctive
                    features raised by Mr Pillay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there any public interest element present in opposing OS
                1048</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, the Law Society did not,
                    in my view, further the public interest by opposing or resisting a challenge of
                    its decision. Whilst the Council of the Law Society in coming to its decision
                    having considered the report of the Inquiry Committee was exercising a public
                    function, as with most public functions, the decision is subject to review by
                    the courts and this is expressly provided for under s 96 of the LPA. In
                    proceedings brought under s 96 of the LPA, it would be in the public
                    interest for the Law Society to lay before the court its full reasons for its
                    decision. However, it does not follow that it would be in the public interest
                    for the Law Society to strongly defend its decision in the face of any
                    challenge, regardless of whether it was legitimate or reasonable for it to do so
                    under s 96 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In any case, no legal question of public
                    interest was raised in OS 1048. I agreed with Mr Bajwa that <em>Corner House Research</em> is distinguishable and did not
                    assist the Law Society. In that case, Corner House Research applied for judicial
                    review of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry’s decision to
                    amend the procedures of the Export Credits Guarantee Department ("ECGD") of the
                    Department of Trade and Industry and the ECGD's standard forms relating to
                    bribery, corruption and money laundering and, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, applied for a protective costs order. Lord Phillips MR
                    discussed the notion of public interest in the context of the grant of a
                    protective costs order. Lord Phillips MR (at [69]–[70]) held that one
                    important difference between public law litigation and private law civil and
                    family litigation was that there was a public interest in the elucidation of
                    public law by the higher courts in addition to the interests of the individual
                    parties. Another case which deals with public interest in the outcome of
                    litigation is <em>Oshlack v Richmond River Council</em>
                    (1998) 193 CLR 72. There, the High Court of Australia held that there
                    was public interest in the outcome of the litigation because a significant
                    number of members of the public shared the appellant's stance to uphold
                    environmental law and the preservation of endangered fauna. On the facts of the
                    present case, it is clear to me that <em>no</em> such
                    important question of <em>public interest</em> had
                    arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Law Society appear in its capacity as a regulator of the
                legal profession</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I now turn to the decision of <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em>. Mr Pillay urged the court to
                    follow the English position which recognises the difference in principles
                    relating to costs in proceedings brought in the public interest in the exercise
                    of regulatory functions on the one hand, from those which applied to ordinary
                    civil litigation. In that case, the Court of Appeal recognised that the Law
                    Society of England and Wales performed an important function as a regulator
                    exercising a public function.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Notably, the facts in OS 1048, where the Law
                    Society here is defending its decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    Complaint, should be contrasted with the English position, where the Law Society
                    of England and Wales is responsible for instituting proceedings against errant
                    lawyers. For a better appreciation of the differences between the two regimes,
                    it is necessary to understand the procedure for disciplinary proceedings in the
                    UK which I summarise as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal
                    (“the Tribunal”) is an independent statutory tribunal constituted
                    under s 46 of the UK Solicitors Act 1974 (c 47) (the “Solicitors
                    Act”). It is independent of the Law Society of England and Wales although
                    it is largely funded by the Law Society of England and Wales. The Tribunal
                    adjudicates upon alleged breaches of rules or code of professional conduct which
                    are designed to protect the public and maintain the reputation of the
                    solicitors' profession for honesty, probity, trustworthiness, independence and
                    integrity. The Tribunal has power to strike off a solicitor from the Roll,
                    suspend from practice, fine or reprimand (see s 47(2) of the Solicitors
                    Act) and award costs to either side (see s 47(2)(i) of the Solicitors
                    Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is the practice of the Tribunal to decide
                    if the allegations have been substantiated. At the conclusion of the hearing,
                    the Tribunal's written order is made available as soon as is practicable (see
                    Rule 16(5) of the UK Solicitors (Disciplinary Proceedings) Rules 2007). The
                    Tribunal's decisions can be appealed to the Master of the Rolls or the High
                    Court depending on the circumstances. Under s 49(4) of the Solicitors Act,
                    the Master of the Rolls or the High Court (as the case may be) has the power to
                    make such order on appeal as they may think fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Solicitors Regulation Authority initiates
                    over 90% of the cases dealt with by the Tribunal. Whilst it is open to any
                    person to make an application to the Tribunal directly, it is more common for a
                    complainant to first approach the Legal Complaints Service for a matter to be
                    investigated. Where an application is made directly to the Tribunal by a member
                    of the public, the Tribunal may refer it to the appropriate body to conduct an
                    investigation and/or pursue the complainant's original application on his
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In contrast, under Singapore law, any
                    complaint of the conduct of an advocate and solicitor has to be made to the Law
                    Society in writing (s 85(1) of the LPA). If the complaint is made within
                    the prescribed time, the Council of the Law Society has to refer it to the
                    Chairman of the Inquiry Panel under s 85(1A) of the LPA. The Chairman of
                    the Inquiry Panel will within 2 weeks, constitute a Review Committee
                    (s s85(6) of the LPA) and this Review Committee will complete its review
                    within 4 weeks of its constitution and direct the Council of the Law Society to
                    dismiss the matter or refer the matter back to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel
                    (s 85(8) of the LPA). Under s 85(9) of the LPA, the Council of the Law
                    Society shall within 7 days of receiving the direction to dismiss the matter,
                    give effect to the direction. Where a person has made a complaint to the Law
                    Society and the Council of the Law Society has determined that there is no
                    sufficient cause for a formal investigation but the advocate and solicitor
                    concerned should pay a penalty, the complainant may apply to a Judge within 14
                    days of being notified of the Council’s determination (s 96(1) of the
                    LPA). At the hearing, the Judge may make such order for the payment of costs as
                    may be just (s 96(4) of the LPA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Returning to the decision of <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em>, the Law Society of England and
                    Wales in that case initiated disciplinary proceedings against the solicitor at
                    the Tribunal. One of the two allegations of conduct unbefitting a solicitor was
                    not proved but the second was admitted, and the Tribunal found the solicitor
                    guilty of unbefitting conduct and suspended him from practice for three years.
                    Pursuant to section 47(2) of the Solicitors Act 1974, the Tribunal made an order
                    that the Law Society of England and Wales pay 30% of the solicitor's costs of
                    the proceedings (since the first allegation had not been proved and a greater
                    proportion of the solicitor's costs had been incurred in defending that
                    allegation). The solicitor appealed to the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench
                    Division against the sentence of suspension from practice. The Law Society of
                    England and Wales cross-appealed against the costs order. The Divisional Court
                    allowed the cross-appeal and ordered the solicitor to pay 60% of the
                    former’s costs instead, holding that the principles relating to costs in
                    proceedings brought in the public interest in the exercise of regulatory
                    functions differed from those which applied to ordinary civil
                litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Baxendale-Walker v The
                        Law Society</em> [2006] 3 All ER 675, Moses LJ (sitting
                    with Burnton J in the Divisional Court) held that where a regulator brings
                    disciplinary proceedings in the public interest and in the exercise of a public
                    function, which it is required to perform, it is different from private civil
                    litigation as follows (at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question thus arises as to whether the order that the Law Society
                        should pay a proportion of the appellant's costs and that no costs should be
                        paid by the appellant was correct, as a matter of law. The principles, in
                        relation to an award of costs against a disciplinary body, were not in
                        dispute. A regulator brings proceedings in the public interest in the
                        exercise of a public function which it is required to perform. In those
                        circumstances the principles applicable to an award of costs differ from
                        those in relation to private civil litigation. Absent dishonesty or a lack
                        of good faith, a costs order should not be made against such a regulator
                        unless there is good reason to do so. That reason must be more than that the
                        other party has succeeded. In considering an award of costs against a public
                        regulator the court must consider on the one hand the financial prejudice to
                        the particular complainant, weighed against the need to encourage public
                        bodies to exercise their public function of making reasonable and sound
                        decisions without fear of exposure to undue financial prejudice, if the
                        decision is successfully challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the context of the institution of
                    disciplinary proceedings against a solicitor, Moses LJ also noted (at [50])
                    in relation to costs awards that the Tribunal might, in some circumstances,
                    reflect the failure of one of the allegations by making an order that the
                    unsuccessful solicitor should not have to pay all of the costs but that was a
                    far cry from saying that he should be paid some of his costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Court of Appeal in <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em> in dismissing the appeal held, in relation
                    to the public function of the Law Society of England and Wales, that (at
                    [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An order that the Law Society itself should pay the costs of another party
                        to disciplinary proceedings is neither prohibited nor expressly discouraged
                        by section 47(2)(i). That said, however, it is self-evident that when
                        the Law Society is addressing the question whether to investigate possible
                        professional misconduct, or whether there is sufficient evidence to justify
                        a formal complaint to the tribunal, the ambit of its responsibility is far
                        greater than it would be for a litigant deciding whether to bring civil
                        proceedings. Disciplinary proceedings supervise the proper discharge by
                        solicitors of their professional obligations, and guard the public interest,
                        as the judgment in Bolton’s case [1994] 1 WLR 512 makes
                        clear, by ensuring that high professional standards are maintained, and,
                        when necessary, vindicated. Although, as Mr Stewart maintained, it is
                        true that the Law Society is not obliged to bring disciplinary proceedings,
                        if it is to perform these functions and safeguard standards, the tribunal is
                        dependent on the Law Society to bring properly justified complaints of
                        professional misconduct to its attention. Accordingly, the Law Society has
                        an independent obligation of its own to ensure that the tribunal is enabled
                        to fulfil its statutory responsibilities. The exercise of this regulatory
                        function places the Law Society in a wholly different position to that of a
                        party to ordinary civil litigation. The normal approach to costs decisions
                        in such litigation—dealing with it very broadly, that properly
                        incurred costs should follow the “event” and be paid by the
                        unsuccessful party—would appear to have no direct application to
                        disciplinary proceedings against a solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Importantly, the Court of Appeal in <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em> concluded that there was no
                    assumption that an order for costs in favour of a solicitor who has successfully
                    defeated an allegation of professional misconduct would automatically follow (at
                    [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment Jackson J was right to equate the responsibilities of
                        the institute in <em>Gorlov's</em> case
                        [2001] ACD 393 with the regulatory actions of the licensing
                        authority in Booth’s case [2000] COD 338. <em>As
                            Bolton’s case [1994] 1 WLR 512 demonstrates, identical,
                            or virtually identical, considerations apply when the Law Society is
                            advancing the public interest and ensuring that cases of possible
                            professional misconduct are properly investigated and, if appropriate,
                            made the subject of formal complaint before the tribunal. Unless the
                            complaint is improperly brought, or, for example, proceeds as it did in
                            Gorlov's case [2001] ACD 393 , as a “shambles from
                            start to finish”, when the Law Society is discharging its
                            responsibilities as a regulator of the profession, an order for costs
                            should not ordinarily be made against it on the basis that costs follow
                            the event</em>. The “event” is simply one factor for
                        consideration. It is not a starting point. There is no assumption that an
                        order for costs in favour of a solicitor who has successfully defeated an
                        allegation of professional misconduct will automatically follow. <em>One crucial feature which should inform the tribunal's costs
                            decision is that the proceedings were brought by the Law Society in
                            exercise of its regulatory responsibility, in the public interest and
                            the maintenance of proper professional standards. For the Law Society to
                            be exposed to the risk of an adverse costs order simply because properly
                            brought proceedings were unsuccessful might have a chilling effect on
                            the exercise of its regulatory obligations, to the public
                            disadvantage</em>. Accordingly, Moses LJ's approach to this issue
                        did not go further than the principles described in this judgment.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     
          <em>Baxendale-Walker
                        (CA)</em> is distinguishable because on the facts of the present case,
                    the Law Society was not the complainant, unlike the Law Society of England and
                    Wales in <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em>. Therefore it
                    cannot be said that the Law Society here was acting as a regulator ensuring that
                    cases of possible professional misconduct are properly investigated and, if
                    appropriate, made the subject of a formal complaint before a disciplinary
                    tribunal in the public interest and in the exercise of a public function. It
                    was, instead, <em>defending</em> an application to review
                    the decision of its Inquiry Committee. Another distinguishing feature is that
                    costs in relation to judicial review proceedings is specifically provided for
                    under s 96(4), and the plain language of sub-section (4) does not prevent
                    the court from making an adverse costs order against the Law Society. This
                    sub-section is drafted differently in comparison with s 103(4) of the LPA,
                    which recognises, inferentially, the public function of the Law Society and its
                    Disciplinary Tribunal. Subsections (3) and (4) to s103 of the LPA read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The costs of and incidental to all proceedings
                            under section 97, 98, 100 or 102 shall be in the discretion of the Judge
                            or of the court before whom the hearing has taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Such costs may include the costs of the Society or
                            Disciplinary Tribunal and may be ordered to be paid by the solicitor by
                            or against whom or by the person by whom any complaint was made or was
                            intended to be made or partly by the solicitor and partly by the other
                            party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Furthermore, on the present facts, there would
                    be no chilling effect against the Law Society in the exercise of its regulatory
                    obligations, if any. This is because the Law Society may take a neutral position
                    where its decisions are challenged under s 96 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Section 96 of the LPA allows a
                    complainant who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Council of the Law
                    Society to apply to court to review that decision. As OS 1048 was the
                    plaintiff’s application, I accept that the Law Society’s involvement
                    as the defendant was unavoidable. That said, the Law Society, however, does not
                    have a general duty or a specific statutory duty to <em>resist or
                        oppose</em> every application that is made to the court under
                    s 96 of the LPA. Section 38(1) of the LPA provides generally that the
                    purpose of the Law Society is to maintain and improve the standards of conduct
                    and learning of the legal profession in Singapore. Nothing in the LPA requires
                    the Law Society to oppose every application that is made to court (under
                    s 96) to review the decision of the Council of the Law
                Society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This proposition – that the Law Society
                    has <em>no</em> statutory or general duty to oppose OS 1048
                    – is supported by the analogous case of <em>Re Shankar
                        Alan</em>, a decision brought to the court’s attention by
                    counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Ragbir Singh Bajwa
                    (“Mr Bajwa”). In that case, the applicant, a solicitor, was
                    successful in his application (which was brought under s 97(1) of the LPA)
                    for a quashing order in respect of the findings of a disciplinary committee that
                    he was guilty of professional misconduct. I pause to mention that s 97(3)
                    of the LPA, like s 96(4), expressly provides that the Judge may make an
                    “order for the payment of costs as may be just”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Counsel for the Law Society in <em>Re Shankar Alan</em>, in objecting to the applicant’s
                    claim for costs to follow the event, maintained that the Disciplinary Committee
                    was established pursuant to a statutory regime regulating the legal profession
                    and that the Law Society, in participating in the proceedings, was doing no more
                    than fulfilling its statutory duty since it had done so in order to assist the
                    court by presenting the opposing arguments to those advanced on the applicant's
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Counsel for the Law Society in <em>Re Shankar Alan</em> also cited <em>Chew Kia
                        Ngee v Singapore Society of Accountants</em> [1988]
                    2 SLR(R) 597 (“<em>Chew Kia
                        Ngee”)</em> in support of his case. In <em>Chew
                        Kia Ngee</em>, the applicant was convicted by the Disciplinary
                    Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants and suspended from practice
                    for five years. The appeal was allowed, but Thean J made no order as to
                    costs on the basis that it was incumbent on the Singapore Society of Accountants
                    in that case to resist the appeal and present its arguments to assist the court
                    in arriving at its decision. Thean J held (<em>Chew Kia
                        Ngee</em> at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I now turn to the question of costs. Clearly, in view of what I have
                        decided, there should be no order as to costs before the Committee. The only
                        question is whether the appellant should be awarded costs of the appeal. I
                        refrain from making this order, and my reason is this. The society has to
                        discharge its duty under the Act; it has not acted improperly or vexatiously
                        as against the appellant. The Committee at their inquiry had made a finding
                        and given their decision against the appellant. Upon appeal by the appellant
                        it seems to me that it is incumbent on the society, in this case at any
                        rate, to resist the appeal and present its argument to court to assist the
                        court in arriving at its decision. Having regard to all the circumstances, I
                        make no order as to costs here and below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Menon JC in <em>Re Shankar
                        Alan</em> distinguished <em>Chew Kia Ngee</em> on
                    the ground that the case before him was unlike that in <em>Chew
                        Kia Ngee</em>, where Thean J had made the finding that it was
                    incumbent on the Singapore Society of Accountants to resist the application. In
                        <em>Re Shankar Alan</em>, there was no duty or
                    obligation imposed on the Law Society to <em>oppose</em>
                    that application to quash the findings of the Disciplinary Committee so as to
                    present the court with an alternative position (<em>Re Shankar
                        Alan</em> at [10]). Menon JC drew a distinction between opposing
                    an application and presenting the court with an alternative position in the
                    following terms (<em>Re Shankar Alan</em> at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to the application for the quashing order, I do not consider that there
                        was any duty or obligation upon the Law Society to <em>oppose</em> that application simply so as to present the court
                        with an alternative position. To some degree, it is almost invariably the
                        case in an adversarial system that the court in arriving at its decision
                        finds the greatest assistance in a vigorously contested argument. However,
                        that does not mean a prospective litigant is obliged to contest a position
                        simply to facilitate this, or that he can avoid the usual consequence of
                        being made liable for costs if he is unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade
                        the court. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Menon JC noted that it was open to the
                    Law Society to take no active position on the application (<em>Re
                        Shankar Alan</em> at [11]). He noted that the Law Society had done
                    exactly that in <em>Re Singh Kalpanath</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 595, by choosing not to participate in the proceedings and
                    adopting a neutral stand. As a result, Chan Sek Keong J took the view that
                    the applicant there was not entitled to costs against the Law Society (<em>Re Singh Kalpanath</em> at [102]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Although the applicant in <em>Re Shankar Alan</em> applied for a quashing order pursuant to
                    s 97(1) of the LPA, and the application on the facts here was made under
                    s 96(1) of the LPA, a similar reading of s 96(1) of the LPA would lead
                    one to the same conclusion that the Law Society did not have a statutory or any
                    other obligation to resist or <em>oppose</em> the
                    application under s 96(1) of the LPA. It will be apparent from the facts
                    set out below that the Law Society here had strenuously resisted the
                    plaintiff’s application in OS 1048 on the ground that it was baseless and
                    unwarranted. Simply put, the Law Society here did not take a neutral
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The distinction between taking a neutral
                    position and opposing an application as was drawn in <em>Re
                        Shankar Alan</em>, is defensible in light of the government’s
                    concern that there were doubts that the self-regulating bodies were willing to
                    discipline their own members. In 1986, the Second Minister for Law (Prof S
                    Jayakumar) (see Parliamentary Debates of 22 September 1986) proposed
                    significant amendments to the provisions dealing with the disciplinary processes
                    of the legal profession and stated that (at cols 672 and 673):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In recent times, the permissive attitude of these self-regulating bodies
                        have created doubts in their willingness to police themselves or to
                        discipline members of their own kind…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I must add that most of these cases of misconduct which I have referred
                        to, have become public knowledge only because they have been brought before
                        our courts. Many other instances of misconduct go unnoticed and unreported
                        as to how they are leniently disposed of by the Inquiry or Disciplinary
                        Committee in which there is no representation for the consumer or
                        public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, because of the confidentiality which surrounds the investigations by
                        the Bar and because all persons involved in the investigations are
                        themselves members of the Bar, surely dissatisfied members of the public
                        would have good reasons to question the manner of such investigations. This
                        is a grey area.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is faulty with respect to the present structure for the discipline of
                        lawyers, and it must be put right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Further, the Report of the Select Committee on
                    the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill No 20/ 86 (at pg A5) explained
                    that the proposed amendments to the disciplinary process were due to a
                    perception that the legal profession was not willing to take action against its
                    errant members. Specifically, in relation to the Inquiry Committee, the Report
                    of the Select Committee (at p A22) had this to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The IC and the Council currently serve the very useful function of weeding
                        out groundless complaints. Of the complaints submitted to the Inquiry
                        Committee, few are referred to the DC. Though the government is of the view
                        that this shows permissiveness on the part of the Inquiry Committee it must
                        also be true that some of the complaints were groundless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Even though lay persons now form part of the
                    Inquiry Committee (s 84(1) of the LPA), allowing the Law Society to freely
                    oppose an application for review of its decision without adverse costs
                    consequences could unintentionally perpetuate the public’s perception
                    which the government aimed to correct by amending the LPA – that the Law
                    Society is unwilling to discipline its members. Furthermore, in terms of the
                    balance of power between the Law Society and the complainant, it must be borne
                    in mind that the complainant is often a client of the solicitor, <em>i.e</em>. he or she is unlikely to be legally
                trained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     A third ground for distinguishing <em>Baxendale-Walker (CA)</em> is the fact that in that case, the
                    Tribunal, which is a separate entity from the Law Society of England and Wales,
                    was tasked with making a decision. However, the Tribunal did not take part in
                    the appeal to defend its own decision. On the other hand, the Singapore system
                    does not have an independent tribunal separate from the Law Society. Instead,
                    the Law Society constitutes Inquiry Committees, Review Committees and
                    Disciplinary Committee to assist it in making a decision on the matter. In other
                    words, the Law Society here did not participate in the hearing before the Judge
                    in its capacity as a regulator of the legal profession, but rather, in its
                    capacity as the maker of its decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint
                    and with a view to defending its own decision. In the circumstances, it would be
                    difficult to contend that the Law Society was acting in the public interest as
                    opposed to its own private interests. In <em>Corner House
                        Research</em> (at [144]), Corner House Research had no private
                    interest in the outcome of the case; in contrast, the Law Society’s
                    strenuous defence of its decision has an element of self-interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On these grounds, I would dismiss the Law
                    Society’s argument that no costs ought to be ordered against it as it was
                    performing a public function.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for ordering 50% costs against the Law Society</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case, the Law Society put up
                    strenuous opposition to the plaintiff’s application to review its decision
                    to dismiss the Complaint. The Law Society took the position that OS 1048 should
                    be dismissed as Mr Bader’s affidavits filed in OS 1048 related to
                    matters that were outside the scope of the Complaint as considered and
                    deliberated by the Inquiry Committee. There were broadly three complaints before
                    the Inquiry Committee (see also above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>). The first related to the alleged exorbitant fees charged by
                    Mr Arul and the inquiry was on whether there was an agreement on
                    Mr Arul’s professional fees in respect of MC Suit 18905 of 2005 and
                    DC 903 of 2006. The Inquiry Committee considered and accepted
                    Mr Arul’s explanation and held that there was no agreement on
                    professional fees. I affirmed the Inquiry Committee’s decision on this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The second complaint related to the allegation
                    that Mr Arul had received strict instructions not to transfer any money
                    from the client’s account but disobeyed those instructions by transferring
                    the sums of $54,909 and $32,000 respectively from the client’s account to
                    satisfy Mr Arul’s bills for professional services rendered which
                    bills were being disputed at the time of the transfers. Mr Bajwa pointed
                    out that the essence of the complaint was that Mr Arul had received moneys
                    into client’s account contrary to clear instructions in
                    Mr Bader’s e-mail dated 7 July 2006 directing the sum of
                    $114,440.97 to be paid to the plaintiff. Ms Ambika Rajendram (“Ms
                    Rajendram”), the director of Law Society’s Conduct Department,
                    deposed in her affidavit filed on 27 March 2009 that Mr Bader’s
                    allegation was not part of the Complaint that was lodged by the plaintiff with
                    the Law Society and was never the subject of any inquiry undertaken by the
                    Inquiry Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The e-mail dated 7 July 2006 from
                    Mr Bader to Mr Arul reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Andre,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I can see from the demand you have requested that Leivest pay to the
                        lawyers account. I would appreciate if you change this and make it payable
                        directly to Top Ten account and not to your company first. Kindly confirm
                        that this will be done and payment will be directly received by Top
                        Ten.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">TKS Regards P Bader</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Even though the 7 July 2006 e-mail was
                    inadvertently not furnished to the Law Society, the 24 August 2006 e-mail
                    was provided. The relevant portion of Mr Bader’s e-mail dated
                    24 August 2006 to Mr Arul reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.   You were informed in July 2006 that all moneys that
                        would be paid by Leivest International Pte Ltd must be paid directly to Top
                        Ten Ent. Pte Ltd and not into client’s account. Despite that
                        instruction you had the money paid into client’s account!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Notably, Mr Arul in his written reply
                    dated 7 February 2008, did <em>not</em> refer the
                    Inquiry Committee to the 7 July 2006 e-mail or the 24 August 2006
                    e-mail. Instead, he relied and commented on an e-mail dated 18 August 2006
                    (which was a different e-mail) in response to the second complaint, <em>viz</em>, Mr Arul had received strict instructions not
                    to transfer any money from client’s account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> To my mind, Mr Arul had received these
                    e-mails with clear instructions to pay party and party costs (<em>ie</em>, $114,440.97) directly to the plaintiff. He ought to have
                    commented on them in his reply to the Inquiry Committee on 5 February 2008
                    since the two e-mails were referred to in Mr Bader’s statutory
                    declarations. These e-mails would have shed light on whether the party and party
                    costs were in the first place properly received in the client’s account
                    with Mr Arul’s firm in contrast to the Inquiry Committee’s
                    assumption that moneys in client’s account were properly received. As a
                    consequence, the question that the Inquiry Committee considered was whether
                    Mr Arul was allowed under his warrant to act to utilise money in the
                    client’s account to settle the firm’s bills for professional
                    services rendered to the plaintiff. I agreed with Mr Bajwa’s argument
                    that the fact that the Inquiry Committee did not pick up the client’s
                    express instructions when it could have did not mean that the non-observance of
                    strict instructions was no longer a part of the Complaint and had to be
                    re-lodged as a new complaint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In these circumstances, there was
                    justification for referring the matter to a Disciplinary Tribunal for
                    investigation on Mr Arul’s <em>prima facie</em>
                    failure to comply with his client’s specific instructions to have the
                    money paid directly to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There was a further complaint relating to a
                    sum of $10,000 which represented the security for costs that M/s Peter
                    Phang &amp; Co as solicitor for Leivest International Pte Ltd
                    (“Leivest”) had paid to Mr Arul’s firm after Leivest
                    lost its appeal and was obliged to pay costs of the appeal to the plaintiff. In
                    that regard, the $10,000 received by Mr Arul was paid into
                    Mr Arul’s office account and not into the client’s account,
                    contrary to Rule 3 of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules. In her second
                    affidavit dated 29 June 2009, Ms Rajendram deposed that this
                    allegation concerning the $10,000 had been considered by the Inquiry Committee
                    during the inquiry process. Later and after an adjournment of the proceedings,
                    Ms Rajendram explained in her third affidavit filed on 25 September
                    2009 that she had re-visited the Inquiry Committee Report and wished to clarify
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is in fact <u>not clear</u> from the said
                        report if the Inquiry Committee did look into the First Allegation
                            (<em>ie</em>, $10,000 security for costs). I should
                        also point out that Andre Arul did not address any issues relating to the
                        First Allegation in his written explanation to the Inquiry Committee dated
                        5 February 2008. ... [emphasis original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That said, Ms Rajendram went on to argue that the
                    plaintiff’s allegation relating to the sum of $10,000 fell outside the
                    scope of his Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having regard to the arguments, affidavit
                    evidence and exhibits thereto, it seems to me that the plaintiff acted
                    reasonably in commencing OS 1048 to review the decision of the Council of the
                    Law Society. The plaintiff had to fight hard, in the face of strenuous
                    opposition by the Law Society, to have his Complaint brought before a
                    Disciplinary Tribunal. I saw from the brief outline of the position and
                    arguments adopted by the Law Society that there was some misunderstanding of the
                    evidence and that there existed compelling reasons justifying the court to
                    interfere in the decision of the Council of the Law Society to dismiss the
                    Complaint as a whole. The plaintiff was successful in defeating part of the
                    Council of the Law Society’s decision and should, therefore, be allowed to
                    recover some of its costs. However, in other respects, the Law Society won. In
                    my view, it was a proper exercise of judicial discretion to order the Law
                    Society to pay half of the plaintiff’s costs having regard to the
                    following factors. First, the Inquiry Committee’s finding that there was
                    no agreement in professional fees was affirmed. Second, I was not prepared to
                    give the plaintiff more than 50% of the costs as much of the difficulties faced
                    by the Inquiry Committee, which made its tasks all the more time-consuming and
                    problematic were the result of the messy presentation of the Complaint lodged by
                    the plaintiff. The attendant risk of misunderstanding the evidence was all too
                    real. The plaintiff’s absence at the Inquiry despite the Inquiry
                    Committee’s invitation to the plaintiff compounded the difficulties. On
                    the other hand, I am also mindful that Mr Arul’s written reply of
                    7 February 2008 did not deal with the relevant e-mails. In the result, the
                    hearing of OS 1048 became protracted. All these were matters which a court could
                    take into consideration in deciding what was just and reasonable costs to award
                    in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the reasons stated, I ordered the Law
