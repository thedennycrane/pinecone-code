<strong>
<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.    The accused is a 19-year old junior college

student who pleaded guilty to four charges, two of which were under s 377 of the Penal

Code, Ch 224 and two under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code, Ch 224. The first charge was

for fellatio against an 11-year old girl. The second charge was for using criminal force

to outrage the modesty of a 9-year old girl. The third charge was for fellatio against the

same 9-year old girl. The fourth charge was for using criminal force to outrage the

modesty of another 11-year old girl.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The accused had previously been convicted on 28

January 1999 on a long list of sexual offences as well as offences relating to theft and

causing hurt. He was sentenced to three years Reformative Training. He managed to obtain

his O-level certificate whilst serving this sentence. He enrolled in a well-known and

prestigious junior college upon his release. He was apparently well liked and his teacher

reported him as a bright and articulate student.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    In mitigation, his counsel Mr. Palakrishnan SC

submitted that the cause of this obviously deviant personality of the accused can be

traced to his childhood experience of finding his grandmother, with whom he was very

attached, stabbed to death by robbers. He was the only child of a business executive

father and a doctor mother. Mr. Palakrishnan submitted that the accused was driven to put

up a bold front in the face of his emotionally weak parents. There is some support in the

psychiatric report of Dr Gwee Kok Peng, dated 31 March 2002, that the accused suffers from

some behavioral problems that require group and individual therapy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    The offences which he had committed were serious

because the victims were very young and some violence was employed in the course of the

crime. These offences were also committed while he was still under supervision upon his

release from the Reformative Training Centre. The present offences as well as his

antecedents appear to have the mark of a serial offender’s stamp over them. These

circumstances warrant a long deterrent sentence against him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    It is a pity when a bright young man spends the

bloom of youth behind bars; but it will be a greater tragedy if he does not correct

himself - because he may end up spending the rest of his useful life in jail.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    Given the circumstances of the case and having

regard to the submissions of Mr. Palakrishnan and DPP Lim Yew Jin, I sentenced the accused

to seven years imprisonment in respect of the first charge; four years imprisonment and

six strokes of the cane in respect of the second charge; seven years imprisonment in

respect of the third charge; and four years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in

respect of the fourth charge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    I ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in

respect of the first, third and fourth charges to run consecutively from 21 January 2002,

and the term of imprisonment in respect of the second charge to run concurrently with

them; making a total of 18 years imprisonment and a total of 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
