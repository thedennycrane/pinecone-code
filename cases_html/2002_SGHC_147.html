found on Yani. She was examined at Changi General Hospital on 22 June 2001 at 4.00 am by

Dr Tan Kok Yang ("Dr Tan") who prepared a medical report. The injuries found on

<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Tan also gave testimony in court that, in his own medical report, he

<p xmlns="">3.        The appellant did not deny that she caused

the secondary degree burn, which was the most serious of all the injuries found on Yani.

Her defence at trial was that she had accidentally scalded Yani on her left arm, while the

rest of the injuries found on Yani were claimed by the appellant to have been

self-inflicted by Yani.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Yani’s version of events on 21 June 2001</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">4.        It is important to lay out in full the

actual words used by Yani during her testimony in court to describe the incident, which

resulted in the three charges being brought against the appellant : 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">On 21 June 2001, at about 1.00 am, my employer kicks my

  back 3 times. I was then washing clothing in the bathroom. Maybe it was because I

  didn’t have enough sleep. I was sleepy and she kicked me 3 times. It was painful. I

  didn’t say anything to her. Maybe my employer thought I was sleeping at that time,

  then my employer poured hot water at the back of my neck, towards the lower part of my

  neck. Maybe, she took the water from the thermos flask. She used a cup to get the water. <i>It

  was hot.</i> I didn’t say anything. I continued washing the clothing because <i>I

  felt hot</i> in my face. I looked down. Maybe my employer thought then I was still

  sleeping. Then she poured hot water on me. She wanted to pour hot water on my face. Then I

  used my left hand to block, using my left upper arm. I kept quiet. <i>I felt very very

  hot.</i> I didn’t respond. I continued to wash clothing. I felt scared.[emphasis

  added]</p>
</font>
</ol>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant’s version of events</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">5.        The district judge had found that there

were many shifts in the appellant’s defence. This would be elaborated upon later on.

The ultimate version which the appellant put forth and maintained at this appeal was that

she had accidentally caused the scalding on the morning of 20 June 2001. She had been in

the kitchen cooking and was at the sink holding a bowl of hot water. Yani came into the

kitchen and squatted down to retrieve a floor mat in the cabinet below the sink. When

Andres (the appellant’s baby boy whom Yani was employed to look after) started

crying, Yani stood up and knocked into the appellant, causing the hot water to spill onto

Yani. After the incident, she had apologised to Yani and applied cream for her. In the

evening of 20 June 2001, the whole family, together with Yani, had gone to the National

Library to do research for a hearing the next day at the Small Claims Tribunal. They

arrived home at about 9.30 pm. Both the appellant and her husband wanted to prepare for

their case by reading the materials which they had photocopied earlier at the National

Library. At around 12.30 am on 21 June 2001, they started preparing video clips to be used

as evidence for their case. They only finished the video clips at around 2.00 am. The next

morning, they were at the Small Claims Tribunal until 2.30 pm. In the evening, the whole

family went out together with Yani to order a birthday cake at Ang Mo Kio Central. They

reached home at about 10.00 pm and it was at about 10.45 pm that two policemen who had

responded to a call arrived.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The testimony of the two policemen</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">6.        On 21 June 2001, the police received an

anonymous telephone call from a male caller at 10.36 pm. The caller stated ‘Maid was

abused’ and gave the home address of the appellant. Sgt Tan Chee Hiong ("Sgt

Tan") and Sgt Neo Weiko ("Sgt Neo") were dispatched to the appellant’s

home. When they arrived, it was the appellant’s husband, Low Gim Huat ("Mr

Low"), who came to the door. The police officers informed him of a maid abuse

complaint. They were not let immediately into the apartment but were told to wait for a

while, before the door was closed on them. Several minutes later, the appellant opened the

door to let the police officers in.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.        When they were within the apartment, the

police officers attempted to ask Yani what happened. Questions were addressed to Yani but

the appellant kept on interrupting during the questioning. The appellant told them that

Yani had an injury at the left upper arm. Sgt Tan saw that there was a bandage on her arm

and asked Yani to remove it. However, he saw only parts of the injury as the bandage was

stuck onto the skin and Yani was in pain. The appellant appeared scared and nervous. As

the appellant kept on interrupting on the questioning of Yani, Sgt Tan had to bring Yani

outside the unit, out onto the corridor to interview her. Yani was reluctant to speak and

appeared tearful and scared. When Sgt Tan persisted in asking her to tell the truth, she

broke down and told him in broken English that the appellant threw hot water onto her. Sgt

Tan called for assistance. SIO William Lee came to the scene with a Malay interpreter and

interviewed Yani. A white mug identified by Yani as used by the appellant to throw hot

water onto her was then seized from the kitchen. Photographs were also directed to be

taken.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.        Sgt Neo also recalled an occurrence when

the appellant had behaved strangely by inviting him into the study room, when Sgt Tan went

outside the unit to speak to SIO William Lee. She informed him that she had something to

talk to him privately. When he entered into the room with her, she closed the door. She

said that she didn’t abuse the maid. Sgt Neo felt that the statement was a general

one and immediately opened the door as he was afraid of allegations of molest and

corruption. As he opened the door, he saw Mr Low walking away from Yani upon discovering

that he (Sgt Tan) was coming out of the room.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision below</p>
<p></p></i>9.        At the conclusion of the trial, the

district judge found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

There was no evidence of inconsistency in the prosecution’s case. Neither was any one

of the prosecution’s witnesses discredited. Yani’s consistent story was

corroborated by the testimony of the two police officers who were disinterested witnesses.

There was also independent medical evidence of Yani’s numerous injuries.<i xmlns="">
<p></p></i>10.        On the other hand, he found that the

appellant’s version of the incident changed several times during the trial. The first

version started with Yani squatting down to wash clothes in the kitchen bathroom. The

appellant walked in holding a mug of hot water, when Yani suddenly got up and knocked into

the appellant. Then, the story changed to one where the appellant was <u xmlns="">cooking</u> in

the kitchen, and Yani was <u xmlns="">washing clothes </u>in the kitchen bathroom. Later, it

changed again, to that of Yani <u xmlns="">coming into the kitchen, </u>squatting down to retrieve

a floor-mat and in the process of getting up, colliding with the appellant who was then

holding a <u xmlns="">cup</u> of hot water. Eventually, when the appellant testified, she changed

the story to her <u xmlns="">soaking utensils </u>in hot water and holding <u xmlns="">a small rice bowl</u>

of hot water. Finally, in the closing submissions of the defence, it changed again, to

that of the appellant <u xmlns="">soaking a bowl with hot water</u> (the district judge’s

emphasis).<i xmlns="">
<p></p></i>11.        The defence of the appellant that

Yani had self-inflicted the injuries on herself, other than the burn injury, was found to

be far-fetched and unbelievable. The defence’s submission was that the injuries were

self-inflicted either within the six days before photographs of the injuries were taken on

27 June 2001 or when the appellant and her husband were at the Small Claims Tribunal on

the morning of 21 June 2001. The first possibility was groundless as Yani was examined on

22 June 2001. As for the second possibility, the district judge found it incredible that,

after the scalding incident, Yani, without any motive or purpose, immediately came up with

a scheme, self-inflicted such extensive injuries on herself and then informed the police

through an anonymous telephone call by an unidentified male. Despite all the preparation,

which the appellant had apparently done with the intention to repatriate Yani back to

Indonesia, there was no evidence that Yani had any knowledge of it at all.

<p xmlns="">12.        Therefore, the district judge convicted

the appellant and sentenced her to ten months’ imprisonment for scalding Yani with

hot water, two months’ imprisonment for kicking Yani’s back three times and also

imposed a fine of $500 for pouring warm water on the back of her head. The imprisonment

sentences were ordered to run concurrently.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
<p></p></i>13.        In this appeal, the bulk of the

appellant’s challenges were directed towards the district judge’s findings of

fact. The principles governing an appellate court’s role in reviewing a trial

judge’s findings of fact are well-settled. In <i xmlns="">PP v Azman bin</i> <i xmlns="">Abdullah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46369&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame" xmlns="">[1998] 2 SLR 704</a> at  21, I made the following observations : 

<ol start="13" xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a

  finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial

  judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An

  appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, <i>must not

  merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is

  wrong : see PP v Poh Oh Sim </i>[1990] SLR 1047 [emphasis added].</p>
</font>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I now turn to the appeal proper.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Shifts in the appellant’s defence</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">14.        It was contended that the supposed shifts

in the defence as highlighted by the district judge in his judgment happened as a result

of a series of mistakes made by the appellant’s counsel and that she had informed him

accordingly of the mistakes, immediately after the hearing on 29 October and again before

3 December 2001. When the appellant’s counsel made mistakes again at the hearing on 3

December 2001, the appellant discharged him and represented herself in court. As such, the

defence was only brought in line with the correct version ultimately put forth on 3

December 2001. What the district judge cited as a shift was no more than the

appellant’s reaffirming the correct version of what happened.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.        I found this difficult to accept. The

shifts in defence did not merely involve which receptacle the appellant was holding when

the accident occurred; whether it was a mug or a bowl or a cup. It shifted entirely from

Yani <i>squatting down to wash clothes in the kitchen bathroom </i>and the appellant <i>walking

in with a mug of hot water </i>to Yani <i>being in the kitchen </i>squatting down <i>to

retrieve a floor mat </i>and knocking into the appellant <i>who was at the sink with a

bowl of hot water. </i>The appellant was noted by the district judge to be a highly

intelligent woman. She was writing notes throughout the whole trial. On 29 October 2001,

there were several occasions when she had signalled to her counsel for communication. The

district judge had allowed the counsel to step over to the dock to discuss things with

her. The ‘mistakes’ made by counsel were not minor contradictions but deviated

greatly from the supposed ‘correct version’. And yet the appellant failed to

point out those mistakes to her counsel or to the court during the trial of 29 October

2001, despite having had several opportunities to do so.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The video clips</p>
<p></p></i>16.        The district judge was doubtful of

the timings stated in the video clips which were recorded on the night of the alleged

abuse. In his view, the timer could always be adjusted to reflect the time desired.

Counsel for the appellant argued that the district judge had erred in this regard. I

accept his submissions that, while the timer could be adjusted <i xmlns="">before</i> the recording

started, it could not be done so <i xmlns="">after</i> the recording. There was sufficient evidence

to show that the preparation of the video clips was made way before the police arrived at

the appellant’s apartment on the night of 21 June 2001. As such, there was no reason

to doubt the authenticity of the video clips.

<p xmlns="">17.        Nevertheless, in my opinion, the district

judge was correct to attach very little weight to the video clips. The video clips were

tendered as evidence in court to substantiate the appellant’s claim that she was

assisting her husband, Mr Low, to make the video clips on 21 June 2001 between 12.30 pm to

2.00 am. It was argued that she could not thus have scalded Yani at around 1.15 am, the

time at which the incident was alleged to have occurred. However, the first two video

clips was found to have stated the time to be 12.53 am and 1.23 am respectively and they

did not contain any images. The third video clip had a recording of a wooden TV console as

well as of Mr Low opening drawers, with the appellant’s voice in the background. This

third video clip had the timing stated as 1.54 am. As the first two video clips did not

contain any images, and the time of the alleged abuses as stated in the charges were

between 1 am and 1.15 am, it was clear that the video clips did not help to advance the

appellant’s case. In addition, Mr Low’s testimony that the appellant was with

him during the entire recording of the video clips had to be treated with caution as he

was found to be an interested witness. Mr Low’s doubts, hesitation, signs of anxiety

and nervousness in court as recorded by the district judge further eroded his credibility

as a witness. In my view, the district judge was clearly entitled to disbelieve Mr

Low’s testimony.<i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Yani’s testimony of the incident</p>
<p xmlns="">18.  It was argued that the district judge was wrong to have believed

Yani’s testimony as her version of events was inherently incredible. Yani had

testified that she was squatting down in the toilet and was sleepy. Presumably she was

leaning forward. SIO William Lee’s testimony was that Yani had told him that her

employer came from behind and used hot water to splash on her left arm. In such a

position, it was not possible for Yani to have known where the water was obtained from or

the receptacle used by the appellant and yet Yani identified both the thermos flask and

the mug respectively. Furthermore, Yani’s version that she used her arm to ward off

the hot water would have necessitated or at least given cause for the sides of her body to

be scalded as well and yet there were no burn marks on the left side of her body. In

addition, it was most unusual how the same ‘hot’ water could have such markedly

different effects, causing no marks or burns on Yani’s neck but yet purportedly hot

enough to scald her arm.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.        In my opinion, there is really nothing so

unbelievable about Yani’s testimony. She had testified in her examination-in-chief

that "maybe, she took the water from the thermos flask". She was not clear as to

the origin of the hot water but surely it was not difficult for her to assume that it came

from a thermos flask in the kitchen, in which hot water is normally stored. Furthermore,

it could not be said that it was impossible for her to see the receptacle used by the

appellant to splash hot water on her, <i>as</i> she raised her left arm to ward off the

water. It was a reflex action, indicative of the fact that Yani must have seen the

appellant approaching her with the receptacle a few moments before the hot water was

actually splashed onto her left arm.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.        As for the fact that there were no burn

marks on her left side, it did not mean that Yani’s version was not to be preferred

over the appellant’s. The district judge was entitled to note the nature of the

injury from the photographs, as a well-defined burn from severe scalding and compare it

with both the appellant’s and Yani’s versions of the events. I was inclined to

believe that such a well-defined burn would more likely be caused by a deliberate

splashing of hot water using direct force rather than an accidental spillage of hot water

from a bowl. In my view, the district judge was correct to make the determination that

Yani’s version of events was more in line with the burn injury.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.        As for the allegation that the

‘hot’ water was the same and could not have caused different effects, the

district judge had dealt with this point thoroughly in his judgment and, in this regard,

it was not possible to overturn his finding of fact. He had rightly noted that Yani used

two different descriptions for the temperature of water. He had also referred to <i>Kamus

Dwibahasa, </i>a Malay dictionary and found that in the Malay language, no difference is

made between ‘warm’ and ‘hot’. In the light of such observations, he

was of the view that the two different phrases used by Yani to describe what she felt to

be different temperatures poured on her neck and her arm respectively, ‘hot’ and

‘very very hot’ must be regarded as sensible and fitting in the circumstances.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The rest of the injuries</p>
</i>
<p xmlns="">22.        In the medical report itself, Dr Tan had

recorded that he was unable to say anything of the age of the injuries and that the

possibility of self-infliction of the injuries was uncertain. Counsel for the appellant

argued that there was no evidence that Yani was never allowed to leave the apartment. She

had had opportunities to meet with the neighbours and even to mingle with other maids in

the estate. If the appellant had indeed abused Yani, why had she not complained to anyone

about it? Yani could also have gone to her agent, Florence Chua ("Ms Chua"), for

help but she did not do so. It was said that the only reasonable explanation for this was

that the appellant had never assaulted or abused her. The district judge failed to

consider sufficiently the possibility that the rest of the injuries, other than the burn

injury found on Yani, were self-inflicted or even that they were old injuries from bruises

that Yani had sustained during the course of the work.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.        From the evidence, it seemed that the

only time that Yani was left alone in the apartment after the alleged ‘scalding

accident’ on 20 June 2001 was when the appellant and her husband had been at the

Small Claims Tribunal. It is doubtful that during that short span of time, Yani could have

self-inflicted herself with such extensive injuries and then come up with a scheme to get

an anonymous male caller to inform the police.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.        More importantly, the appellant had not

been able to give a reasonable explanation as to why Yani would have wanted to

self-inflict injuries on herself. The only reason that the appellant offered was that Yani

did not want to be sent back to Indonesia. Yet, despite all that was being done to

repatriate Yani back to Indonesia, such as obtaining a letter of repatriation from the

maid agency, there was no evidence whatsoever that Yani had any knowledge of it. Without a

motive on Yani’s part, it is an incredible defence to say that Yani had planned,

executed and endured such a great extent of injuries on herself.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.        To suggest that the injuries were

sustained in the course of work was even more revealing. There were bruises corresponding

to <i>finger marks </i>on the right arm of Yani. By no stretch of any imagination, could

it be said that such bruises were sustained in the ordinary course of work as a domestic

maid.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The biting incident</p>
<p></p></i>26.        It transpired during the trial that

Yani had bitten the arm of the appellant’s baby, Andres, once before and this had

been reported to the police by the appellant on 23 March 2001. It was argued by the

counsel for the appellant that this incident was of major significance; namely, that it

showed the vicious nature and character of Yani in biting a helpless 9-month old baby,

Yani’s propensity to lie in court and finally the forgiving and considerate nature of

the appellant in giving Yani a second chance and not repatriating her immediately. Counsel

for the appellant made much of this incident, contending that the district judge had,

unfortunately, not appreciated sufficiently the significance of this biting incident.

<p xmlns="">27.        A reading of the judgment of the district

judge revealed that he did, in fact, accept that Yani had bitten the arm of the baby and

had considered the issue of whether a maid who had bitten a baby could well concoct lies

to ‘frame’ the appellant. He was of the conclusion that Yani had not been

inconsistent and saw no reason to disbelieve her testimony that she bit the baby when the

appellant was beating her legs with a toy stick. Yani had never given different versions

of the biting incident herself. Her version of the incident was contradicted by the maid

agent, Ms Chua and by the appellant’s good friend, Basil Camoeus, who spoke to Yani

soon after the incident. However, the district judge had dealt with their evidence

thoroughly. He found that Ms Chua was only told about the incident by the appellant

herself and had never had the opportunity to speak to Yani about it. As such, Yani could

not have told her that she bit the baby because she wanted to force a three-pin plug out

of the baby’s mouth. As for Basil Cameous’s testimony, the district judge found

it to be vague and did not establish much other than the fact that Yani had bitten the

baby, a point which was not disputed. Despite the biting incident, the district judge

found, on the totality of evidence before him, that Yani had been truthful and that there

was no basis to reject her evidence. I saw no reason to depart from the district

judge’s finding that Yani had neither been inconsistent nor had she concocted lies to

frame the appellant.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p>
<p></p></i>28.        In conclusion, I found that the

appellant could not succeed in her appeal. She was unable to show that the district judge

was wrong in coming to his conclusion that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a

reasonable doubt. Yani was merely eighteen years old at the time of employment and the

appellant was her first employer since she arrived in Singapore from Indonesia. The

actions of the appellant in abusing a mere eighteen-year old girl under her power and

authority were wholly reprehensible. The district judge had properly considered all the

circumstances of the case on the issue of sentence and the sentence could not be regarded

as manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence

imposed by the court below.
