</div> In response to this particular point, the Investors claim that the language of Article 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law makes it plain that the court must come to its own view on whether the arbitral procedure was in accordance with the parties’ agreement, and this entails considering whether costs claimed by GOL have in fact been incurred. The Investors also remark that it would be illogical for this Court to not be able to review the Tribunal’s findings of fact made in the course of applying the agreed procedure: if this were the case, procedural challenges would virtually never succeed since the courts would have to mechanically defer to the tribunals’ application of the procedural rules.

The result is that what constitutes “full opportunity” is a contextual inquiry of whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair, and the approach a court should take is to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done: <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695 at [104].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In light of the foregoing principles, it is evident to us that the Investors’ respective rights to be heard were not breached in the manner alleged.

The [Investors] inserted their comments into the same chart, to which [SM and Gass] replied, after which the completed Preclusion Chart was filed on 28 August 2020. An examination of this Chart reveals that the issues before this Tribunal are identical (identity being understood in the manner just described) to those before the Prior SIAC Arbitration. The content of the chart is discussed below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It can be seen then that the Tribunal made determinations of law and fact in relation to a doctrine of substantive law under the governing law, namely New York law.

</div> However, in light of the general principle expounded above, where those reasons are premised on certain determinations of fact and law made by the tribunal, those determinations must be taken as they are unless they have been tainted by process failures. It is not open to the court to examine the correctness of those determinations. Here, the Tribunal’s reason for not dealing with the Investors’ Estopped Claims is that they have been precluded by the New York doctrine of collateral estoppel, a finding underpinned by various factual and legal determinations made by the Tribunal. The Investors are not alleging that they have not been heard on the collateral estoppel issue.

</div> That case concerned an award in which the tribunal had determined that <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applied in relation to findings of the Malaysian Industrial Court (“MIC”) which therefore bound parties in relation to the dispute in arbitration (at [33]). The Court of Appeal, at [1], made the following opening observation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In brief, the appellants are aggrieved because the arbitral tribunal before which they appeared held that they were prevented by the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> from litigating on a vital component of their defence to the respondents’ claim in the arbitration. They say there is nothing more repugnant to the most basic notions of justice than to deny it to one party. That may be so, but whether “denial of justice” is an appropriate way in which to label what happened in the arbitration proceedings is another matter. Litigants affected adversely by the application of the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> doctrine, a long-established common law doctrine, often consider themselves to have been unfairly deprived of their right to a hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">BTN</span>, it was first argued unsuccessfully that there was a breach of justice concerning the hearing on the <span class="font-italic">res </span>judicata issue, for example whether the tribunal had based its decision on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> on factual matters even though parties had agreed that disputed matters of fact would not be taken into account by the tribunal (at [44]).

</div> The Investors do not raise any denial of justice in how the issue of possible preclusion was heard and determined. Rather the Investors contend that the fact of preclusion gives rise to the breach of natural justice. There is no merit in this argument. The invocation of any preclusionary doctrine means that a party will not be heard on the aspects of the case that it is precluded from re-opening. Such doctrines serve the cause of justice by promoting finality in litigation, and their existence not only in Singapore law but in many if not most legal systems demonstrates that they are not in and of themselves objectionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Public policy was also raised in <span class="font-italic">BTN</span> and likewise in the present case. We now turn to that ground of challenge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue A2: whether the Award was in conflict with Singapore’s public policy of access to justice, given that the Investors were not heard on the merits of their Estopped Claims against SM and Gass </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span> It is helpful to start with <span class="font-italic">BTN</span>. In introducing the public policy challenge in that matter, the Court of Appeal explained, at [56]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The public policy ground for setting aside provided by Art 34(2) of the Model Law is a narrow one. This court has held that the ground should only succeed in cases where upholding or enforcing the arbitral award would “shock the conscience”, or be “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public”, or violate “the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice”: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">PT Asuransi</span>”) at [59]. In this respect, we reiterate that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">res judicata</span> has long been part of the law of Singapore and its invocation in cases brought in the Singapore courts is not unusual. Accordingly, a decision based on <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">res judicata</span> principles can never in itself be described as shocking the conscience or wholly offensive to informed members of the public. Recognising this, the appellants aim their attack at <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">erroneous</span> applications of the doctrine. Importantly, however, the general principle is that even if an arbitral tribunal’s findings of law and/or fact are wrong, such errors would not <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">per se</span> engage the public policy of Singapore: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">AJU v AJT</span> [2011] 4 SLR 739 at [66]; <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">PT Asuransi</span> at [57].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus, an award that is made based on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> principles is not for that reason contrary to public policy. The appellants in <span class="font-italic">BTN</span> raised two arguments why the award in that case contravened public policy. The first rested on the premise that they had not been aware of the MIC proceedings (at [57(a)]). The second rested on the claim that the respondents had breached the arbitration agreement by instituting the proceedings before the MIC (at [57(b)]). First of all, the Court of Appeal was not persuaded on the facts, noting at [59] that the appellants have been served with eight notices relating to the MIC proceedings and at [63] that they had neither commenced arbitration proceedings themselves nor sought to restrain the MIC proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Court of Appeal went further, however, at [72] and [73], and held that even an erroneous ruling of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> would not found a challenge to the award on the basis of public policy.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Investors’ argument conflates two distinct doctrines, namely collateral estoppel under New York law and the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> under Singapore law. They have different requirements. The Tribunal was tasked to decide what the requirements were under each of the doctrines and whether those requirements had been fulfilled. Not only was it within the Tribunal’s purview to decide that it was not a condition for the application of collateral estoppel that the claims against SM and Gass could have been brought in the Prior SIAC Arbitration, the Investors never argued that it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Further, while it is true that the Investors did not have the opportunity to pursue their claims against SM and Gass, this is beside the point. The collateral estoppel that the Tribunal accepted concerned issues common to the Prior SIAC Arbitration and to the dispute before it, as shown by the preclusion chart. The Investors had had the opportunity to run their case regarding those common issues in the Prior SIAC Arbitration. The effect of the finding of collateral estoppel was that the Investors could not reopen those matters, and this finding was based on the Tribunal’s view that SM and Gass were GOL’s privies for this purpose. Thus, the Investors did argue those common issues, but only once, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in the Prior SIAC Arbitration. There is nothing repugnant about their not being allowed to argue the same issues a second time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue B1: whether there was a breach of natural justice arising from the Tribunal’s reliance on the clarification of GOL’s Fee Arrangement only in the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51  To recap, the Investors say that they were taken by surprise when the Tribunal accepted the clarification in the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions that its obligation to pay costs over a certain fee cap was triggered so long as costs were awarded in their favour and there was no need for such costs to actually be collected. They complain that they did not have the opportunity to address this clarification made in GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The first difficulty in the Investors’ argument is that the issues of how much costs should be awarded and whether any award was to be limited by reason of funding arrangements were in play.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Tribunal afforded parties the opportunity to exchange two rounds of submissions (see above at [14]). It is not unexpected for reply submissions to clarify or refine a party’s position. Upon receipt of the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions, the Investors did not raise any issue about this allegedly belated assertion, make any request for disclosure or seek any further round of submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Secondly, and more fundamentally, the Investors have not fairly represented the Tribunal’s decision on this point. In fact, the Tribunal noted that GOL’s Fee Arrangement remained unclear, and included this lack of clarity as one of the factors that it bore in mind in allocating only 60% of the costs.

</div>
</div> Thus, it is not even correct that the Tribunal simply accepted what was said in the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions at face value. For the same reason, it cannot be said that the alleged breach of natural justice had prejudiced the Investors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue B2: whether the enforcement of the GOL Costs Order would be contrary to the laws and public policy of Singapore against maintenance and champerty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54  The Investors urge the court to find on the evidence before us that GOL’s Fee Arrangement is champertous and savours of maintenance. First, we do not accept that the concepts of champerty or maintenance are engaged by an agreement between a <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> and its lawyer that the defendant need only pay the lawyer’s costs above a certain fee cap to the extent that that defendant succeeded in its defence and obtained a costs order in its favour. Champerty and maintenance concern intermeddling that encourages lawsuits by financing them, and are not engaged where defence of a lawsuit is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Secondly, the arrangement as described is in form much like a conditional fee arrangement. Such arrangements are now permitted even for Singapore lawyers representing parties in international arbitrations: ss 115A(1) and 115B(1) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) read with reg 3(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Legal Profession (Conditional Fee Agreement) Regulations 2022. At the second reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill on 12 January 2022, the Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, noted that conditional fee arrangements “can also enhance access to justice”, and “can also discourage the pursuit of weak cases and frivolous claims”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (12 January 2022), vol 95 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Second Minister for Law).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It must be kept in mind that the Tribunal did not award an amount of costs that could by any measure be considered exorbitant, or not in keeping with the scope and scale of legal work done for the arbitration. We do not accept that GOL’s Fee Arrangement shocks the conscience or is otherwise contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue B3: whether the GOL Costs Order was contrary to parties’ agreed arbitral procedure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57  This issue turns on whether the GOL Costs Order did not fall within the Tribunal’s “authority to order in its Award that all or a part of the legal or other costs of a party be paid by another party”: Rule 37 of the SIAC Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Investors argue that the costs of a party must be costs that it has incurred in the sense of being obliged to pay. They say that to the extent that GOL was not obliged to pay costs above the fee cap then those excess costs could not be awarded by the Tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The parties agreed on the application of the SIAC Rules. The Tribunal did not disregard the SIAC Rules but followed those rules on the basis of its interpretation of them and its views and findings on the evidence before it. We do not agree that SIAC Rules Rule 37 is limited in the way contended for by the Investors. GOL engaged lawyers who incurred time in its defence. The value of that time spent forms part of GOL’s costs and so comes within Rule 37. Rule 37 vests arbitrators with a broad discretion to allocate and award costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue B4: whether the Tribunal exceeded the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration by awarding costs that have not been incurred by GOL in the GOL Costs Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60  This issue also depends on the Investors’ interpretation of Rule 37 as outlined in the preceding issue. We do not accept the Investors’ interpretation and thus reject the Investors’ contention under this head as well.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We dismiss OS 7 and SUM 5882.

The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (“<span class="font-weight-bold">GOL</span>”) was joined as the third respondent in 2018. SM, Gass and GOL are collectively referred to as the “<span class="font-weight-bold">GOL Parties</span>”. On 11 August 2021, the tribunal (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Tribunal</span>”) issued an award (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Award</span>”) dismissing the Investors’ claims in their entirety. The Investors filed applications to set aside the Award and to set aside an order of court which granted the GOL Parties leave to enforce the Award.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Sanum, a company incorporated in Macau, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LH, a Netherlands-incorporated company. Both invested in gaming assets (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Gaming Assets</span>”) in Laos.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Disputes arose between the Investors on the one hand and GOL on the other. To put an end to their disputes, parties entered into a settlement deed (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Settlement Deed</span>”) on 15 June 2014, pursuant to which the Investors agreed to sell the Gaming Assets to a third party by 15 April 2015, failing which a third-party gaming operator could be appointed. The Investors failed to do so by the stipulated date. GOL then entered into a contract with SM on 16 April 2015 for the management, sale and marketing of the Gaming Assets. That contract was signed by Gass, who was the President of SM.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Protracted legal battles continued between parties in multiple forums, one of which was SIAC Arbitration Case No. ARB 143/14/MV (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Prior SIAC Arbitration</span>”). In that proceeding, GOL and the Investors accused each other of breaching the Settlement Deed. It is noteworthy that SM and Gass were not parties in this arbitral proceeding. A final award was rendered on 29 June 2017 and enforced as a judgment of the Singapore court on 2 August 2019.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 SIAC Arbitration Case No. ARB 414/17/QW was commenced by the Investors on 19 December 2017, and it is this arbitral proceeding which gave rise to the Award in question. Here, the Investors asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and conversion of property against SM and Gass. GOL was joined as the third respondent in 2018.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On 11 August 2021, the Tribunal issued the Award dismissing the Investors’ claims against SM and Gass in their entirety. In particular, the Tribunal dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary and contractual duties, and a portion of the conversion claims (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Estopped Claims</span>”), on the basis that they were barred by the substantive defence of collateral estoppel under New York law in light of the issues raised in the Prior SIAC Arbitration. The remaining conversion claims were dismissed on separate grounds. As for costs, the Tribunal ordered the Investors to pay approximately 60% of GOL’s legal costs and disbursements (“<span class="font-weight-bold">GOL Costs Order</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 On 12 November 2021, the Investors filed SIC/OS 7/2022 to set aside the Award in its entirety or in part, on the basis that they were denied a reasonable opportunity to be heard on their claims against SM and Gass. This is because the Tribunal had, on the erroneous basis that the doctrine of collateral estoppel under New York law barred the Estopped Claims, failed to consider the merits of those claims. For this same reason, the Investors allege that the Award was in conflict with Singapore’s public policy of ensuring that parties to a dispute have fair access to justice.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 On 20 December 2021, the Investors filed HC/SUM 5882/2021 in SIC/OS 6/2022 to resist enforcement of the Award. In particular, the Investors resisted the enforcement of the GOL Costs Order on the following basis:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The Investors were unable to present their case on the GOL Costs Order. The Tribunal relied on a new assertion made in the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions regarding GOL’s fee arrangement with its counsel, and the Investors did not have an opportunity to address that point.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The enforcement of the GOL Costs Order would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. This is due to the aforementioned breach of their respective rights to be heard, as well as the fact that the GOL Costs Order was made pursuant to GOL’s fee arrangement with its counsel, which the Investors allege is champertous and savours of maintenance.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The GOL Costs Order was not in accordance with parties’ agreed arbitral procedure. Parties agreed to the application of rule 37 of the SIAC Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (6th edition, 1 August 2016) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SIAC Rules</span>”), which the Investors contend only permits the Tribunal to order costs which GOL has incurred, in the sense of having an obligation to pay. In contravention of this rule, the GOL Costs Order required the Investors to bear fees which GOL was not obliged to pay. For this same reason, the GOL Costs Order exceeded the scope of the submission to arbitration.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The Investors also sought orders for the anonymisation and redaction of parties’ identities.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court’s grounds of decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The court dismissed the Investors’ prayers for anonymisation and redaction of parties’ identities since the dispute was already in the public domain (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">19</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The Investors’ application to set aside the Award was dismissed:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The Investors’ respective rights to be heard were not breached. The applicability of the New York doctrine of collateral estoppel was an issue squarely before the Tribunal, and the Tribunal’s finding that this doctrine applied supplies a proper and reasonable basis for the Tribunal to not address the merits of the Estopped Claims. Whether the Tribunal made an error in its decision that the doctrine applied goes only to the merits and cannot found a challenge to the Award ([<span class="font-weight-bold">3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">41</span>]). Further, the mere fact that the Estopped Claims were precluded by the collateral estoppel doctrine cannot found a natural justice challenge: such preclusionary doctrines serve the cause of justice by promoting finality in litigation and their existence in most legal systems demonstrates that they are not in and of themselves objectionable (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">42</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">43</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The Award was not in conflict with Singapore’s public policy of access to justice. Amongst other reasons, the Investors did argue issues arising in this dispute in the Prior SIAC Arbitration. There is nothing repugnant about their not being allowed to argue the same issues a second time (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">50</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The Investors’ application to resist the enforcement of the Award was dismissed:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. There was no breach of natural justice arising from the Tribunal’s reliance on GOL’s assertion in the GOL Parties’ reply costs submissions. The issues of how much costs should be awarded and whether any award was to be limited by reason of funding arrangements were in play. There were two rounds of costs submissions, and the Investors did not raise any issue about this allegedly belated assertion or seek a further round of submissions. Furthermore, the alleged breach of natural justice would not have prejudiced the Investors (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">52</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">53]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The enforcement of the GOL Costs Order would not be contrary to the laws and public policy of Singapore against maintenance and champerty. Champerty and maintenance concern intermeddling that encourages lawsuits by financing them and are not engaged where defence of a lawsuit is concerned. Moreover, GOL’s fee arrangement with its counsel is akin to a conditional fee arrangement. Such arrangements are now permitted for Singapore lawyers representing parties in international arbitrations. Parliament has also recognised the policy benefits of such arrangements (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">54</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">55</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The GOL Costs Order was not contrary to parties’ agreed arbitral procedure, and neither did the Tribunal exceed the scope of parties’ submissions. Rule 37 of the SIAC Rules is not limited in the way contended for by the Investors.
