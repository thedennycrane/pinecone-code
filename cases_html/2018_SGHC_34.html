After he reached the carpark of the Block and found out that an Indian man had earlier slashed an Indian woman and fled the scene, he realised that he might have just seen the assailant and thus went to look for the assailant in his car. He next saw the assailant along Jurong West Avenue 1 and observed that a Chinese man was trying to stop the assailant from running away. He immediately approached the assailant. By then, the assailant had stopped running but was “very aggressive and hostile”. When Hanif asked the assailant what had happened, the Accused admitted to slashing the Indian girl because she had cheated on and had rejected him on a number of occasions.

According to Christopher, he was driving in the vicinity when he saw the Accused running along the road topless and a lady chasing after him shouting for him to stop. Christopher decided to give chase to the Accused. He thus stopped his car and pursued the Accused on foot. When the Accused saw Christopher, the Accused tried to run away but Christopher managed to catch up. Eventually, Christopher stopped the Accused and called the police hotline. He then told the Accused to sit down as the police were on their way. The Accused repeatedly told Christopher in English that he would go to the police station himself. A few minutes later, a Malay man (presumably Hanif) arrived and asked the Accused why he had hurt the girl. Christopher could not recall what the Accused’s response was. Until the arrival of the police, the Accused did not resist or try to escape.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This statement recorded first an open-ended recount by the Accused of the events from 19 to 20 December 2013. Briefly, amongst other things, the Accused recounted the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 19 December 2013, the Accused went to the Victim’s unit at around 11.00 am as he wanted to ask some questions about “what is the reason she is cheating on me”. When he reached the unit, the Victim called K, whom the Accused did not know but thought must be her new boyfriend. The Accused then spoke to the Victim’s father and told him that the Victim’s behaviour was not good and often changed boyfriends. K then appeared and accompanied the Accused down to the void deck of the Block, after which police officers arrived and advised the Accused to leave. Thereafter, the Accused consumed more alcohol and went back to his residence to sleep. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At around 7.00 pm on 19 December 2013, the Accused woke up and consumed alcohol, he then went to the kitchen and took a vegetable knife and put it inside the socks on his right leg. He then left his residence and bought and consumed more alcohol. The Accused then left for the Victim’s unit, intending to “cut my hand infront [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] of her so that she can change and realise how much I love her.” When he reached the Block at about 8 or 9 pm, he bought and consumed more alcohol. He later fell asleep at a nearby open air carpark. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The next morning at or about 5.00 am on 20 December 2013, the Accused woke up, drank more alcohol, made his way to the Block, and fell asleep at the void deck about 250 metres away from the lift of the Block.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At about 8.30 am in the morning, the Accused woke up and suddenly saw the Victim coming out of the lift walking towards him. He got up, ran to her, and held her hand, asking her why she had cheated him. He then said:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. … Both of us then had an argument with each other. I then became angry and lost my control. I then took the knife from my right side leg socks and started to slash her but I don’t know which area. She then fall on the floor and then get up again and said to me that she love me and will marry me but my parents won’t allow. She then kissed me on my lips and I saw a lot of blood coming out from her face. After that she collapsed on the floor. I then realised many blood flowing from the back of her hand. I then started to cry. I started looking for my knife as I wanted to kill myself, however, when I saw the knife, my knife’s top blade is already bended. I then tried to make it straight however, the [Victim’s] father came and push or kick me, I cannot remember… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. I admit using a knife and slashed [the Victim]. I did that because I was very sad and angry that she had cheated on me with some other guys, I really love her so much but she cheated on me. For me she is my life, and I want to marry her but unfortunately she cheated on me. At that point of time, I lost my control and I had hurt her. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) After a brief struggle between the Accused and the Victim’s father, the Accused managed to free himself. He saw the Victim’s handphone on the floor, took it, and ran across the road. He intended to go to a police station and he “took [the Victim’s] handphone as [he] wanted to show the police for the evidence that she is cheating me with another guy.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The statement then recorded three questions and the Accused’s responses to each question. The first set of question and answer is of particular significance: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Question 1:  Did you have the intention to kill her? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Answer 1:  Yes I want to kill her and after that I will kill myself, because she cheat me and at the same time, she is my life and I can’t erase her from my heart. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In Court, the Accused appeared to take the position that, even though the 2nd Statement recorded accurately what he had in fact told the recording officer, the contents of the 2nd Statement were not true.

</div> the Victim was initially given treatment by the Emergency Department of NUH. There, the Victim was found to have wounds on several areas of her body, including the head and neck, chest and abdomen, left and right upper limbs, and right lower limb areas. In view of her “multiple facial and neck lacerations”, the doctors decided to intubate the Victim to protect her airway. The Victim was also brought to the operating theatre for washout and debridement and closure of the wounds on the same day.

The Prosecution called Dr Stephen Phang (“Dr Phang”) who was a senior consultant psychiatrist attached to the department of general and forensic psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health. The Defence called Dr Jacob Rajesh (“Dr Rajesh”), who was acting in his capacity as a consultant psychiatrist at Promises Pte Ltd, a private psychiatric clinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Dr Phang produced two written reports in respect of the Accused’s mental state and was called to explain them as Prosecution’s witness during the Prosecution’s case. Dr Rajesh produced one written report but, when called during the Defence’s case, orally provided a further report which materially differed from his first written report. Thus, after Dr Rajesh gave his evidence, the Prosecution applied to recall Dr Phang as a rebuttal witness in respect of certain issues raised by Dr Rajesh. I granted the application for reasons to be elaborated on below (at [112] to [123]). The evidence provided by the two experts will also be detailed below at the suitable juncture (at [153] to [266]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Prosecution’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In relation to the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of the offence, the Prosecution’s case was that the Accused had the capacity to form intention, and in fact had the requisite intention to kill the Victim under s 307(1) of the PC, at the material time of the alleged offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of the offence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fact that the Accused had stabbed the Victim and caused the injuries stated in the Charge) was not disputed.

The present case is not one involving minors or sexual offences such that other provisions concerning the prohibition of publication of the victim’s details do not apply (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, s 35 of the Children and Young Person’s Act and s 153(4) of the Women’s Charter). However, s 8(3) of the SCJA provides a residual power to the Court to grant a gag order where it considers appropriate. The Prosecution cited <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lydiawaty binte Abdul Rahman</span> (MAC-906236-2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Lydiawaty</span>”) as an example of a case where a gag order was granted in a case of violent nature even though minors and sexual offences were not involved. In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that given the Victim’s fragile emotional state and the intensive media attention that the case had received, she should be spared from further trauma arising from media scrutiny into her personal life. From a broader perspective, it is also in the interests of justice that victims be unafraid to testify in Court against any kind of offence.

</div> the concerns are likely to have been misplaced. The Courts will have ultimate control over the conduct of proceedings, and will need to be persuaded on the balance of interests. In the present case, it was not disputed that the existence and extent of an allegedly intimate relationship between the Accused and the Victim were issues that were going to be contested during the trial. Therefore, balancing the non-apparent benefit that could be derived from the identification of the Victim, against the distress that may be revisited upon the Victim given the probable intense scrutiny of her past decisions by the media and the public, and against the possible deterrence of other victims in similar situations from reporting offences and testifying against other accused persons, I was of the view that a gag order would be appropriate in this case. In my view, even though this case did not strictly speaking involve a sexual offence, it invoked similar concerns. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Fourthly, the Defence did not suggest that the gag order would in any way prejudice the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rebuttal witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Dr Rajesh was the last witness called by the Defence. At the close of the Defence’s case, the Prosecution applied to recall Dr Phang as a rebuttal witness in respect of (a) Dr Rajesh’s diagnosis that the Accused suffered from acute stress disorder at the material time of the alleged offence, and (b) Dr Rajesh’s opinion that, due to the acute stress disorder, the Accused lacked the capacity to form intention at that time. Apparently, both these points only became known to the Prosecution when Dr Rajesh gave evidence on the stand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In this regard, the Prosecution relied on s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), which stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedure at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">230.—(1)  The following procedure must be complied with at the trial in all courts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) […]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) at the close of the defence case, the prosecution shall have the right to call a person as a witness or recall and re-examine a person already examined, for the purpose of rebuttal, and such witness may be cross-examined by the accused and every co-accused, after which the prosecutor may re-examine him;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In addition, the Prosecution also cited <span class="font-italic">Zainal Bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian Michael </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) for the proposition that the plaintiff would be allowed to call rebuttal evidence against the defence if the plaintiff was misled or taken by surprise (at [38]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 It is true that a discretion lies with the trial judge to allow the plaintiff to call evidence to rebut evidence of the defence: <span class="font-italic">Williams v Davies</span> (1833) 1 Cr &amp; M 464; 149 ER 481.

First, it was the Court’s discretion to determine the necessity of the rebuttal evidence. In this case, the Defence maintained that they had not raised anything which surprised the Prosecution. Dr Rajesh’s evidence concerning acute stress disorder/reaction was merely an agreement with Dr Phang’s diagnosis of acute stress reaction. Secondly, the Defence submitted that s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) of the CPC was designed to deal with the adduction of rebuttal evidence to prove or disprove factual evidence and not expert evidence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I granted the Prosecution’s application. Based on the language of s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) of the CPC, it appeared that the Prosecution had a <span class="font-italic">right </span>to call a rebuttal witness at the close of the Defence’s case. If this “right” was read in the absolute sense of the word, it would suggest that the Prosecution was entitled to call Dr Phang as a rebuttal witness, regardless of the Defence’s objections, and whether or not the Court may have agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 However, it was not clear whether the “right” to call a rebuttal witness under s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) of the CPC was subject to the overriding discretion of the Court. It has been said that “[a]s [s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>)] does no more than statutorily enshrine the prevailing practice hitherto, the <span class="font-italic">corpus</span> of jurisprudence that has developed thus far would apply” (Jennifer Marie and Mohamed Faizal, <span class="font-italic">The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 12.060). In this regard, case law prior to the 2012 edition of the CPC suggested that the Court had an overriding discretion as to whether to grant an application to call a rebuttal witness (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Azman bin Jamaludin v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 1 SLR 615; <span class="font-italic">Yap Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 855; <span class="font-italic">Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 936). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Section 283(1) of the CPC appears to affirm the Court’s discretion whether to allow a party to recall a witness at the end of the Defence’s case. For context, s 283 of the CPC states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power of court to summon and examine persons</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">283.—(1)  A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code, summon a person as a witness or examine a person in attendance as a witness, whether or not summoned, or recall and re-examine a person already examined.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The court must summon and examine or recall and re-examine such a person if it thinks his evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The exercise by a court of its power under subsection (1) is not a ground for appeal, or for revision, unless the appellant, or the applicant, as the case may be, shows that the examination has led to a failure of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the interaction between s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) and s 283 of the CPC was not an issue before me, I say no more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In any event, for the purposes of the present case, both the Prosecution and the Defence appeared to agree that the Court had a discretion as to whether or not to allow the Prosecution’s application to call a rebuttal witness. In particular, the Prosecution did not assert an unfettered right to call Dr Phang as a rebuttal witness.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Therefore, even if the Court had an overriding discretion as to whether to grant the Prosecution’s application to recall a rebuttal witness, I was of the view that the Prosecution’s application in this case should be allowed. In my view, Dr Rajesh’s testimony in Court regarding acute stress disorder/reaction and the consequential lack of capacity to form intention on the part of the Accused was not adequately foreshadowed by Dr Rajesh’s 1st Report or any other evidence, and the Prosecution could not have reasonably anticipated such evidence being given by Dr Rajesh.

The Defence elected not to contend with the law, and instead focussed its closing submissions on the facts of the present case. The Prosecution made brief submissions on the proper construction of s 307 in their closing submissions based on academic commentary and foreign case law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mens rea</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> under s 307 of the PC is encapsulated by the phrase “such intention or knowledge… that… he would be guilty of murder”. This phrase ties the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of attempted murder under s 307 of the PC to the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of the offence of murder under s 300 of the PC. Therefore, for both s 307 (attempted murder) and s 300 (murder) of the PC, there are four alternative limbs of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>, which may be summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) intention to cause death (s 300(a)); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) intention to cause such bodily injury as the accused knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused (s 300(b)); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) intention to cause bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death (s 300(c));</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) knowledge that his act is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death (s 300(d)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Prosecution’s primary case was that the Accused had, at the material time, an intention to kill the Victim (which I take to be synonymous with an intention to cause her death). However, the Prosecution also cited the alternative <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>limbs of ss 300(b) and (d) in their closing submissions.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Insofar as these alternative limbs are concerned, two observations are due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 First, based on this four-limbed approach which equates <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 307 of the PC to that under s 300 of the PC, an intention to cause death (or, which I take as synonymous, an intention to kill) is only one of four alternative limbs of <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>that would satisfy s 307. While there may be Indian cases suggesting that an intention to kill is the <span class="font-italic">only </span>limb of <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> that could satisfy s 307 of the PC (see <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">YMC</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”) </span>at para 36.36), I am doubtful if that reading of s 307 can be accommodated by the language of the provision. In any event, as will be explained, it is not necessary to rely on the alternative limbs of <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Secondly, the four-limbed approach to <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>under s 307 of the PC may result in inconsistency with the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement under the general attempt provision of s 511 of the PC. This is because, unlike the four limbs of <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for s 307, s 511 of the PC generally requires an intention to commit the substantive offence with which s 511 is read (see <span class="font-italic">Mas Swan bin Adnan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 527 (“<span class="font-italic">Mas Swan</span>”) at [33]). This, however, is not an insurmountable difficulty. As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ketmuang Banphanuk and another </span>[1995] SGHC 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Ketmuang</span>”), “[f]or offences where the legislative provides for specific definitions of attempt [such as s 307 of the PC], the general definition [under s 511 of the PC] will not apply”. This observation by the High Court was left undisturbed on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Actus reus</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The requisite <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>under s 307 of the PC is captured by the phrase “does any act… under such circumstances that if he by that act caused death he would be guilty of murder”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 There may be some difficulty in delineating the extent to which the accused must have embarked on the crime in order for criminal liability under s 307 of the PC to be imposed. Generally, there are at least five possible approaches to the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of attempted offences (<span class="font-italic">YMC</span> at paras 36.17–36.22): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Proximity test</span>: The accused must have done some overt act which is directed towards the actual commission of the crime and which is immediately and not remotely connected with the crime. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Last act test</span>: The accused must have done all the acts which he believed to be necessary to commit the substantive offence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">Apparent intention test</span>: The accused must have conducted himself in a manner which indicates in itself a clear and unequivocal intention to commit the offence.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold">Substantial step test</span>: The accused must have progressed a substantial way towards the completion of the offence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-weight-bold">Embarked on the crime proper test</span>: The offender must have “embarked on the crime proper”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In this regard, it should be noted that there are several provisions under the PC for attempt-related offences. Insofar as s 307 of the PC provides for the offence of attempted murder (and s 308 of the PC provides for attempted culpable homicide), these are <span class="font-italic">specific</span> provisions for the <span class="font-italic">attempt of particular offences</span>, whereas the <span class="font-italic">general</span> attempt provision is s 511 of the PC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In its closing submissions, the Prosecution appears to suggest that the apparent intention test should apply. Citing a leading Indian text, the Prosecution submitted, under a section titled “<span class="font-italic">actus reus</span>”, that “the focus would nevertheless return back to the intention or knowledge motivating such an act, which could be inferred from the circumstances” (see C K Thakker &amp; M C Thakker eds, <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal’s</span> <span class="font-italic">Law of Crimes</span><span class="font-italic">, A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Volume Two </span>(26th ed, Bharat Law House, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span>”) at p 1804).

</div> Insofar as the apparent intention test is concerned, the leading local text states that the question is whether a person observing the conduct of the accused in video form without sound must decide that the accused was attempting to commit the offence charged; evidence that cannot be considered within this rubric, such as confessions and statements, is irrelevant (<span class="font-italic">YMC </span>at para 36.20).<span class="font-italic"> </span>The Defence made no submissions on this issue of the requisite <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus </span>under s 307 of the PC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 On the other hand, the illustrations to s 307 of the PC suggest that the “last act” test applies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 It is not necessary for me to reach a conclusive view on the appropriate <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>test to be adopted in relation to s 307.

This issue begs three premises of fact and expert opinion, which I briefly discuss before delving into the four substantive issues set out above: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there was in fact a wallpaper on the Victim’s handphone at the material time that depicted the Victim in an embrace with K; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the Accused in fact saw the Victim’s wallpaper at the material time; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) what impact, if any, did the wallpaper have on the Accused’s state of mind when the Accused beheld it at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The first question relates to the existence of the wallpaper as alleged by the Accused. This forms the premise of the entire analysis on the Accused’s <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> at the material time and the satisfaction of the partial defence of provocation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 There was some subjective evidence before the Court as to the existence and depiction of the said wallpaper. The Accused testified under cross-examination that, immediately prior to the commission of the alleged offence, he had seen a wallpaper on the Victim’s handphone which was a photo of the Victim with K, where K’s left arm was around the Victim’s shoulder, as if they were hugging while facing each other.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 At this point, some discussion about the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s respective burdens of proof is apposite. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Although the Prosecution bears the legal burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had, at the material time, the capacity to form intent, the Defence bears the evidential burden to put the Accused’s (in)capacity to form intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the material time into issue. The distinction between a legal and an evidential burden of proof was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) (at [58]) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 The term ‘burden of proof’ is more properly used with reference to the obligation to prove. There are in fact two kinds of burden in relation to the adduction of evidence. The first, designated the legal burden of proof, is, properly speaking, a burden of proof, for it describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists. The obligation never shifts in respect of any fact, and only ‘shifts’ in a manner of loose terminology when a legal presumption operates. The second is a burden of proof only loosely speaking, for it falls short of an obligation to prove that a particular fact exists. It is more accurately designated the evidential burden to produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some evidence, whether in propounding or rebutting, will mean a failure to engage the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep this question alive. As such, this burden can and will shift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The concept of an evidential burden of proof is not expressly provided for in the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), but it nevertheless exists in local jurisprudence “in the form of a tactical onus to contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence that has been led…” (<span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale </span><span class="font-italic">Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International) v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In the present case, I am of the view that the Defence bears the evidential burden to produce sufficient evidence to engage the issue of the Accused’s (in)capacity to form intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the material time. This entails, more specifically, the production of evidence to engage each of the abovementioned three premises to the issue (see [137] above), since a failure to engage any of these premises would necessarily and logically mean a failure to engage the issue itself, unless any premise is conceded by the Prosecution. If in the end the Defence fails to pass its evidential burden, it would “mean a failure to engage the question of the existence of a particular fact [of capacity to form intent] or to keep this question alive” (see quotation above of <span class="font-italic">Britestone </span>at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I return now to the first premise that the wallpaper existed as described by the Accused. In this regard, the Defence could have passed its evidential burden by adducing the wallpaper itself. It did not do so, electing instead to rely on the Accused’s testimony on the existence and depiction of the wallpaper. The Defence may have been entitled to so elect, but it is a separate question whether or not that was to its strategic advantage. The Defence did not complain that it lacked access to the Victim’s handphone before or during the conduct of the trial. Even if the handphone was in the possession of the police, the Defence could have asked for the wallpaper to be produced or for access to the handphone to produce the wallpaper. At least based on the court’s record, it appears that this had not been done. The Defence also did not assert that the Prosecution had been in breach of any duty of disclosure. Therefore, the Defence’s accusation of unfair investigation by the Prosecution is not justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Having said that, I am prepared to accept at face value the Accused’s allegation that a wallpaper depicting the Victim and K in an embrace existed on the Victim’s handphone at the material time. In the course of the trial and in its closing submissions, the Prosecution did not challenge the existence of the wallpaper as such and appeared to proceed on the basis that it did exist. Since both the Prosecution and the Defence were prepared to proceed on this basis, I will assume the same even though it is regrettable that the wallpaper (if it existed) was not eventually adduced.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I turn next to the second premise that the Accused had sight of the alleged wallpaper at the material time. Again, I am of the view that the Defence bears the evidential burden to produce sufficient evidence to engage this fact, without which the issue of the Accused’s (in)capacity to form intention<span class="font-italic"> </span>cannot logically arise. In this regard, the Accused testified that he had caught sight of the wallpaper at around the time the Victim received and cut off a phone call.

Seeing this, the Accused “lost [his] head”. He did not know what happened next and did not remember stabbing the Victim. The next thing he realised was that she was tugging at his shirt and said “I only desire to marry you, but my parents are objecting, I saw she was bleeding… I saw even blood flowing out from her eyes… she kissed me on my lips”. Once he saw that she was hurt, he beat his forehead and started crying. He wanted to stab himself but realised the knife was bent. While he attempted to straighten it, the Victim’s father came and assaulted him. The Accused ran away, looking for a nearby police station to surrender.

</div> While it is correct that such evidence could be given orally, it should have been given in a written form and a copy made available to the other party to avoid any surprise. This is particularly so when, as was the case here, the oral testimony concerned an important contention. Indeed, the Prosecution, perhaps taken by surprise by Dr Rajesh’s new evidence, applied to recall Dr Phang as a rebuttal witness after Dr Rajesh gave his evidence. That invited in turn the Defence’s application to call Dr Rajesh in surrebuttal, even though that application was eventually not pursued.

To this end, I note that Dr Rajesh was not able to explain adequately why he had decided to conduct a third interview with the Accused in January 2017 and to come up with his 2nd Report which was materially different from his 1st Report. In his 1st Report, Dr Rajesh had found that the Accused was not suffering from unsoundness of mind and had the capacity to form intent.

</div> At that time, Dr Rajesh did not mention acute stress reaction or acute stress disorder. His diagnosis was moderate depression instead (see [164] above). Yet, in his 2nd Report, Dr Rajesh took an entirely different approach and diagnosed a full-blown “acute stress disorder” (under the DSM-V) which so seriously affected the Accused that it negated his capacity to form intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 According to Dr Rajesh, he was triggered to have a third interview with the Accused and to prepare his 2nd Report because he had noticed that Dr Phang’s 2nd report used stronger language about the existence of acute stress disorder/reaction than Dr Phang’s 1st Report. In Dr Phang’s 1st Report, Dr Phang said that there was “quite possibly an element of acute stress reaction, particularly when he beheld the wallpaper picture… for the first time”.

First, in his view, the omission of the words “an element of” in the later report was significant. Dr Rajesh appeared to be implying that the omission suggested the likelihood of acute stress reaction in the Accused (in the ICD-10 sense). In both reports, Dr Phang had used the term “acute stress reaction”. In Dr Rajesh’s words, Dr Phang is a “very experienced psychiatrist” and his use of that term alluded to the ICD-10 condition of “acute stress reaction”, which is itself a psychiatric disorder.

Thus, in Dr Rajesh’s view, Dr Phang was more certain about the existence of acute stress reaction (in the ICD-10 sense) in his 2nd Report than in his 1st Report.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 I address the second reason first. It is obvious that any relevant mental reaction or disorder noted by an expert for a criminal case must be present at the “critical moment” of the alleged offence. Otherwise, that mental condition would be immaterial, if not irrelevant, to the conviction of the accused. The reference to the critical moment in Dr Phang’s 2nd Report was clearly not an additional or independent reason or finding put forth by Dr Phang, but simply part of his overall opinion. I do not see how that could have suggested a shift in Dr Phang’s opinion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I come back to Dr Rajesh’s first reason. While he focussed on paragraph 15 of Dr Phang’s 2nd Report, he did not mention paragraph 8 of the same report, which states: “While there was quite possibly an element of acute stress reaction, particularly when he beheld the wallpaper picture of the alleged victim and [K] for the very first time, I am persuaded that he was incensed, rather than insane, and consequentially committed the said alleged offence”.

</div> Nevertheless, it must have been obvious to any reasonable expert reading both of Dr Phang’s reports that Dr Phang was not making any significant change in emphasis in his 2nd Report. It must also have been obvious that Dr Phang was not suggesting any serious mental condition or disorder on the part of the Accused at the material time of the alleged offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Furthermore, the possibility of an element of “acute stress reaction” (whether or not in the ICD-10 sense) was already mentioned in Dr Phang’s 1st Report. Being an expert, Dr Rajesh could not have overlooked that when he prepared his 1st Report. Indeed, he did not say that he had overlooked this. So, he must already have taken this into account when he interviewed the Accused twice before issuing his 1st Report. If he truly believed that Dr Phang’s 1st Report was referring to acute stress reaction in the ICD-10 sense, and if it was his own opinion that the Accused had been suffering from acute stress reaction in the ICD-10 sense and/or acute stress disorder in the DSM-V sense, then, after his first two interviews with the Accused, his 1st Report would have reflected that opinion. Yet, Dr Rajesh’s 1st Report did not mention that the Accused suffered from either of these mental conditions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, acute stress reaction in the ICD-10 sense or acute stress disorder in the DSM-V sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Something had caused Dr Rajesh to reconsider his 1st Report. It may have been because Dr Rajesh was subsequently shown (after issuing his 1st Report) various written statements of the Accused to the police, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1st to 4th Statements, in which the Accused appeared to admit that he did intend to kill the Victim. Whatever the real reason, it was clearly not Dr Phang’s 2nd Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Another reason that Dr Rajesh initially proffered for his change in position was that he had re-clarified the symptoms of acute stress disorder/reaction with the Accused during their third interview in January 2017. Yet, when he was pressed during cross-examination as to what new information he had received from his third interview, he was evasive. At some point, he even said that he “[did not] change any diagnosis” between his two reports.

He could form and act on a belief that it would be better for him to straighten the tip of the knife before committing suicide. He could also crystallise an intention to turn himself in to the police, and direct his mind to the evidence necessary to prove the Victim’s infidelity despite the chaotic situation that he must have been in. These facts are inconsistent with the Defence’s case that the Accused had no capacity to form intent. Thus, the more persuasive view was Dr Phang’s – that the Accused’s claim to have forgotten how and how many times he had stabbed the Victim must have been “selective amnesia which is fundamentally not genuine amnesia at all”.

</div> However, that was precisely Dr Phang’s point: the Accused was practicing “selective amnesia” in an attempt to buttress his defence. Dr Rajesh’s testimony did not offer any other reason why the Accused could have so coincidentally lost awareness or recollection of the details of the immediate attack but still been aware of and remember much of the details which immediately precede and follow that short period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Secondly, Dr Phang’s evaluation had an advantage over Dr Rajesh’s: Dr Phang’s interviews of the Accused and his assessment of the Accused’s mental state were far more contemporaneous than Dr Rajesh’s. In this regard, it was not disputed by either expert that the closer the time of the assessment to the time of the incident, the more accurate the assessment <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Accused’s mental state at the time of the incident is likely to be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Initially, Dr Rajesh opined that even though he had assessed the Accused at a later date compared to Dr Phang, that was not a major limitation because psychiatric diagnoses are in any event based on retrospective information collection and discernment of the Accused’s symptoms.

As far as acute stress disorder/reaction is concerned, it is important to have the opportunity to observe the patient’s conduct and demeanour very soon after the alleged offence since, by Dr Rajesh’s own evidence, acute stress disorder/reaction is a “short-lived episode” which symptoms only last for up to a few days.

</div> I accept that a checklist approach might be too mechanistic. However, as I understand Dr Phang’s evidence, psychiatric diagnosis is not a free-for-all and it is “intelligent flexibility” that is permitted. For example, if the diagnostic criteria requires five out of nine symptoms and the patient only shows four but those four symptoms are “so prominent and have caused so much dysfunction to the individual’s life, you can still diagnose it even if he does not meet the strict five out of nine”.

As Dr Phang explained, even if he had asked and the Accused had responded in the positive, his opinion would have remained the same. Further, I see some force in Dr Phang’s observation that if the Accused had in fact been suffering from distressing flashbacks, that would have been apparent to a trained psychiatrist observing him at that time. I am also not persuaded by the Accused’s apparent reason for not reporting his alleged distressing flashbacks to anyone while being remanded in the Changi Medical Centre. The Accused explained that he had kept silent because he was not sure how and by what process he could report his flashbacks to someone (see [214] above). However, his remand in the Changi Medical Centre coincided with the period when Dr Phang was assessing him regarding his mental state.

For instance, Dr Phang testified that he put the word “supposedly” in paragraph 8 of Dr Phang’s 1st Report because this was what was told to him and he had no way of verifying it one way or the other: “That’s why I added the word in parenthesis.”

</div> As another example, Dr Phang explained that he had added the word “interestingly” in the sentence “Interestingly enough, he agreed that he did not have a wrist watch then but was still able to keep reasonable track of the passage of time” because he was of an older generation who tended to use wrist watches to keep time rather than handphones.

In my view, Dr Phang’s language does not bring his neutrality into question. In this regard, although language is one potential indicator of partiality, the Courts should be slow to police the tone, word choice, or writing style of experts. Strong language, verbosity, a conversational or a terse and concise style are often matters of personal preference and habit rather than evidence of partiality. Rather, partiality of experts may be better assessed through an examination of the expert’s reasons and logical rigour. For instance, an inexplicable leap of logic in favour of a particular party would suggest partiality and raise a red flag. Nothing of that sort was present to suggest that Dr Phang’s 1st and 2nd Reports, or his testimony in Court, were influenced by partiality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Further, the fact that Dr Phang had recorded down his observations as to the Accused’s conduct and traits during their interviews did not in itself mean that he was partial or lacked independence. One complaint raised by the Defence was that Dr Phang had stated in Dr Phang’s 1st Report that the Accused was “unnecessarily verbose and over-inclusive”, even though the Accused could only speak in Tamil and simple English, and Dr Phang could only understand the former through interpretation.

</div> However, one does not necessarily need to understand a foreign language in order to be able to opine that a foreign language speaker was verbose. The fact that Dr Phang recorded his view that the Accused was verbose thus does not mean that he lacked neutrality. I add that I am also of the view that the Accused was verbose when he was giving evidence orally in Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 For the abovementioned reasons, I find that the Accused did not suffer from “acute stress disorder” (under the DSM-V) or “acute stress reaction” (under ICD-10) at the material time and therefore was not deprived of his capacity to form intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>by virtue of such a condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Finally, I note that significant time in Court was spent on eliciting the experts’ opinion on the relative merits of the DSM-V and the ICD-10, and their popularity in different parts of the world.

First, even though he had the title of healthcare assistant, his actual duties were mechanical, repetitive, and unskilled, such as cleaning the floor, making the bed, and serving food. Depression affects cognitive functions such as memory, concentration, rational decision-making, and not the performance of manual or unskilled work. Dr Rajesh gave an example of security guards, some of whom apparently have mental disorders but are still able to do their work as security guards because it does not involve higher thinking.

</div> Thirdly, the Accused’s work performance may not be satisfactory as Ms Wong made it out to appear.

</div> The impression that the Court initially got from Dr Rajesh’s evidence was that the Accused had consulted Dr Venkatesan through the intermediary of a general medical practitioner in India. Dr Rajesh further testified that he personally knew Dr Venkatesan because they had trained together.

</div> As Dr Phang pointed out in his rebuttal evidence, if this had been the case, it would be a curious omission for Dr Rajesh not to have contacted Dr Venkatesan directly to find out what exactly he had diagnosed of the Accused and the reasons for his prescribing amitriptyline in June 2013.

</div> This led to an interesting assertion made by counsel for the Defence in his application to recall Dr Rajesh as a surrebuttal witness (see [123] above). Counsel said that although the Accused’s mother had asked the Accused to see Dr Venkatesan, the general medical practitioner whom the Accused consulted in fact spoke to some other psychiatrist who was not Dr Venkatesan.

</div> Counsel initially wanted to recall Dr Rajesh as a witness to provide this clarification, but did not pursue this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 Even if I were to accept that the general medical practitioner did not consult Dr Venkatesan, the point is that Dr Rajesh’s initial evidence gave a contrary impression. Indeed, that was the apparent purpose why Dr Rajesh went to some length to elaborate as to who Dr Venkatesan was and his qualifications and acquaintance with Dr Rajesh. If the Accused had been recommended to consult Dr Venkatesan but did not do so, whether directly or indirectly, then there would have been no reason to elaborate about Dr Venkatesan. It was incumbent on Dr Rajesh to make it clear that Dr Venkatesan was never consulted either directly or indirectly when he mentioned Dr Venkatesan’s name. The fact that Dr Rajesh did not make that clear, and instead elaborated about Dr Venkatesan and his background, raised a question about the reliability of his expert evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 Alternatively, if in fact the general medical practitioner did consult Dr Venkatesan, but Dr Rajesh omitted to contact Dr Venkatesan directly to find out what he had diagnosed of the Accused, then the allegation that the Accused was diagnosed by a psychiatrist to be depressed would have been suspect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Secondly, the Accused’s mother was illiterate. Dr Rajesh himself said that she might not be able to explain what “depression” meant.

</div> Yet, it was alleged that she was able to suggest to the Accused to consult a psychiatrist by the name of Dr Venkatesan. It appears that Dr Rajesh did not question how the mother knew enough to make the recommendation. Two other points are of note here. One, the mother was not independent and she would have been inclined to say to Dr Rajesh whatever that is protective of her son.

The Accused’s answer to Dr Phang’s question was that he had not.

</div> The Accused mentioned his mother’s alleged recommendation and how he had indirectly consulted a psychiatrist while in India only when he was interviewed by Dr Rajesh much later. I am of the view that if this additional information was true, the Accused would have mentioned it to Dr Phang in response to Dr Phang’s explicit question as to whether he had consulted a psychiatrist. His omission suggested that the additional information given subsequently to Dr Rajesh was an untrue embellishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 In the circumstances, I am of the view that the supervisors’ observation of the Accused’s behaviour would be more reliable. As Dr Phang also explained, their proximity with the Accused on a day to day basis would give “a far more acute reflection of [the Accused’s] mental state” than the Accused’s mother in India with whom the Accused met only for a short period in June 2013.

</div> In the course of the trial, questions arose as to why the Indian psychiatrist prescribed only 25mg of amitriptyline. Dr Phang testified that this dosage was too low to indicate a diagnosis of clinical depression, and so the medication may have been prescribed for insomnia instead. Dr Rajesh explained that prescribing a low dosage of amitriptyline is professional clinical practice, because amitriptyline is a “very old antidepressant” and has several side effects, so no psychiatrist will prescribe a high dosage from the start. However, Dr Rajesh did not say that the dosage of amitriptyline prescribed should not be considered “low”, or that it could not have been given as treatment for insomnia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In the absence of further evidence from the doctor who prescribed the medicine, the bare fact that amitriptyline of a low dosage was prescribed for the Accused is neither here nor there. In fact, Dr Rajesh himself stated that amitriptyline was not a medication used exclusively for clinical depression; it can also be used for migraines and irritable bowel syndromes.

At that level, the Accused was in the “excitement” stage of alcoholic influence, with symptoms being “[e]motional instability, loss of critical judgment, impairment of perception, memory, and comprehension.

On the assumption that the Accused had consumed 9 cans of beer, and that each can of beer has about 15mg of alcohol (which was the unchallenged assumption used by Dr Rajesh), that would give around 135mg of alcohol which was only about half the blood alcohol concentration that Dr Rajesh has calculated using his estimate of 17 cans of beer consumed.

</div>
</div>
</div> There was no challenge as to the admissibility or voluntariness of these statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 In my view, the Accused’s 1st to 4th Statements reinforce the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had the intention to kill the Victim at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 1st Statement was recorded soon after the alleged offence and stated that “I want to kill her and kill me. I stab my wife because she cheating on me. She cheat me many times. I am upset and angry” (see [66] above). Here, the Accused expressly admitted to an intention to kill the Victim, and his attempt to justify his conduct by reference to the Victim’s infidelity suggests that he had attacked the Victim with deliberateness and consciousness rather than as a result of dissociation or loss of control or awareness.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 2nd Statement expressly conceded an intention to kill the Victim. Question 1 to the statement asked “Did you have the intention to kill [the Victim]?”, to which the Accused responded “Yes I want to kill her and after that I will kill myself, because she cheat me and at the same time, she is my life…” (see [70] above). Question 2 followed up with “Are you telling the truth?” to which the Accused responded “Yes”. Thus, even if Question 1 was a reference to what the Accused had earlier stated in his 1st Statement, the Accused’s response to Question 2 constituted a fresh admission of his intention to kill. There was a reference to the Victim’s handphone as containing evidence of the Victim’s infidelity, but no specific reference to the wallpaper. I will say more on this later. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The 3rd Statement stated that “Because she cheat me sir, she play with my feelings, sir…” (see [73] above). The Accused did not say that he did not know why or how he had attacked the Victim, or that he had lost awareness or control of himself. There is also no mention of the Victim’s wallpaper. This suggests that the Accused had in fact formed the intention to kill the Victim, albeit he was trying to justify his conduct <span class="font-italic">ex post</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The 4th Statement expressly conceded to an intention to kill the Victim. It was also the first mention of the Victim’s wallpaper: “My first intention is to go and find her and to kill myself but after I see the picture on her handphone, I then want to kill her and after that kill myself” (see [77] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 The statements do mention the Accused’s concurrent intention to commit suicide. However, as I discuss below, even if that is taken at face value, an intention to commit suicide is not inconsistent with an intention to kill the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 Further, I note that the 5th Statement denied an intention to kill the Victim, but this was an outlier and it was taken in 2015, which was around two years after the date of the 4th Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 The Accused explained that he had given the 1st to 4th Statements because he was confused and did not want to live. I do not accept this excuse. The implication that the Accused intended to kill the Victim because she had been cheating on him is clear and consistent throughout the 1st to 4th Statements. Further, the 2nd and the 4th Statements were fairly detailed and did not suggest any deficiency in the Accused’s ability to think, recollect, or respond. It was also Dr Rajesh’s evidence that by 9.25 pm on 20 December 2013 which was the time the 2nd Statement was taken, the Accused’s blood alcohol concentration level would have been zero.

In my view, the nature of the Victim’s injuries and the manner of the Accused’s attack do not necessarily support the proposition that the Accused was deprived of capacity to form intent<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the material time. In this regard, the Defence cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>, where the Court had observed in relation to the partial defence of provocation (at [41]):<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 The fact that multiple injuries were inflicted in an entirely random and frenzied manner all over the deceased’s body also suggests that the accused had suddenly lost self-control. As mentioned earlier (see [26] above), there were 15 external injuries over various parts of her body. In his statement to the police dated 14 July 2008, the accused stated thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After the first stab, I closed my eyes and I started to swing and stab her several times. I do not know how many times I did this. I could not remember clearly what I had done. My mind went blank at that moment. At times, I could feel that the knife I was holding hit onto something but at times, I felt that I was swinging my hand in the air.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Presumably, the Defence’s point was that the number and nature of the injuries in our case, analogous to that in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>, suggested that the Accused lacked capacity to form intention. I do not agree. In my view, there is no general proposition that the infliction of multiple injuries in an apparently random and frenzied manner would mean that the accused lacked of self-control or capacity to form intent. Much would depend on the particular facts. The infliction of multiple, random, and frenzied injuries could be evidence of the senseless conduct of an accused who has lost all self-control, or it could be equally consistent with the result of an attack by an accused who had, with consciousness and control over his mental faculties, engaged in a struggle or scuffle with the victim in his bid to kill that victim (see also <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sundarti Supriyanto </span>[2004] 4 SLR 622 at [152]). Therefore, <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>is better construed as a context-specific example, rather than a general proposition that accused persons who inflict multiple, random, and frenzied injuries lack self-control or capacity to form intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 In the present case, the nature of the injuries sustained by the Victim could be explained by reasons other than the Accused’s loss of capacity to form intent. For one, it was undisputed that the Victim had struggled with the Accused at the material time of the incident in a natural bid to protect herself from further injury. The effect of her struggle could make the injuries she suffered appear to be inflicted in a frenzied manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 I have set out above my reasons for concluding that the Accused had the capacity to form intent at the material time and that he did in fact have that intent. In addition, I am of the view the number and nature of the injuries, as well as the manner of the Accused’s attack on the Victim, reinforces my view that the Accused intended at the material time to kill the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 Looking at the injuries suffered by the Victim (see [285] above), the Accused had struck repeatedly, relentlessly, and forcefully at several parts of the Victim’s body, including her head and neck region which are vulnerable. The Accused initiated his attack against the Victim while she was standing, and continued to strike at her even after she had fallen to the ground. By the Accused’s own account, he must have used significant force as he had caused the tip of the knife blade to bend when he missed a strike and the knife hit the floor. Even until the Victim’s father came to the Victim’s aid at the scene, the Accused was positioned on top of the Victim with a knife and was about to strike at the Victim.

</div> They argued that the Accused was not truthful about the emotions that he held towards the Victim at or around the time of the offence in late 2013. By the Prosecution’s case, the Accused was “aggrieved” by the Victim’s perceived infidelity and was “upset at the victim” after having been repeatedly rebuffed in his marriage proposals.

The apparent intention test, as submitted by the Prosecution, is also satisfied because of the manner in which the Accused had attacked the Victim. Further, the last act test is satisfied because the Accused had done all the acts which he believed necessary to commit murder. On the facts, all indications suggest that the Accused would have continued to strike at the Victim if the Victim’s father had not intervened. Even taking the Victim’s injuries as they stand, Dr Thomas Loh, the specialist involved in the management of the wounds on the Victim’s head and neck, testified that without medical intervention in the form of haemostasis and ligation, the Accused would have continued to bleed and eventually go into a haemorrhagic shock which would be life-threatening.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">308 The issue of provocation brings me back to the question of whether the Accused did in fact see the Victim’s wallpaper and then lose control of his senses. As mentioned above (see [148], [157(f)] and [163(k)]), the two psychiatrists had assumed that the Accused did in fact see the Victim’s wallpaper and, so far, I have proceeded on the same assumption. However, I now examine this assumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">309 The Accused’s post-offence conduct and statements are relevant in this regard. As is evident from the above discussion, the Accused did not initially mention the Victim’s wallpaper as the reason for his attack on the Victim, or that he had lost control of his senses for any reason. Instead, he was seeking to provide what he perceived to be a rational reason for his attack which was that she had been unfaithful to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 Thus, the Accused did not mention to Hanif about the alleged wallpaper or that he did not know what was happening at the material time of the alleged offence because he had lost control or awareness of his senses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 Further, the Accused did not mention either of these reasons to SI Irwan or SSGT Khairul. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 He also did not mention either of these reasons in his 1st Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 In his 2nd Statement, the Accused did say “I then asked her why she cheated me.

</div> However, there was no mention of the alleged provocative wallpaper. The Accused had apparently gotten angry and lost control because of his argument with the Victim and not the wallpaper.

Yet, it was not suggested to the Victim, when she gave her evidence in Court, that the Accused had actually taken her handphone from her before the assault.

</div> His oral evidence was that he could not remember what happened after he saw the wallpaper. However, the recording officer was not challenged on the accuracy of the first sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">316 In my view, the Accused did provide that information to the recording officer but it was doubtful that he had actually taken the Victim’s handphone from her hand before the assault. This was an embellishment of his which cast doubt as to whether he had even seen the wallpaper in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 The 5th Statement did not mention the wallpaper but it did deny any intention to kill the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">318 Importantly, there was no suggestion from any factual witness, other than the Accused himself, that, after the assault, the Accused appeared lost or confused or that he had expressed surprise or regret on discovering what he had done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 While the courts have in some instances declined to place much weight on an accused person’s post-offence conduct, I see no reason in the circumstances to adopt such a position. Provocation is a partial statutory defence, and the burden is on the Defence to establish that the Accused did see the wallpaper at the material time and that it caused him to lose control of his senses. For the reasons mentioned, I am not persuaded that the Accused saw the wallpaper at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 In any event, the Accused demonstrated such presence of mind around the time of the alleged offence that I also do not accept that he had been subjectively deprived of self-control at the material time. As I mentioned above (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, at [205], [281] and [313]), he appears to have been sufficiently rational and composed to consider the need and means to convince external parties of the Victim’s infidelity in order to justify his own conduct. Indeed, the reference in the Accused’s own statement to the fact that he had picked up the Victim’s handphone in a bid to gather evidence of her infidelity suggests a rational process going on in his mind. This was contrary to the suggestion that the Victim’s wallpaper in her handphone had caused him to subjectively lose control of himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">321 It is therefore unnecessary to consider the objective requirement pertaining to the partial defence of provocation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two limbs of s 307 of the PC </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 Section 307(1) of the PC has two limbs (see [124] above).

The second limb provides for an aggravated form attempted murder: in addition to the elements under the first limb, it must further be shown that “hurt [was] caused to any person by such act”. If this is proved, the accused “shall be liable to either imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to caning or fine”. The salient difference between the two limbs is therefore the sentencing option that is available to the Court upon conviction of the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 In the present case, the Charge was brought under the second limb of s 307 of the PC (see [1] above).

Such practice is also popular with script writers for Indian movies. It may not be out of place to mention that watching Tamil movies is the national pass time for most of the Tamils in Tamil Nadu. For an Accused coming from such background, this ridiculous method of punishing the [Victim] is not novel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 The Defence cited <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span> to support its argument that the Court should be conscience of cultural differences in multi-cultural, multi-religious, and structured society.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326  I did not give weight to this line of argument raised by the Defence. If the Defence wanted to adduce evidence regarding the cultural backdrop and regular pastimes in the Accused’s hometown, that should be done by way of witness testimony, and not in the closing submissions. This is also not a matter for which judicial notice is warranted. In any event, as the Defence itself acknowledged, the Court of Appeal’s comment in <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>was about culture in the context of the legislative history of the PC, and not about any broad proposition that the Court is bound or entitled to accept evidence from the bar as to the kind of “cultural background and thinking” of the Accused.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 I note that Dr Rajesh had also opined that the Accused’s desire to commit suicide in front of the Victim should be understood in a cultural context. According to Dr Rajesh, the Accused was someone who hails from a rural part of India. It was the first time the Accused has gone to another country for work and a rare occasion for him to interact with the opposite sex. Thus, the dramatic behaviour of cutting himself to prove his love to her is something which can be understood from a cultural perspective, even though a “Singapore Indian” will not do that and not all “India Indians” will do that.
