</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        The accused is a 36 -year

old man charged with trafficking, by transportation, 259.96 nett grammes of diamorphine

from Yew Tee Industrial Estate to a road junction beneath the Moulmein Flyover on 9 March

2002 between 3.45 and 4.25 pm. The accused represented by Mr. Luke Lee, indicated that he

wished to plead guilty to the charge, and Mr. Lee confirmed that that was the instruction

he had received from his client. This being a capital case, I declined the plea and

directed the prosecution to satisfy me that the charge be proved. Mr. Eugene Lee and Mr.

Jared Pereira the prosecuting counsel adduced the following evidence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        Evidence from a number of

officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau "CNB") including SSG Yon Boon Ngiap,

Sgt Ho Kian Sing,W/Cpl Chan Jee Yeng, W/SSG Rahizah Rahim, Sgt Eddie Wee, Sgt Soo Sin

Ghee, SSG Kua Boon San, and Sgt Mohamed Hafiz shows that the accused was being watched by

CNB officers as early as 11 am on the day of his arrest. In the long stake-out the accused

was traced from catching a taxi near his flat at Choa Chu Kang and travelling to Bishan

Street 11 to pick up a man later ascertained to be Rozali Bin Mohamad Yassim. The duo then

went to a vehicle rental company called Cars And Carriage Rent-A-Car Pte Ltd at the Plaza

Park Royal Hotel at Beach Road. Wee Chee Seng, the manager of that rental company

testified that the accused rented a van registered as GT 6730 Z for two days from 9 March.

After taking the van the accused and Rozali drove to the Starhub Centre at Kramat Road

where they had a meal at the food court there. After that the accused went to a lottery

shop at Cuppage Plaza and Rozali met one Mohamad Yazid at a side entrance of the same

building. The trio then walked through the Centrepoint building to the carpark at Starhub

Centre where the van was parked. They drove to Jalan Jurong Kechil after stopping over at

the carpark of Block 1001 JTC Redhill Industrial Park where they had a drink at the

Farasha Restaurant. They went into a provision shop and returned to the van with Rozali

carrying a brown box.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        The trio left Jalan Jurong

Kechil and arrived at an Esso petrol station at Upper Bukit Timah Road at 3.30 pm. There

Rozali filled petrol into two bottles while the accused went to have a change of clothing

from the gray t-shirt and blue jeans to a white t-shirt and grey Bermuda shorts. From

there the gang proceeded to the Yew Tee Industrial Estate. The van drove off shortly, made

several turns and returned to the same spot, outside the Koh Seng Hong provision shop,

where, Yazid loaded a basket of cucumbers into the rear of the van. The trio drove off

again after that and stopped along Woodlands Road near the Kranji Expressway exit where

the accused was seen taking a brown box from the rear of the van to the driver's cabin.

They then drove off towards Balestier Road where the van was intercepted by CNB officers

below the Moulmein Flyover. All three men put up a violent struggle but were eventually

subdued, arrested and subsequently charged. A brown box was recovered from the front

passenger side of the van. In it were a total of six packages of granular substance later

analysed (by the Health Sciences Authority) to be 296.96 nett grammes of diamorphine.

Rozali and Yazid were given an unconditional discharge. They testified in court giving an

account of their journey with the accused on the day in question although they made no

mention of their role in respect, or knowledge of, the drugs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The prosecution also

produced in evidence, without challenge, three statements made by the accused in which he

admitted knowledge that he was carrying heroin in his van and that he was the one who took

them from the rear of the van and placed them at the front. He also admitted taking out a

knife and placing it on top of the brown box containing the drugs. At the close of the

prosecution case I called upon the accused to enter his defence, but he elected to remain

silent and offered no other evidence. I reviewed the evidence above and am satisfied that

the prosecution had made out its case beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the

accused as charged and sentenced him to suffer death.</p>
