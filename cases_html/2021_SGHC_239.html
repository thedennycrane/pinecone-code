According to the defendant, the GS Engineering Letter was also issued under suspicious circumstances. Although the GS Engineering Letter was issued pursuant to a secret meeting with the plaintiff on 14 July 2021, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one day before the AD was rendered, it took GS Engineering more than three weeks to write the GS Engineering Letter, which was dated 10 August 2021. By then, the plaintiff was given notice that the defendant was granted leave on 4 August 2021 to enforce the AD and that the defendant was indeed seeking to do so on 5 August 2021. In any case, the rate of $10/m3 for a cement dosage of ≤60kg/m3 in the GS Engineering Letter is irrelevant to the Subcontract rates entered between the plaintiff and the defendant, because the Subcontract rates are not pegged to those in the main contract.

A fraudulent party cannot be allowed to claim that he could have been caught had reasonable diligence been exercised, but because he was not caught, he should be allowed to get away with it. Such a view would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and it would be unprincipled to hold in effect that there is no sanction on the fraudulent party because he could have been found out earlier.

In other words, the facts must have been an <span class="font-italic">operative cause</span> in the issuance of the AD. It matters not what the claimant did or did not think was material at the relevant time. What matters is that the court is satisfied that the false facts were <span class="font-italic">material</span> to the making of the original order based on the reasoning and arguments at the time the order in question was made. The objective of the Act is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry, by among other methods, creating an intervening process of adjudication, which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined (see s 21 of the [SOPA]; [<span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380] at [18]–[20] and <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> [<span class="font-italic">Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 797] at [48]). The requirement of materiality provides the right balance in promoting the objective of achieving temporal finality in ADs by prescribing the circumstances under which they may be set aside on the ground of fraud. This would ensure that ADs will not be set aside based on mere allegations of fraud.

In the premises, I agreed with [the plaintiff] that Article 11.9 of the [Subcontract] sets out the procedure to be followed in such a situation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">“11.9 In case new items which are not listed, or listed but have no defined unit rate in the Bill of Quantities occur during the performance of the Subcontract Works, the unit rate for these items shall be calculated at i) similar Unit Prices and Rates in the Bill of Quantities, ii) if there are no similar Unit Prices and Rates to be applicable, then at the reasonable then-current market rate to be agreed by the Parties, or iii) in the event of disagreement, at such rate as the Contractor shall determine as appropriate, in his opinion, which shall be used to settle both Interim Final Account and Final Account hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall be applied to the determination for the new items for Change In Works.”</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">163 On this basis, [the defendant] submitted that the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works should be S$18.90/m3, as light grouting works and trench grouting works are largely similar with the only difference being “<span class="font-italic">the eventual purpose for which the treated soil is used – trench grouting is used to create a trench for a retaining wall and light grouting is used to create a stable platform at the ground level for subsequent works</span>” (see paragraph 37(b) of [the defendant]’s Reply Submissions). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">As [</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the plaintiff] had agreed to the rate of S$18.90/m3 for the trench grouting works, that should likewise be the applicable rate for the light grouting works.</span> [The defendant] had also prepared a table at paragraph 37(f) of [the defendant]’s Reply Submissions illustrating the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">similarities between the trench grouting works and the light grouting works</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">164 As stated at [151] above, it is salient to mention that [the plaintiff] neither disputed the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works nor did it provide an alternative rate for assessing the additional light grouting works in PR 12. Nonetheless, it orally submitted at the 2nd Adjudication Conference that the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works should be “<span class="font-italic">pro-rated or benchmarked against the rate used for “DSM Grouting” works</span>” (see paragraph 56 of the AR Submissions). It further orally submitted at the 2nd Adjudication Conference that light grouting works are different from both DSM and trench grouting works in terms of grouting capacity (or cement dosage) and sought on this basis, to derive an applicable rate for the light grouting works by comparing the grouting capacity and/or efficiency of the light grouting works with that of the DSM Grouting works (see paragraphs 58-62 of the AR Submissions).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">165 In my view, while there appeared to be some <span class="font-italic">possible</span> correlation between the cement dosage and/or grouting capacity of the various types of grouting works as well as applicable rate, it is unclear to me if such a simplistic calculation of the applicable rate for the light grouting works should be adopted, in particular, because the cement dosage (and/or grouting capacity) and the applicable rate may not be linearly correlated. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Instead, I am satisfied that there is sufficient similarity between the trench grouting works and the light grouting works for them to be assessed at the same rate, in accordance with limb (i) of Article 11.9 of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[Subcontract].</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">166 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In the premises</span>, I accept [the defendant]’s submissions that the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works is S$18.90/m3. In this regard, I am <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">also guided</span> by the fact that the rate of S$18.90/m3 appears fairly consistent with the two (2) alternative quotations that [the defendant] had procured (of S$21.50/m3 and S$23.50/m3), as the market rate for the light grouting works. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 From the above, it is clear that the adjudicator did not rely primarily on the Two Quotations as being reflective of the market rate in coming to his decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The adjudicator’s preceding analysis shows that he was relying on the defendant’s submission. As can be seen above, the defendant’s submission in AA 108 was that the applicable rate for the Additional Light Grouting Works should be S$18.90/m3, as light grouting works and trench grouting works are largely similar. In contrast, the plaintiff submitted to the adjudicator that (a) the applicable rate for the Additional Light Grouting Works should be pro-rated or benchmarked against the rate used for DSM Grouting works, and (b) sought to derive an applicable rate for the light grouting works by comparing the grouting capacity and/or efficiency of the light grouting works with that of the DSM Grouting works. The adjudicator stated in clear terms that he rejected the plaintiff’s submission because it was simplistic: cement dosage and the applicable rate may not be linearly correlated. The adjudicator then stated that he was “[i]nstead” satisfied that there was sufficient similarity between the trench grouting works and the light grouting works for them to share the same rate pursuant to Art 11.9 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In coming to his holding, the adjudicator stated that “[i]n the premises” he accepted the defendant’s submissions that the applicable rate for the Additional Light Grouting Works is $18.90/m3. This phrasing unequivocally connotes that he was relying on his preceding analysis where he accepted that there was sufficient similarity between the trench grouting works and the light grouting works. Accordingly, his observation with regard to the Two Quotations as being indicative of the market rate appears to be merely confirmatory in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The second element</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Next, I shall examine if the plaintiff has proven the second element of Step 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> test. The issue here is whether the Two Quotations gave a false indication of the market rate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff submits that the profiles of Ground Mix and Segang show that they do not have the proper standing to quote rates for light grouting works that were reflective of the market rate. Ground Mix and Segang are small companies with little paid-up capital: $450,000 and $100,000 respectively. It is therefore doubtful as to whether such companies could carry out high capital expenditure works such as DSM main grouting works. Moreover, based on searches done on their profiles on the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) online Directory, they do not appear to be licensed or registered with BCA to carry out DSM works. Segang’s profile on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Business Profile also shows that its principal activities are foundation works and the renting of industrial machinery and equipment, so it is unclear if Segang actually carries out light grouting works. As for Ground Mix, its registered office is a virtual office address that is shared by several other companies, which casts doubt on whether it is an operational business.

There is no evidence to suggest that these two contractors have deliberately come up with an inflated figure to support the defendant. Ground Mix and Segang may be small companies, but it does not necessarily follow that they cannot provide quotations that accord with the market rate. The plaintiff also did not adduce expert evidence to show what the market rate for light grouting works should have been.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Next, I place little weight on the rate of $10/m3 agreed with GS Engineering. Given that GS Engineering is the main contractor for the Project, I agree with the defendant’s submission that it has a vested interest in agreeing on a lower rate. If the plaintiff pays the defendant a lower rate, it is plausible that GS Engineering would accordingly owe the plaintiff lesser monies for work done for the Project. It is also suspicious that the plaintiff and GS Engineering would come to such an agreement on 14 July 2021, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one day before the AD was issued.

Here, the Project involved additional underground light grouting and trench grouting works to a depth of 17.9m from the surface. In the case of the Sambo Quotation, that project only involved surface light grouting works to a depth of 5m. Moreover, the present Project needed additional light grouting works, which rates were not fixed by the contract. For the Sambo Quotation, it concerned original works which rates were fixed by contract. It accords with common sense that the rates for additional works not covered by the original contract will inevitably be higher than any original works due to the urgent and unforeseen nature of additional work.

Even if it did, the Sambo Quotation would just show one instance of a lower rate ($5/m3) than the Two Quotations ($21.50/m3 and $23.50/m3). That is plainly insufficient to show that the Two Quotations were not reflective of the market rate. Rather, it simply indicates that the parties to the Sambo Project had managed to negotiate for a lower rate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Indeed, the defendant had quoted a much higher rate of $35/m3 for light grouting works in another tender for Tuksu E&amp;C Pte Ltd (the “Tuksu Tender”).

</div> However, the plaintiff submits that the rate quoted in the Tuksu Tender cannot be relied upon. According to the plaintiff, the project for the Tuksu Tender (the “Tuksu Project”) has main grouting rates that are more than two times that of the present Project, which shows that the ground improvement works required for these two projects are dissimilar. In contrast, the works for the Project and the Sambo Project are comparable because the DSM main grouting rates are similar.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Again, the plaintiff’s submission is unmeritorious. Even if it is the case that the works for the Project and the Sambo Project are similar but the applicable rates for light grouting works are dissimilar, that does <span class="font-italic">not</span> imply that there is fraud in the present case. Construction agreements are bespoke transactions. The agreed rate for light grouting works in every tender depends not only on <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">nature of the works</span> needed for the project at hand, but also <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">parties’ bargaining power</span> in the transaction. The rates from the Two Quotations, the Sambo Quotation, the agreement with GS Engineering and the Tuksu Tender range from as low as $5/m3 to as high as $35/m3. This shows that the rate for light grouting works can vary significantly depending on the project at hand. The difference in rates does not by itself evidence any impropriety in any of the transactions. Moreover, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution </span>at [35], “[t]here must be compelling evidence of fraud before the court”. It must <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>follow that the court cannot impute fraud solely based on a difference in rates across tenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Overall, the plaintiff’s evidence in support of its claim is speculative at best. I reiterate that proof of fraud demands a high threshold to be met. On the facts, I find that the plaintiff is unable to prove that the Two Quotations were inauthentic and false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Moreover, for the reasons below, it is apparent that the plaintiff’s submission was a mere afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, pursuant to s 15(3) of the SOPA, the allegation that the Two Quotations were not genuine should have been raised in the plaintiff’s payment response, if this was indeed true. This was not done. Furthermore, as noted by the adjudicator at [164] of the AD, the plaintiff did not proffer other alternative rates during the adjudication proceedings. The plaintiff could have also written to Ground Mix and Segang much earlier if it had suspected that the Two Quotations had departed egregiously from what it perceived to be the market rate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Second, it is obvious that the quotations of the Sambo Project and GS Engineering are important to the plaintiff. The plaintiff could have sought the quotations from GS Engineering and the Sambo Project earlier for these quotations to be included in its payment response. If it had done so, these quotations, which were crucial to the plaintiff’s case in AA 108, could have been considered by the adjudicator. Yet, glaringly, this was not done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I note that on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>evidence of fraud could be adduced at any time. However, <span class="font-italic">Facade </span><span class="font-italic">Solution </span>does not preclude the court from making appropriate inferences from the plaintiff’s conduct. To begin with, I have found that the evidence that the plaintiff relies on to support the purported fraud is speculative at best (see [59] above). Next, as elucidated above at [61]–[62], this evidence should have been adduced in the payment response for the adjudicator’s consideration. Considering the plaintiff’s conduct in totality, it suggests that the plaintiff is mounting a last-ditch attempt at setting aside the AD on the purported allegation of fraud. It is clear that the plaintiff failed to adduce its tenuous evidence during the adjudication proceedings and now attempts to adduce them in order to set aside the AD, couching them as indicative of fraud. The plaintiff’s present application to set aside the AD on the ground of fraud is simply a mere afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The third element</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I turn now to the third element of Step 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> test. The plaintiff has to prove that the defendant knew or ought to reasonably have known the facts in question to be false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The plaintiff relies heavily on the Sambo Quotation in its submission for this issue. As regards the Sambo Quotation, the defendant tendered the rate of $5/m3 for the Sambo Project on 12 April 2021. This was about the same time the defendant served Payment Claim 12 on the plaintiff on 20 April 2021 wherein the defendant claimed the rate of $18.90/m3. Hence, the plaintiff submits that it is inconceivable that the defendant genuinely believed that the Two Quotations of $21.50/m3 and $23.50/m3 were reflective of the market rate.

Moreover, as I have also noted above, the defendant had quoted a much higher rate of $35/m3 for the Tuksu Tender.

</div> I reiterate that the plaintiff’s lack of objection was recognised by the adjudicator in the AD (at [164]), which is reproduced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As stated at [151] above, it is salient to mention that [the plaintiff] neither disputed the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works nor did it provide an alternative rate for assessing the additional light grouting works in PR 12<span class="font-italic">.</span> Nonetheless, it orally submitted at the 2nd Adjudication Conference that the applicable rate for the additional light grouting works should be “<span class="font-italic">pro-rated or benchmarked against the rate used for “DSM Grouting” works</span>” (see paragraph 56 of the AR Submissions). It further orally submitted at the 2nd Adjudication Conference that light grouting works are different from both DSM and trench grouting works in terms of grouting capacity (or cement dosage) and sought on this basis, to derive an applicable rate for the light grouting works by comparing the grouting capacity and/or efficiency of the light grouting works with that of the DSM Grouting works (See paragraphs 58-62 of the AR Submissions).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen from the above, the nature of the plaintiff’s objection was that it proffered a better way to calculate the applicable rate for the Additional Light Grouting Works. The plaintiff did not submit that the Two Quotations had deviated acutely from the market rate and thus should not be used, despite having full knowledge that the Two Quotations were in the defendant’s submission. The plaintiff must, therefore, have acquiesced to this submission by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the Two Quotations did reflect the market rate. Furthermore, the ACRA searches which the plaintiff had recently done to impugn Ground Mix’s and Segang’s business standing – and therefore the authenticity of the Two Quotations – could have easily been done for the purpose of the adjudication proceedings. But this was not done.  Hence, I find that the plaintiff accepted and, therefore, knew that the Two Quotations were genuine during the adjudication proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Having implicitly conceded that the Two Quotations did reflect the market rate, the plaintiff’s subsequent attempts at contacting Ground Mix and Segang and impugning their business standing are nothing other than a last-ditch attempt at finding a ground to set aside the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff additionally submits that the defendant had attempted to conceal the documents relating to the Sambo Quotation.

To recapitulate, this was because the adjudicator had decided that since the Additional Light Grouting Works were similar to the additional trench grouting works, their applicable rates should be the same. This was the ground that was relied on by the adjudicator in deciding this issue. It must follow that even if the adjudicator had known that the Two Quotations were not reflective of the market rate for light grouting works, the outcome of the AD would have been the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Therefore, I find that Step 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> test is not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on setting aside the AD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> test is satisfied on the present facts.

In the course of arguments, the Respondent sought to argue that these situations were two limbs of a test that are “not entirely disjunctive” – in that the first limb of the test was a “useful <span class="font-italic">indicator</span>” of whether the second has been fulfilled. I am unable to agree with this interpretation. I accept that the inquiry under the second situation is broader in nature and will necessarily encompass instances where the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency is established. However, where a party seeking a stay of enforcement is able to produce clear, objective evidence of the other party’s <span class="font-italic">actual present</span> insolvency, that suffices to give pause to the enforcement process of the adjudication determination. There is no need to produce further evidence of the possibility of non-recovery, as the term “useful indicator” would suggest. Conversely, even where actual present insolvency is not established, it should remain open to a party seeking a stay to produce some other evidence to convince the court of its case in accordance with the second situation above. To hold otherwise would unduly tip the balance in favour of a successful claimant far beyond what was envisioned by the Court of Appeal in [<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The court in <span class="font-italic">CEQ</span> further elucidated (at [11]) that the second limb of the <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> test does not require “a closed category of specific <span class="font-italic">financial</span> events to occur or be present before the court grants the relief of a stay” [emphasis in original]. Rather, the second limb “ought to be more properly recognised as a guiding principle that is to be applied in every case that comes before the court: the court must countenance and ameliorate <span class="font-italic">any</span> potential for impossibility of recovery by a successful appellant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a respondent who loses at first instance but succeeds on appeal” [emphasis in original]. Hence, instances where a stay should be granted under the second limb include: (a) circumstances indicating “a real risk of dissipation of the disputed funds awarded to the [successful claimant]”; and (b) situations where there is “any <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence or suspicion that the claimant had been using its claim as an abuse of process”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The court in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> added that the two limbs are not the only considerations before the court in deciding whether to grant a stay (at [70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further, … a court may properly consider whether the claimant’s financial distress was, to a significant degree, caused by the respondent’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount and, also, whether the claimant was already in a similar state of financial strength or weakness (as the case may be) at the time the parties entered into their contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Should a stay of enforcement be granted?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 To begin with, the defendant has declined to furnish (a) its bank account statements for the last six months showing its cash balance; (b) any relevant transactions showing that it has ongoing work and receivables; (c) project documents for any ongoing projects including contracts, correspondence, and progress claims and certifications; (d) annual returns and financial statements for the financial year ending 30 June 2020; and (e) financial statements for the financial year ending 30 June 2019.

Where a release of the undisputed sum (S/N 2 of Table 1) to the defendant is granted, the remainder of the Adjudicated Sum (S/N 3 of Table 1) will <span class="font-italic">continue to be held by the court</span> till ARB 210 is concluded. Hence, the plaintiff’s concerns regarding the defendant’s inability to pay the possible sums due to it falls away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Hence, I am satisfied that a partial release of the Adjudicated Sum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the release of the undisputed sum of $1,205,565.01, to the defendant should be ordered as the plaintiff does not deny that it owes the defendant this sum. Accordingly, I grant a partial stay of enforcement of the AD.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Injunction against winding up application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I turn now to the last issue regarding the injunction to restrain the defendant from commencing a winding up application against the plaintiff pending the disposal of the proceedings in ARB 210.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It is unnecessary to examine whether the defendant has a legal basis to commence such an application against the plaintiff. Since the plaintiff has already paid the Adjudicated Sum into court, there is simply no reason for the defendant to commence a winding up application against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Furthermore, since I have granted a partial stay of enforcement of the AD and the Order, it would be inimical to the defendant’s interests to commence a winding up application against the plaintiff. After all, the defendant would need the plaintiff to participate in ARB 210 for a final determination as to whether the defendant is entitled to any part of the Adjudicated Sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Hence, I do not make any order for the injunction sought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For the above reasons, I allow the plaintiff’s claim in part. I summarise my findings and orders as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As I have found that the plaintiff has not proven that the AD should be set aside on the ground of fraud pursuant to s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SOPA, I do not set aside the AD and the Order for its enforcement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I order a partial stay of enforcement of the AD pending the disposal of the proceedings in ARB 210,<span class="font-italic"> ie</span>, the release of the undisputed sum of $1,205,565.01 to the defendant. If the partial stay is not granted, the Adjudicated Sum paid to the defendant may not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties is finally resolved in the plaintiff’s favour. However, if the plaintiff succeeds in ARB 210, it can recover the sums due from the remainder of the Adjudicated Sum, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, $1,223,125.03, which continues to be held by the court. Hence, I order that the plaintiff pays the defendant the undisputed sum of $1,205,565.01 from the amount paid into court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Since there is no reason for the defendant to commence a winding up application against the plaintiff as the undisputed sum will be released from the Adjudicated Sum the plaintiff has paid into court, I make no order for an injunction against the defendant to prevent it from doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I shall hear parties on the issue of costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Campos Conrad Melville, Chong Jia Hao and Michelle Lim Ann Nee (RHTLaw Asia LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">S.
