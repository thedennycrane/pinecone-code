The parties had entered into the Settlement Agreement in resolution of their differences arising out of Civil Appeals Nos 101, 102 and 103 of 2015 (“the Winding Up Appeals”), which were appeals brought by LSE against the decision of the High Court to: (a) grant LCM’s applications in Companies Winding Up Nos 226, 227 and 228 of 2014 (“the Winding Up Applications”) for the TL Companies to be wound up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed); and (b) order LSE to pay LCM costs fixed at S$40,000 excluding disbursements, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of LSE’s shares in the TL Companies (“the Costs Order”): see <span class="font-italic">Lin Choo Mee v Tat Leong Development (Pte) Ltd and others and other matters </span>[2015] SGHC 99 (“the Winding Up Judgment”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, LCM was entitled to receive a sum of money in lieu of his shares in the TL Companies (“the Consideration”), and this sum could only be determined once the sale price of a shop unit at 14 Scotts Road #03-11, Far East Plaza (“the FEP Unit”) had been determined. LCM also alleged that LSE was obliged under the same agreement to satisfy the Costs Order. To date, the FEP Unit remains unsold, the Consideration remains unpaid, and the Costs Order remains unsatisfied. LCM thus commenced the Suit, alleging, among other things, that LSE had breached various terms under the Settlement Agreement by failing to both sell the FEP Unit and pay LCM the Consideration within the stipulated timeframes, and failing to satisfy the Costs Order. The Judge found in favour of LCM on these issues. LSE now brings the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We reserved judgment following the hearing, and now furnish our decision and the accompanying reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 LSE and LCM are respectively the eldest and second eldest sons of Mr Lin Whan Chiu (“the Father”), who, with his wife, Mdm Tan Ah Kar (“the Mother”), had a total of five sons and three daughters (collectively, “the Lin Family”). The Lin Family operated a business that was primarily focused on the petroleum industry, and which gradually diversified into properties. LSE was the driving force behind the Lin Family business.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The TL Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In June 1977, LSE and his wife, Mdm Tan Lay Hoon (“TLH”), incorporated TL Petroleum. LCM was appointed a director of TL Petroleum shortly thereafter. In January 1979, LSE and LCM incorporated TL Development, and were its founding directors and shareholders. In May 1983, LSE and LCM incorporated TL Investment, and were also its founding directors and shareholders. TL Investment is an investment holding company with the chief purpose of holding shares in TL Development – indeed, presently, the only assets that TL Investment holds are shares in TL Development. Leadership of the TL Companies was vested in the Father and three of his eldest sons, while ownership of the TL Companies resided primarily in the Father and all five of his sons. LSE was, at all times, either the joint or outright majority shareholder in TL Development and TL Investment. Following the transfer of the Father’s shares in TL Development and TL Petroleum to LSE in 1991 (after the Father was diagnosed with cancer), LSE became the clear majority shareholder in the TL Companies, while LCM was a minority shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The TL Companies made several significant property investments over the years. In 1986, the Father and the Mother sold a portion of a piece of property that they owned at 5 Teo Kim Eng Road to TL Development, and TL Development proceeded to redevelop the property into two semi-detached houses (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau). Whereas the Father’s third son had occupied 25 Jalan Rimau from 1990 to 2000 and the youngest son has been residing there since 2000, LCM and his family moved into 27 Jalan Rimau in 1991 and resided there until 30 March 2016, when they moved out as required under cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement (see [20] and [27] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In 1990, TL Development purchased four shophouses. TL Development sold the first in 1994 and the remaining shophouses in 2000, and part of the sales proceeds was invested in two Chinese companies: Fujian Putian Minxin Building Coating Materials Co Ltd and Fujian Putian Yongda Construction Materials Co Ltd (also referred to by the parties as Yongda Building Material Co Ltd (“Yongda”)) (collectively, “the Chinese Subsidiaries”). TL Development is the sole shareholder in both of the Chinese Subsidiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sometime after 1991, TL Petroleum purchased the FEP Unit, which initially functioned as the headquarters of the TL Companies, but has been rented out since 2007.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In 2000, the Father’s third eldest son resigned as a director of TL Development and sold his shares in the TL Companies to LSE. In 2002, the Father’s fourth eldest son sold his shares in TL Development and TL Investment to both LCM and the Father’s youngest son, and sold his shares in TL Petroleum to LSE. On 7 March 2013, at the annual general meetings of both TL Development and TL Investment, LCM’s term as director in both companies was not renewed, and LSE’s wife (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, TLH) was appointed as director in LCM’s place in both companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Winding Up Applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 13 November 2014, LCM commenced the Winding Up Applications, seeking to wind up the TL Companies under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act on the basis that it was just and equitable to do so. LCM submitted that: (a) whereas there had been a mutual understanding that all the sons in the Lin Family would participate in the running of the TL Companies, LCM had been deliberately excluded from the management of the TL Companies; (b) the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LCM and LSE had broken down, such that they were no longer able to work in concert in the management and conduct of the business of the TL Companies; and (c) the substrata of the TL Companies had ceased to exist, and were operating at a loss despite their significant assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 13 April 2015, Steven Chong J (as he then was) issued the Winding Up Judgment, in which he found that: (a) the TL Companies were “family companies”, in the sense that a relationship of mutual trust and confidence was central to the existence of those companies such that they were quasi-partnerships, and it was clear that this relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LSE and LCM had disintegrated (see the Winding Up Judgment at [74]–[79]); and (b) LCM had been deliberately excluded from the management of TL Development and TL Investment, in breach of an understanding that LCM was to have a management role in the TL Companies (at [80]–[81]). Accordingly, Chong J found that there was unfairness that warranted a court-ordered winding up of the TL Companies under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act, and granted the Winding Up Applications (at [82]–[89]). However, Chong J ordered, pursuant to s 257(1) of the Companies Act, the winding up order to be stayed for 30 days to allow the parties to reach an amicable settlement (at [98]). Finally, Chong J ordered LSE to pay LCM costs fixed at S$40,000 excluding disbursements, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of LSE’s shares in the TL Companies (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Costs Order) (at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The parties failed to resolve their differences within 30 days. LSE thus filed the Winding Up Appeals on 23 May 2015. On 5 June 2015, LSE applied for a stay of the orders made in the Winding Up Applications. On 23 June 2015, a stay of Chong J’s orders was granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 23 November 2015, at the hearing of the Winding Up Appeals, the Court of Appeal suggested that parties attend mediation to resolve their differences. On 28 December 2015, the parties attended mediation and, at the conclusion of the session, entered into the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The arrangement that the parties consented to under the Settlement Agreement was for: (a) LCM’s shareholding in the TL Companies to be disposed of either by LSE purchasing LCM’s shareholding in those companies or by capital reduction of those companies, with the net effect being that LCM would receive the Consideration in lieu of his shares in the TL Companies; and (b) each party to bear his own costs of the Winding Up Appeals (see cll 1 and 2 of the Settlement Agreement).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Consideration was to be computed in accordance with cll 3 to 8 of the Settlement Agreement, which provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. The consideration for [LCM’s] shareholding in the [TL Companies, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Consideration] shall be the aggregate of the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) in relation to the shareholding in [TL Development] and [TL Investment] the consideration shall be 23.44% of the net tangible asset value of [TL Development]; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) in relation to the shareholding in [TL Petroleum], 14.81% of the net tangible asset value of [TL Petroleum].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. The net tangible asset value of [TL Development] shall be [-$200,431 - $1,088,537 + the Value of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau - $1,051,501 + the Value of the Chinese Subsidiaries + $50,674].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. The net tangible asset value of [TL Petroleum] shall be [$279,990 - $511,320 + <span class="font-italic">the Sale Price of [the </span><span class="font-italic">FEP Unit]</span>].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. The Value of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau shall be the open market value with vacant possession fixed by M/s Colliers International Singapore, who shall be appointed by [TL Development], on their usual terms.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. The Value of the Chinese Subsidiaries shall be [RMB1,430,422 + RMB9,752, 192 – RMB 6,504,057 - RMB8,226,423 - RMB2,000,000 + Value of the Building owned by [Yongda]] converted into S$ at the rate of S$1.00 to RMB 4.6098.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. The Value of the Building owned by [Yongda] shall be the open market value with vacant possession fixed by M/s Colliers International Singapore, who shall be appointed by [TL Development], on their usual terms.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In other words, cl 3 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the Consideration comprises two main figures: first, 23.44% of the net tangible asset value (“NTAV”) of TL Development; and second, 14.81% of the NTAV of TL Petroleum. In relation to the NTAV of TL Development, it shall be computed in accordance with cl 4, and two of the individual components stated in cl 4 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the value of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau, and the value of the Chinese Subsidiaries) shall be computed in accordance with cll 6–8.

On 8 July 2016, LSE replied, stating that he did not agree with LCM’s proposals.

In the result, in so far as we uphold the Judge’s finding that LSE had breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term and cl 13, we <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">dismiss </span>the appeal.

It is an established principle of contract law that a term cannot be implied where it would contradict the express terms of the contract (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 06.054). In this respect, a perusal of the text of the <span class="font-italic">express</span> terms, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, cll 10(b) and 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement, as well as the general context of these clauses suggests that the obligations imposed therein are <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> in nature. This is because they support the inference that the parties had sought <span class="font-italic">closure</span> in relation to their various disagreements, and this was to be achieved by disengaging from their relationships in the TL Companies promptly within the periods of time stipulated in cll 10(b) and 10(c). However, it was argued before us and below that a term ought to be <span class="font-italic">implied</span> to the effect that the sale price of the FEP Unit ought to be a reasonable one (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Reasonable Price Term) (see [23(b)] above). That particular term, by its very nature, would undermine the <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> obligation pursuant to cll 10(b) and 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement, given that if a seller were subject to both an obligation to sell a property by a fixed date <span class="font-italic">and</span> an obligation to sell it at a reasonable price, he would necessarily be in breach of either of these obligations if the stipulated date has arrived but the price offered for the property remains unreasonable. Hence, the Reasonable Price Term would ordinarily <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been implied given the established principle referred to earlier. This is in contrast to the Reasonable Endeavours Term, which is not only consistent with but also complements cll 10(b) and 10(c) (see [23(a)] above). The specific difficulty that arises in respect of the present appeal, however, is that it is <span class="font-italic">common ground</span> between the parties that the Reasonable Price Term <span class="font-italic">is</span> an implied term of the Settlement Agreement. Put simply, the parties have themselves introduced an implied<span class="font-italic"> </span>term that <span class="font-italic">undermines</span> the otherwise absolute nature of cll 10(b) and 10(c). This engenders an unusual (and even ironic) situation, to say the least, since such an implied term is <span class="font-italic">created by </span><span class="font-italic">the agreement of the parties themselves</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Counsel for LCM, Mr N Sreenivasan SC (“Mr Sreenivasan”), very properly and candidly said he had not seen this conflicting argument before it was pointed out during the course of oral submissions before this court. Mr Sreenivasan then helpfully brought us through the relevant pleadings which might have conduced to this state of affairs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Mr Sreenivasan first referred us to para 15A of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) dated 28 March 2017 from LCM, which reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">15A. It is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">an implied term</span><span class="font-underline"> of the Settlement Agreement that parties shall </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">take reasonable </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">endeavours and/or do all that may be necessary</span><span class="font-underline"> to give effect to the spirit and intent of the Settlement Agreement and to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[LCM] will rely on the Settlement Agreement for its full terms and effect at the trial of the Suit herein, or any earlier hearing to determine any or all of the issues between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[underlining in original;

On the one hand, it could be argued that even the parties themselves cannot alter the legal position, which is that cll 10(b) and 10(c) are <span class="font-italic">express </span>contractual terms that impose absolute obligations on the parties, and the parties cannot be permitted to introduce an <span class="font-italic">implied</span> term (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Reasonable Price Term) that <span class="font-italic">contradicts</span> the absolute obligations imposed under cll 10(b) and 10(c).

With respect, however, we are of the view that cll 10(b) and 10(c) do <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> in fact impose <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> obligations on the parties. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In our judgment, it is necessary to give effect to the parties’ intentions in relation to their agreement to plead the Reasonable Price Term.

In gist, the purpose of interpretation is to give effect to the objectively ascertained expressed intentions of the contracting parties as it emerges from the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language.

This point is perceptively put by Prof Goh Yihan in his very recently published seminal treatise on contractual interpretation in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">Interpretation of Contracts in Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2018), in the following manner (at paras 2.042 and 2.043):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.042 More broadly, <span class="font-italic">the Court of Appeal has also emphasised the interaction between both text and context in every </span><span class="font-italic">case, even as the text ought always to be the first port of call for the court</span>. Thus, <span class="font-italic">what might at first glance appear to be plain and unambiguous text may not in fact be so, once the court has examined the relevant context.</span> Indeed, where the text is ambiguous, the relevant context will become very important in ascertaining the parties’ objective intention.

However, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. </span>…, this <span class="font-italic">does not mean that, where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply those words without utilising the relevant context to assist in the process of contractual interpretation.

Hence, there was in fact no contradiction or variation of any absolute obligation to sell the FEP Unit and pay the Consideration by the stipulated dates by the implication of the Reasonable Price Term because, in context and in truth, the timeline apparently stipulated by the express terms was subject to an unexpressed bottom line which was objectively in the mind of the parties at that time, and which subsequently found expression, independently and sequentially, in adversarial pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Of course, what that bottom-line price was or what would be considered an unreasonable price would depend very much on the particular facts and circumstances of this case, and should also be considered in the light of the fact that the agreement is one entered into as a result of a successful mediation. What was an unreasonable price would also be very closely intertwined with the Reasonable Endeavours Term, an issue which we address later (at [70]–[80] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 During the hearing, in the light of this court’s queries on the apparent absolute obligation in cll 10(b) and 10(c), Mr Sreenivasan submitted that LCM <span class="font-italic">accepted</span> the implied terms introduced by LSE at para 4A of the Defence (Amendment No 1) (see [57] above), which added to the implied term first pleaded by LCM in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (see [56] above), but with a key modification. In particular, he submitted that LCM had accepted <span class="font-italic">only</span> paras 4A(a) and 4A(c), and <span class="font-italic">not</span> para 4A(b), of the Defence (Amendment No 1). That this is in fact the case is clearly spelt out in para 5A of the Reply (Amendment No 1) (see [58] above). Mr Sreenivasan therefore maintained that LCM’s case was <span class="font-italic">still</span> premised on the argument that cll 10(b) and 10(c) were <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> (presumably because LSE had <span class="font-italic">not</span> accepted para 4A(b) of the Defence (Amendment No 1)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 With respect, we find this particular argument difficult to follow. If, indeed, cll 10(b) and 10(c) were absolute, then it would have been wholly unnecessary (or, indeed, even contrary) to LCM’s case for him to have accepted the existence of the Reasonable Price Term (which has been asserted to be an implied term). As a matter of logic (if not law), any qualification (here, by way of an implied term) would have rendered cll 10(b) and 10(c) less than absolute. Indeed, LCM’s case reflects precisely this last-mentioned point in the following two ways. First, LCM’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) reflects, in the first place, <span class="font-italic">only</span> an implied obligation on the part of the parties to take reasonable endeavours to give effect to as well as implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement (including cll 10(b) and 10(c)) in accordance with the spirit and intent of that agreement itself<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [56] above) (which is embodied in the Reasonable Endeavours Term). No mention was originally made of anything remotely related to the Reasonable Price Term. Second, and more generally, a perusal of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) as a whole reveals that LCM’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>original claim was based, in substance, on a failure by LSE to take reasonable endeavours to ensure that the obligations contained in cll 10(b) and 10(c) were fulfilled. Put simply, LCM’s case was – in substance, if not also form – <span class="font-italic">never</span> based on the alleged breach of absolute obligations to sell the FEP Unit and pay LCM the Consideration by the stipulated deadlines as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In fairness to Mr Sreenivasan, as we have noted earlier (at [55] above), when faced with the points set out above during oral submissions, he did candidly concede (correctly, in our view) that LCM’s original claim was indeed based on an alleged failure on the part of LSE to take reasonable endeavours to ensure that the obligations in the Settlement Agreement in general and in cll 10(b) and 10(c) in particular were fulfilled. The complications detailed above arose only as a result of the introduction by LSE of the additional implied terms stipulated in para 4A of the Defence (Amendment No 1). On this note, we pause to remind parties to bear in mind the basic legal principles relating to implied terms when setting forth their respective cases in respect of implied terms. The present case serves as a useful cautionary tale that there can be unnecessary complications when implied terms are averred in the course of pleadings. Returning to the present case, we are therefore satisfied that, based on the parties’ pleadings, the parties did <span class="font-italic">not</span> intend cll 10(a) and 10(b) to impose <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> obligations at the time they entered into the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Finally, we pause to note that it might, strictly speaking, be argued that the pleadings which we have taken into account above in aiding the court in ascertaining the context in which the Settlement Agreement was entered into were drafted <span class="font-italic">subsequent to</span> the time that the particular contract was entered into. However, a moment’s reflection will reveal that we are dealing here with a <span class="font-italic">highly unusual</span> fact situation. In particular, we are dealing with an agreed set of pleadings between parties who are in an adversarial position. There is also no issue relating to the objective reliability of the material that establishes the truth of the averments in the pleadings. This is quite unlike the usual case where it is one party that seeks to adduce evidence (whether written and/or oral) after the contract concerned had been entered into. In such a situation, it would undoubtedly be the case that that evidence would (unlike the situation in the present case) be <span class="font-italic">controverted</span> by the other party whilst simultaneously being subject to all the dangers from subjectivity, uncertainty and consequent unreliability that constitute the principal reasons why such evidence is generally <span class="font-italic">not</span> accepted by the Singapore courts. Looked at in this light, the present case must be viewed against its highly unusual backdrop and can therefore set no general precedent in so far as future cases are concerned. Indeed, even if the stringent criteria set out by this Court in both <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (at [132]) regarding the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of interpretation,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span><span class="font-italic">Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 regarding the requirements of civil procedure that must be met before extrinsic evidence may be relied on for the purpose of interpretation (at [65] and [72]–[74]) were taken into account, we are of the view that, given the unusual facts of the present case, the evidence substantiating the relevant pleadings would in fact pass legal muster.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For these reasons, we find in favour of LSE in so far as the Absolute Obligation Issue is concerned. However, the resolution of the Absolute Obligation Issue does not conclude the present appeal in favour of LSE because he has <span class="font-italic">also</span> to demonstrate that he had <span class="font-italic">not </span>breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term. It is therefore to this issue that we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Reasonable Endeavours Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Judge found that LSE had, in any event, breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term because even though the spirit and intent of the Settlement Agreement was for the parties to achieve closure within the stipulated time frame by LCM relinquishing his shareholding in the TL Companies in exchange for the Consideration, LSE refused to agree to the lowering of the reserve price for the auction of the FEP Unit from S$2.1m despite: (a) the FEP Unit having received no bids at multiple auctions at the reserve price of S$2.1m, and (b) Colliers having recommended a reserve price of S$1.6m on 16 February 2017 (see the GD at [53]–[54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On appeal, counsel for LSE, Ms Hui Choon Wai (“Ms Hui”), contends that LSE had not acted in breach of the Reasonable Endeavours Term by failing to agree to a lowering of the reserve price of the FEP Unit given that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, even if the reserve price was reduced from S$2.1m, there would not have been any offer to purchase the FEP Unit; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, LSE is not required to sacrifice the commercial interests of the TL Companies in satisfaction of his obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We reject Ms Hui’s submissions and affirm the Judge’s finding that LSE had breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term by failing to lower the reserve price for the auction of the FEP Unit from S$2.1m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">KS Energy Services Ltd v BR </span><span class="font-italic">Energy (M) Sdn Bhd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 905 (“<span class="font-italic">KS </span><span class="font-italic">Energy</span>”), this Court endorsed (at [46]) the interpretation of a “best endeavours” clause previously taken by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Travista</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 (“<span class="font-italic">Travista</span>”) at [27], and set out the following guidelines (at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The obligor has a duty to do everything reasonable in good faith with a view to procuring the contractually-stipulated outcome within the time allowed.

Although the Reasonable Endeavours Term does not expressly state that the parties are to take <span class="font-italic">all </span><span class="font-italic">reasonable endeavours</span> or take their <span class="font-italic">best </span><span class="font-italic">endeavours</span> to sell the FEP Unit, it does specifically require the parties to “<span class="font-italic">do all that may be necessary</span> to … implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement” [emphasis added] (see [23(a)] above). The Reasonable Endeavours Term should thus be construed to impose on the parties an obligation to take all reasonable endeavours or take their best endeavours to sell the FEP Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Applying the <span class="font-italic">KS </span><span class="font-italic">Energy </span>guidelines to the present facts, we find that LSE had breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term by failing to agree to lower the reserve price of the FEP Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 First, there is no evidence to support Ms Hui’s contention that even if the reserve price had been reduced from S$2.1m, there would still have been no offers to purchase the FEP Unit. The evidence shows that LSE had:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) refused to appoint a new agent to perform an alternative independent valuation of the FEP Unit after the six-month deadline provided for under cl 10(b) had elapsed (see [30] and [31] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) refused to lower the reserve price from S$2.1m even after the nine-month long-stop deadline provided for under cl 10(c) had elapsed (see [34] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) refused to lower the reserve price from S$2.1m to S$1.5m when LCM requested for LSE to do so on 10 January 2017 (see [40] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) declined to respond to the offer of S$1.1m made on 20 January 2017 (see [41] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) refused to lower the reserve price from S$2.1m to S$1.6m even after Colliers had recommended a revised reserve price of S$1.6m on 16 February 2017 (see [43] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) objected when LCM instructed Colliers on 17 February 2017 to auction the FEP Unit at the reserve price of S$1.1m (see [43] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) further refused to lower the reserve price from S$2.1m for the next six months even though no bids were received in any of the subsequent auctions at all (see [44] and [46] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It is significant that LSE had insisted on a high and unrealistic price to fix as the reserve price for the FEP Unit even though it was evident from at least the first six months of attempting to sell the FEP Unit that the property market at the material time was bearish. Most unacceptably, LSE first declined to appoint an alternative valuer for the FEP Unit when LCM first proposed this in July 2016, and subsequently refused to heed Colliers’ recommendation to lower the reserve price to S$1.6m in February 2017. In our judgment, this is clear evidence that LSE had failed to “do everything reasonable in good faith with a view to procuring the contractually-stipulated outcome within the time allowed”, given that he certainly did not take “all those reasonable steps which a prudent and determined man, acting in the interests of the <span class="font-italic">obligee</span> and anxious to procure the contractually stipulated outcome within the available time, would have taken” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">KS </span><span class="font-italic">Energy </span>at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Next, as for LSE’s assertion that the Reasonable Endeavours Term does not require him to sacrifice the commercial interests of the TL Companies in satisfaction of this term, this submission is, with respect, unmeritorious. In <span class="font-italic">KS </span><span class="font-italic">Energy</span>, this Court held<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [93(d)]) that: “[t]he obligor is not always required to sacrifice its own commercial interests in satisfaction of its obligations …, <span class="font-italic">but it may be required to do so where the nature and terms of the contract indicate that it is in the parties’ contemplation that the obligor should make such sacrifice</span>” [emphasis added]. In our judgment, this was a case where the nature and terms of the Settlement Agreement clearly indicated that it was in the parties’ contemplation that LSE should take the initiative to lower the reserve price when it was apparent that it was necessary for him to do so in order to sell the FEP Unit. This argument is therefore a complete non-starter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Accordingly, we are satisfied that the Judge rightly found that LSE had breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term by refusing to agree to lower the reserve price for the auction of the FEP Unit to below S$2.1m. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Costs Order Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Finally, the Judge held that LSE had breached cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement by failing to satisfy the Costs Order, given that: (a) the Costs Order plainly fell within the scope of the phrase “save for any costs orders already made”; and (b) it was illogical for cl 13 to be interpreted to supersede the orders made in the Winding Up Applications, including the Costs Order, as it would render both cll 1(b) and 13 otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We agree with the Judge’s reasoning. Based on the established principles of contractual interpretation (see [60]–[61] above), the Judge rightly first considered the text in question, and correctly, in our view, found cl 13 to be plain and unambiguous in conveying the meaning that the Costs Order, which was “already made” at the time of the Settlement Agreement, ought to be encompassed within the scope of the phrase “save for any costs orders already made”. The Judge next proceeded to consider the surrounding context, which included the other provisions in the Settlement Agreement, and was also correct, in our view, to hold that finding that cl 13 superseded the Costs Order would: (a) render cl 13 itself otiose, given that the parties would surely have known that no costs orders were made in the Winding Up Appeals at the time the Settlement Agreement was being drafted; and (b) render cl 1(b) redundant, given that if cl 13 only preserved a right to claim for costs orders in the Winding Up Appeals, cl 1(b) would be entirely unnecessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Ms Hui submits that the Judge had erred in his reasoning by disregarding the material parts of the evidence provided by LCM. We disagree. Considering the evidence provided by LCM at trial, it is clear that at the time the Settlement Agreement was entered into, LCM knew that he was entitled to the sum of S$40,000 as costs ordered to him for being successful in the Winding Up Applications (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Costs Order), and hence he should remain entitled to this even after the Settlement Agreement has been entered into:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: So you’re not able to say why this is inside the agreement, is it? I just need---I’m just trying to understand what was your---what was in your mind when you---</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[LCM]: To my mind that he had to pay me 40,000 first, then we go for---for the settlement agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: Right, but that didn’t happen.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[LCM]: It didn’t happen.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: Okay, so what is the implication of putting this in?

Civil Appeal No 204 of 2017</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">_____________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: CoA dismisses appeal by the appellant against HC decision to award the respondent damages for the appellant’s breach of various terms under a settlement agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1          This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to allow in part a claim brought by the respondent, Mr Lin Choo Mee (“LCM”), in a suit (“the Suit”) commenced against his elder brother, the appellant, Mr Lim Sze Eng (“LSE”), seeking, among other things, damages for the alleged breaches by LSE of various terms under a settlement agreement dated 28 December 2015 (“the Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement was entered into in resolution of their differences arising out of appeals (“the Winding Up Appeals”) brought by LSE against the decision of the High Court to grant applications (“the Winding Up Applications”) brought by LCM to wind up three family-run companies, namely, Tat Leong Investment Pte Ltd (“TL Investment”), Tat Leong Development (Pte) Ltd (“TL Development”), and Tat Leong Petroleum Co (Pte) Ltd (“TL Petroleum”) (collectively, “the TL Companies”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The material facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2          LSE is the founding director and majority shareholder of the TL Companies. On the other hand, LCM is a minority shareholder in the TL Companies, and used to be a director of the companies until his term as director in TL Development and TL Investment was not renewed in March 2013.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3          In November 2014, LCM commenced the Winding Up Applications, seeking to wind up the TL Companies under s 254(1)(<em>i</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). The High Court granted the applications, and ordered LSE to pay LCM costs fixed at S$40,000 excluding disbursements, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of LSE’s shares in the TL Companies (“the Costs Order”). LSE appealed against the decision. In November 2015, the Court of Appeal suggested that parties attend mediation to resolve their differences. On 28 December 2015, the parties attended mediation and, at the conclusion of the session, entered into the Settlement Agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4          The material terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">a          LCM’s shareholding in the TL Companies would be disposed of either by LSE purchasing LCM’s shareholding in those companies or by capital reduction of those companies, with the net effect being that LCM would receive a sum of money in lieu of his shares in the TL Companies (“the Consideration”), and each party shall bear their own costs of the Winding Up Appeals (cll 1 and 2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">b          The Consideration comprises: (i) 23.44% of the net tangible asset value (“NTAV”) of TL Development; and (ii) 14.81% of the NTAV of TL Petroleum (cl 3).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">c          One of the components of the NTAV of TL Petroleum is the sale price of a shop unit at 14 Scotts Road #03-11, Far East Plaza (“the FEP Unit”) (cl 5).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">d          The sale of the FEP Unit “is to be completed within six months” of the date of the Settlement Agreement, and the payment of the Consideration to LCM “shall be made … within 9 months hereof or within 1 month of the completion of sale of both [LCM’s place of residence] and [the FEP Unit], whichever is earlier” (cl 10).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">e          Neither party shall have any claim against the other in relation to any matter arising from or connected to the subject matter of the Winding Up Appeals, save for any costs orders already made (cl 13).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5          It was also allegedly common ground, based on the parties’ pleadings in the Suit, that the Settlement Agreement contains implied terms that: (a) first, the parties “shall take reasonable endeavours and/or do all that may be necessary to give effect to the spirit and intent of the Settlement Agreement and to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement”, and the “parties would cooperate to enable the sale of the [FEP Unit] and/or not to prevent performance of the sale of the [FEP Unit] by their acts and/or omissions” (“the Reasonable Endeavours Term”); and (b) second, “the sale price of the [FEP Unit] shall be reasonable” (“the Reasonable Price Term”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6          Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties appointed Colliers International (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”) as the agent for the sale of the FEP Unit. In March 2016, Colliers gave an indicative valuation of the FEP Unit of S$2.1–2.2m. In the first six months of 2016, the parties first marketed the FEP Unit for sale in the open market, and then put the FEP Unit up for auction at the reserve price of S$2.2m, but were unsuccessful. After the six-month deadline provided for under cl 10(b) for the sale of the FEP Unit elapsed on 28 June 2016, LCM proposed discharging Colliers as the agent for the sale of the FEP Unit and appointing another firm to perform an independent valuation. LSE refused, and instead proposed that the FEP Unit be auctioned at the slightly reduced reserve price of S$2.1m.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7          On 28 September 2016, the nine-month long-stop deadline provided under cl 10(c) for the payment of the Consideration to LCM elapsed. In October 2016, LCM agreed to auction the FEP Unit at the reserve price of S$2.1m until the end of 2016. But the auctions carried out in October, November and December 2016 were all unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8          In January 2017, LCM proposed to lower the reserve price of the FEP Unit for the auction to S$1.5m. LSE refused. At the auction held at the reserve price of S$2.1m on 19 January 2017, an offer of S$1.1m was made for the FEP Unit. But LSE did not accept the offer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9          In February 2017, Colliers provided, at LCM’s request, a fresh indicative valuation of the FEP Unit of S$2-2.2m, and also recommended a reserve price of S$1.6m. LCM then proposed to lower the reserve price to S$1.1m, but LSE refused, insisting on maintaining the reserve price of S$2.1m. Further auctions of the FEP Unit at the reserve price of S$2.1m held from February to July 2017 were also unsuccessful, with no bids received at all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10        To date, the FEP Unit remains unsold, the Consideration remains unpaid, and the Costs Order remains unsatisfied. In the Suit, the Judge found that LSE had breached: (a) cll 10(b) and 10(c) by failing to complete the sale of the FEP Unit by 28 June 2016 and failing to pay the Consideration to LCM by 28 September 2016; and (b) cl 13 by failing to satisfy the Costs Order. LSE appealed against the Judge’s decision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11        The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. First, the court disagreed with the Judge below by finding that LSE did <em>not</em> breach cll 10(b) and 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement by failing to sell the FEP Unit by 28 June 2016 and pay LCM the Consideration by 28 September 2016 because cll 10(b) and 10(c) did not impose an absolute obligation on him to do so. However, the court agreed with the Judge that LSE was in breach of the Reasonable Endeavours Term by refusing to lower the reserve price for the sale by auction of the FEP Unit to below S$2.1m, and that LSE was also in breach of cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement by failing to satisfy the Costs Order: at <strong>[53] </strong>and <strong>[85]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12        Clauses 10(b) and 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement do not impose absolute obligations on the parties. Although the text of the contract will undoubtedly be the first port of call for the court when interpreting a contract, the court should always proceed to examine the relevant context even if the relevant text appears, at first glance, to be plain and unambiguous. Hence, in this light, </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">counsel’s agreements in the pleadings in relation to the Reasonable Price Term shed additional (and very important) light on the context<strong><em> </em></strong>in which the Settlement Agreement in general and cll 10(b) and 10(c) in particular were entered into, by showing that cll 10(b) and 10(c) were <em>not</em><strong> </strong>intended by the parties to impose absolute<em> </em>obligations inasmuch as the specific timelines stipulated therein were not intended to be absolute so long as a reasonable price for the FEP Unit could not be achieved.</span><span> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The relevant context was one that not only embraced closure for the parties, but also ensured that their economic interests were safeguarded. Hence, there was in fact no contradiction or variation of any absolute obligation to sell the FEP Unit and pay the Consideration by the stipulated dates by the implication of the Reasonable Price Term: at <strong>[59]</strong>, <strong>[62] </strong>and<strong> [63]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13        Although the parties’ pleadings that were taken into account in aiding the court in ascertaining the context in which the Settlement Agreement was entered into were drafted <em>subsequent to</em> the time that the particular contract was entered into, the present case can set no general precedent in so far as future cases in this regard are concerned as it involved a highly unusual fact situation. In particular, the present evidence comprised an agreed set of pleadings between parties in an adversarial position. There was also no issue relating to the objective reliability of the material that established the truth of the averments in the pleadings. Indeed, even if the stringent criteria set out by this court in both <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 regarding the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of interpretation, and <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 193 regarding the requirements of civil procedure that must be met before extrinsic evidence may be relied on for the purpose of interpretation were taken into account, the evidence substantiating the relevant pleadings would in fact pass legal muster: at <strong>[68]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14        LSE had breached the Reasonable Endeavours Term by failing to lower the reserve price for the auction of the FEP Unit from S$2.1m. There was no evidence to support LSE’s contention that even if the reserve price had been reduced from S$2.1m, there would still have been no offers made to purchase the FEP Unit. Rather, the evidence showed that LSE had failed to do everything reasonable in good faith with a view to procuring the contractually-stipulated outcome within the time allowed, given that he did not take all those reasonable steps which a prudent and determined man, acting in the interests of the obligee and anxious to procure the contractually stipulated outcome within the available time, would have taken. Also, it was incorrect for LSE to argue that the Reasonable Endeavours Term did not require him to sacrifice the commercial interests of the TL Companies. This was a case where the nature and terms of the Settlement Agreement clearly indicated that it was in the parties’ contemplation that LSE should take the initiative to lower the reserve price when it was apparent that it was necessary for him to do so in order to sell the FEP Unit: at <strong>[72]</strong>,<strong> [76]</strong> to <strong>[80]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15        LSE had breached cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement by failing to satisfy the Costs Order. The text of cl 13 was plain and unambiguous in conveying the meaning that the Costs Order, which was “already made” at the time of the Settlement Agreement, ought to be encompassed within the scope of the phrase “save for any costs orders already made”. The surrounding context also supported this reading, because finding that cl 13 superseded the Costs Order would render cl 13 itself otiose and render cl 1(b), which provides that each party shall bear their own costs of the Winding Up Appeals, redundant. Finally, the evidence provided by LCM at trial also showed that at the time the Settlement Agreement was entered into, LCM knew that he was entitled to the sum of S$40,000 as costs ordered to him for being successful in the Winding Up Applications, and hence he should remain entitled to the Costs Order even after the Settlement Agreement had been entered into: at <strong>[81] </strong>to<strong> [84]</strong>.</span></p>
