        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal, arising from Suit No 238 of
                    2007 (“Suit 238/07”), concerned the validity of a will made
                    on 21 August 1996 (“the 1996 Will”) by Madam Goh Hun
                    Keong (“Mdm Goh”). Prior to the making of the 1996 Will,
                    Mdm Goh had made another will dated 16 March 1989 (“the 1989
                    Will”). The appellant, and propounder of the 1996 Will, in these
                    proceedings was Muriel Chee (“Muriel”), a daughter of
                    Mdm Goh. The respondent was Caroline Chee (“Caroline”),
                    another daughter of Mdm Goh. The trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    had declared the 1996 Will invalid (see <em>Chee Mu Lin Muriel v
                        Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another,
                        interveners)</em> [2009] SGHC 229 (“the Judgment”)).
                    Muriel appealed against the Judge’s decision. We heard the appeal on
                    18 March 2010 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mdm Goh was born on 2 February 1921
                    and died on 9 June 2004 from renal failure. She was married to Dr Chee
                    Siew Oon (“Dr Chee”), who died in 1990. They had six
                    children. In order of seniority, they are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chee Ping Chian, Alexander
                        (“Alexander”), the first intervener;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chee Man Lin, Maureen
                        (“Maureen”), the second intervener;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chee Ping Kong (“Ping
                        Kong”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chee Ping Swee (“Ping Swee”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     Muriel; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     Caroline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Alexander, Maureen and Ping Kong ordinarily
                    resided in the United States of America (“the USA”) while Ping
                    Swee, Muriel and Caroline ordinarily resided in Singapore. Muriel was a lawyer.
                    Caroline was a doctor married to Paul Chew Tec Kuan (“Paul”), also
                    a doctor. Caroline was Mdm Goh’s favourite child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mdm Goh was an English teacher, and after
                    retirement, enjoyed much success in investing in property. After she died, her
                    assets became the subject of the present dispute (see the Judgment at [24]), in
                    particular a property at No 470 Holland Road (“the Holland Road
                    House”) which was the most valuable property in her estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mdm Goh was a very forceful person and had
                    a strong will, and would often ignore the feelings of her children and treat
                    them unfairly. On 16 March 1989, Mdm Goh executed the 1989 Will
                    appointing Caroline, who was her favourite daughter, as the sole executrix of
                    her estate and bequeathed to her almost the entire residuary estate including,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the Holland Road House (excluding
                    $150,000 in cash which was bequeathed to Ping Swee). The 1989 Will was drafted
                    and its execution witnessed by a lawyer frequently employed by Mdm Goh
                    since the early 1980s, Mr Hin Hoo Sing (“Mr Hin”) and a
                    clerk, Lim Bee Leng, both of M/s Hin Rai &amp; Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Prior to 1993, Mdm Goh lived with Ping Swee
                    and his wife in the Holland Road House. When they moved out sometime in 1993,
                    Mdm Goh moved into Muriel’s home at No 7 Greenleaf Place
                    (“Greenleaf Place”). During this period, Caroline and Paul were
                    looking for a residence of their own. Mdm Goh expressed her intention of
                    transferring the Holland Road House to them by way of gift. This led to a
                    disagreement between Caroline and Muriel, who felt strongly against Mdm Goh
                    leaving such a large part of her estate to Caroline. Muriel wrote a letter to
                    Alexander dated 25 June 1994 (“the 25 June 1994
                    letter”), the contents of which are set out at [37] of the Judgment,
                    venting her frustration and proposing an equal distribution of
                    Mdm Goh’s assets in a manner which, as will be seen, is very similar
                    to the terms of the 1996 Will. She warned Alexander against showing the
                    25 June 1994 letter to Mdm Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mdm Goh eventually sold a half-share in the
                    Holland Road House to Caroline and Paul for $2.5m on 12 June 1995, despite
                    Muriel’s objections. Only $1.34m of the purchase price was actually paid,
                    though Mdm Goh had acknowledged receipt of the remainder sum on
                    15 June 1995. Consequently, the Holland Road House was held in the names of
                    Caroline, Paul and Mdm Goh as tenants in common with Caroline and Paul
                    holding a half-share and Mdm Goh holding the other half-share. At around
                    the time of the sale, Mdm Goh returned to Singapore from the USA and stayed
                    in an apartment with her maid, San San Myint (“San San”), while
                    the Holland Road House was being renovated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mdm Goh became unwell and saw a number of
                    doctors from 1995 onwards. In addition to consulting her regular geriatrician,
                    Dr Lee Kng Swan (“Dr KS Lee”), Mdm Goh also
                    consulted Prof Lee Kok Onn (“Prof KO Lee”), an
                    endocrinologist and physician. In November 1995, Prof KO Lee diagnosed
                    Mdm Goh as suffering from an early onset of both Parkinson’s disease
                    and dementia, for which he prescribed two drugs, Selegiline and Tacrine. In
                    February 1996, Caroline brought Mdm Goh to visit a psychiatrist,
                    Prof Kua Ee Heok (“Prof Kua”), after Mdm Goh
                    complained of a lack of concentration and memory loss. Prof Kua made a
                    provisional diagnosis of “depression, to exclude dementia” based
                    on Mdm Goh’s poor short-term memory and her uncertainty as to what
                    the year, month, day or date was. He prescribed three drugs: Haloperidol to
                    reduce her symptoms of delusions; Stilnox, which is a type of sleeping pill; and
                    Sertraline, an anti-depressant. In March 1996, Prof Kua administered the
                    “Elderly Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire”
                    (“ECAQ”) on Mdm Goh, which was a test for short-term memory loss,
                    poor concentration and orientation, although it was not a diagnostic test for
                    dementia. He diagnosed Mdm Goh as having Alzheimer’s disease and
                    progressively poor memory. At his direction, Mdm Goh underwent a computed
                    tomography scan in April 1996 (“the CT scan”), which showed the
                    presence of multiple lacunar infarcts in her brain. Based on the CT scan,
                    Prof Kua diagnosed Mdm Goh as suffering from a combination of
                    Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. He prescribed Tacrine for these
                    conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 10 August 1996, Mdm Goh fell in the
                    driveway of the Holland Road House and suffered lacerations to her head. She was
                    treated by Dr John Isaac (“Dr Isaac”) at the National
                    University Hospital, where she was discharged after observation overnight
                    because Dr Isaac found her to be alert and oriented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 18 August 1996, Muriel, Ms May Oh
                    (“MO”) and Dr Goh King Hua (“Dr Goh”) met
                    with Mdm Goh at the Holland Road House. MO is an advocate and solicitor.
                    MO’s father was a cousin of Dr Chee, Mdm Goh’s late husband.
                    Dr Goh was Mdm Goh’s nephew and a general practitioner in
                    medicine. The day after this meeting, Muriel faxed two documents to MO
                    containing instructions for the preparation of the 1996 Will. The first document
                    sent on 19 August 1996 contained a list of names of Mdm Goh’s
                    children (“the First Fax”) while the second document (“the
                    Second Fax”) sent on 21 August 1996 contained suggestions of terms
                    to be included in the 1996 Will. The Second Fax also contained (a) a
                    handwritten note by Muriel stating “Please consider the following ideas
                    and call me if you need further clarification”; and (b) two
                    handwritten amendments made by MO to the terms suggested therein to replace MO
                    or “W” (who was Ms Wee Eng Hua, MO’s partner in her law
                    firm) with Dr Goh’s wife as executor of the will and to allow
                    Caroline and Paul one year, instead of six months, after Mdm Goh’s
                    death to purchase Mdm Goh’s remaining half-share in the Holland Road
                    House.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 19 August 1996, Mdm Goh paid a brief
                    visit to Prof KO Lee where he recommended that she see a neurologist,
                    Dr Benjamin Ong (“Dr Ong”), based on the multiple
                    lacunar infarcts he observed in the CT scan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 21 August 1996, three days after the
                    meeting at the Holland Road House, MO and Dr Goh witnessed the execution of
                    the 1996 Will by Mdm Goh at Greenleaf Place, Muriel’s residence.
                    Muriel was in another room during the execution of the will. It is not disputed
                    that it was MO who drafted the 1996 Will. Under the terms of the 1996 Will,
                    Caroline and Paul were given the option to purchase Mdm Goh’s
                    remaining half-share in the Holland Road House at the “prevailing market
                    price” within one year of Mdm Goh’s death, and the residuary estate
                    was to be divided among Mdm Goh’s other children, namely, Alexander,
                    Maureen, Ping Kong, Ping Swee and Muriel. Clause 2.1 of the 1996 Will
                    further explained that the dispositions were so made because Caroline and Paul
                    had been sold a half-share of the Holland Road House at a “discounted
                    price of $2.5 million in 1995”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In early September 1996, Prof Kua took
                    Mdm Goh off Sertraline, Stilnox, Haloperidol and Tacrine because of his
                    suspicion that these drugs had contributed to her falls. A week later, Mdm Goh
                    visited Dr Ong, who noted that Mdm Goh exhibited abnormal gait and
                    palmomental reflexes. Separately, Muriel brought Mdm Goh to see another
                    geriatrician, Dr Chan Kin Ming (“Dr Chan”), in November
                    1996. Dr Chan conducted an ECAQ as well as a clock completion test on
                    Mdm Goh. He informed Muriel and Mdm Goh that Mdm Goh’s
                    scores were consistent with cognitive impairment, of which dementia was a cause.
                    Based on her medical history, Dr Chan assessed that Mdm Goh’s
                    falls were a result of her being over-medicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Subsequently, Mdm Goh did several things
                    which showed that her mental faculties had improved considerably. On
                    8 December 1996 at MO’s house, Mdm Goh signed an instrument
                    prepared by W granting Muriel a power of attorney over her affairs (“the
                    1996 POA”). This 1996 POA was subsequently revoked by Mdm Goh by an
                    instrument of revocation on 14 January 1997 (“the POA
                    Revocation”) after Mdm Goh found out that Muriel had attempted to
                    obtain information on the prior sale of a half-share in the Holland Road House
                    to Caroline and Paul. The POA Revocation was prepared by Mr Hin and signed
                    at his office. Mr Hin also recorded an unsigned statement by Mdm Goh
                    stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that she was not quite clear
                    about the powers she had given to Muriel and that she was willing to give half
                    of the Holland Road House to Caroline. It was not clear whether this statement
                    relating to the gift referred to the half-share she had already transferred to
                    Caroline and Paul or the remaining half-share owned by her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 22 January 1999, Mdm Goh executed
                    an instrument granting a power of attorney to Caroline (“the First 1999
                    POA”). The First 1999 POA was witnessed by Mr Hin and Dr KS
                    Lee, who gave the opinion that Mdm Goh possessed the requisite mental
                    capacity at that time. On 2 March 1999, Mdm Goh executed another power
                    of attorney in favour of Muriel for the limited purpose of collecting rents for
                    one of Mdm Goh’s properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Following Mdm Goh’s death on
                    9 June 2004, Mr Hin notified the Chee family (except Ping Kong) that
                    there would be a reading of the 1989 Will at his office. On 28 June 2004,
                    Mr Hin read the 1989 Will in the presence of Alexander, Maureen, Ping Swee
                    and Caroline. Muriel (who was notified of the reading) and Ping Kong did not
                    attend the reading of the 1989 Will. Instead, on 30 June 2004, Muriel
                    invited Alexander and Ping Swee to Greenleaf Place where the 1996 Will was read.
                    Muriel’s lawyer, Ms Quek Peck Hong (“Ms Quek”),
                    was also present at this reading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 13 July 2004, Caroline filed a
                    Petition in Probate No 141 of 2004 for a grant of probate of the 1989 Will.
                    Probate was granted on 26 July 2004. However, on 2 August 2004, Muriel
                    lodged a caveat, Caveat against Grant of Probate No 160 of 2004, against
                    the sealing of the grant of probate to Caroline on the ground that she had an
                    interest in the estate of Mdm Goh under the 1996 Will. In response, Caroline
                    filed a Warning to Caveator on 26 August 2004, to which Muriel entered an
                    Appearance to Caveat on 7 September 2004. This led to the filing of Suit
                    238/07 on 12 April 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The issues that came before the Judge for
                    determination were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Mdm Goh had the
                        testamentary capacity to execute the 1996 Will;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Mdm Goh knew and approved of the
                        contents of the 1996 Will; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether Mdm Goh executed the 1996 Will under
                        Muriel’s influence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the first two issues, the
                    Judge held on the evidence that Mdm Goh did not have testamentary capacity
                    and did not know or approve the contents of the 1996 Will when she executed it.
                    Consequently, it was unnecessary for the Judge to consider the third
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Four groups of witnesses testified on behalf
                    of the opposing parties: (a) the medical experts; (b) the Chee
                    siblings; (c) the persons who were present at Greenleaf Place on
                    21 August 1996 when Mdm Goh signed the 1996 Will; and (d) other
                    factual witnesses to Mdm Goh’s state of mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The medical experts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Five doctors, <em>viz</em>, Prof KO Lee, Prof Kua, Dr Ong, Dr Chan
                    and Dr Yeh Ing Berne (“Dr Yeh”), a neuro-radiologist,
                    testified on the medical condition of Mdm Goh on behalf of Caroline.
                    Muriel, on her part, relied on the expert opinions of two doctors, <em>viz</em>, Dr Tan Chue Tin (“Dr Tan”),
                    a psychiatrist, and Dr KS Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Dr KS Lee, Mdm Goh’s
                    geriatrician, could not testify as she had died earlier in 2006, but her medical
                    notes were admitted in evidence. Dr KS Lee’s medical notes showed
                    that the results of Mdm Goh’s CT scan were normal. This conclusion
                    was contradicted by Dr Yeh who interpreted the CT scan to show shrinkage or
                    atrophy of Mdm Goh’s frontal lobes that was unlikely to be caused by
                    old age, which meant there was a reasonable chance that Mdm Goh had
                    dementia. Similarly, Prof KO Lee, Prof Kua and Dr Ong opined,
                    based on their clinical observations, tests and the CT scan, that Mdm Goh
                    suffered from some degree of dementia consistent with Alzheimer’s disease,
                    as well as over-medication from the drugs she was taking, especially
                    Haloperidol, in August 1996. As a result, they opined that Mdm Goh
                    lacked the ability to concentrate or think clearly and therefore lacked the
                    testamentary capacity to execute the 1996 Will. Dr Chan did not adopt the
                    diagnosis of dementia, but opined that Mdm Goh suffered from cognitive
                    impairment in August 1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the other hand, Dr Tan, who had not
                    treated Mdm Goh personally, opined from his examination of the medical
                    reports of Prof Kua, Dr KS Lee and Dr Chan as well as from
                    interviewing Muriel, Dr Goh and Ping Swee that the tests conducted by the
                    other medical experts and their reports were inconclusive as to whether
                    Mdm Goh suffered from dementia or a cognitive impairment in August 1996.
                    Instead, in his opinion, given to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,
                    Mdm Goh possessed the requisite testamentary capacity in August 1996 when
                    she executed the 1996 Will. He gave the following reasons for his opinion:
                    (a) dementia was a progressive illness which would not deprive a person of
                    testamentary capacity in its early stages; (b) Mdm Goh had
                    participated in significant financial and legal transactions both before and
                    after August 1996; and (c) the medication prescribed to Mdm Goh and
                    the injuries she had suffered from her fall on 10 August 1996 were unlikely
                    to have affected her mental capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Chee siblings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Muriel’s testimony may be summarised as
                    follows: in August 1996, Mdm Goh was mentally alert and capable of making
                    her own decisions; Mdm Goh had instructed MO to prepare a draft of the 1996
                    Will on 18 August 1996, and her (Muriel’s) role was to liaise
                    with MO on the matter; Mdm Goh had explained to her that she had sold a
                    half-share in the Holland Road House to Caroline and Paul at a discount –
                    they paid $2.5m when they should have paid $4.5m; for this reason, Caroline
                    would get nothing from her estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Ping Swee’s testimony was that
                    Mdm Goh had not intended to bequeath the majority of her estate to
                    Caroline. Her true intention was for all her children to be included in the
                    distribution of her assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Alexander and Maureen testified that Caroline
                    had always been Mdm Goh’s favourite child and that Mdm Goh had
                    begun to suffer from delusions around the years 1994 to 1995. Alexander also
                    testified that Muriel had earlier told him not to tell Maureen and Caroline of
                    the existence of the 1996 Will, and that at the reading of the 1996 Will, Muriel
                    had told him that it was a preliminary meeting to see how Alexander and Ping
                    Swee felt about it, and that she would withdraw the 1996 Will if they were
                    unhappy about it. He also disclosed that Ms Quek, the solicitor in
                    attendance, then explained that the 1996 Will could not be ignored once it had
                    surfaced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Caroline’s testimony may be summarised
                    as follows: (a) she was Mdm Goh’s favourite child because she
                    did not marry a foreigner; (b) Mdm Goh had suggested that she and Paul
                    live with her at the Holland Road House instead of buying a new apartment;
                    (c) Mdm Goh also suggested transferring the Holland Road House to her as a
                    gift since it would be hers eventually; (d) she had declined
                    Mdm Goh’s offer and instead suggested buying a half-share of the
                    Holland Road House at market value, determined to be $2.5m, and Mdm Goh had
                    accepted the suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The witnesses at Greenleaf Place</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     MO’s testimony may be summarised as
                    follows: she could not recall the meeting on 18 August 1996, but admitted
                    she had drafted the 1996 Will on instructions from Muriel on behalf of
                    Mdm Goh. On the evening of 21 August 1996, she had met with
                    Mdm Goh, W, Dr Goh and Muriel at Greenleaf Place. While Muriel was in
                    another room, MO read the 1996 Will line by line to Mdm Goh, who nodded and
                    appeared to understand what was being said. According to MO, Mdm Goh
                    appeared to be a capable testatrix and read the 1996 Will on her own. Under
                    cross-examination, MO maintained that the amendments suggested in the Second Fax
                    were instructions from Mdm Goh, albeit given by Muriel. MO added that it
                    was her usual practice to ask a testator if the testator understood the terms of
                    the will, and that she would not have signed off as a witness if this step was
                    not taken. However, she did not see the need to question Mdm Goh further in this
                    case because of her impression that Mdm Goh was a shrewd businesswoman who
                    could understand the 1996 Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Dr Goh’s testimony may be
                    summarised as follows. He was requested by Muriel to pay a social visit to
                    Mdm Goh at Greenleaf Place on 18 August 1996 because of
                    Mdm Goh’s deteriorating health. He could not give details of what had
                    been discussed there beyond Mdm Goh’s health and family matters in
                    general. He testified that Mdm Goh, Muriel or MO had mentioned making a
                    will at the end of the conversation but he did not know what was to be in the
                    will as the subject was not discussed in his presence. Subsequently, Dr Goh
                    received a call and was asked by Muriel to visit Mdm Goh again because her
                    will was ready. He had assumed that he was to be a witness to the signing of the
                    will. He confirmed that he was present with W when MO was reading the 1996 Will
                    line by line to Mdm Goh on the evening of 21 August 1996 at Greenleaf
                    Place. Dr Goh also testified that Mdm Goh appeared to be behaving
                    normally, showed no signs of drowsiness and signed on every page of the 1996
                    Will after reading it herself. Dr Goh admitted that he was casually
                    chatting with W while the 1996 Will was being read, and further stated that
                    he only realised that he was named as an executor on that day when he read the
                    1996 Will for the first time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     W corroborated the evidence of MO and of
                    Dr Goh that Mdm Goh had appeared to be a capable testatrix who
                    understood the contents of the 1996 Will. Like MO, W stated that her usual
                    practice would have been to ask questions to satisfy herself that the testatrix
                    knew what she was signing. However, W also admitted that she could not recall
                    when she had first read the 1996 Will or if any questions were asked during its
                    signing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The other witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Various other witnesses were called to
                    establish Mdm Goh’s state of mind at the material time.
                    Mdm Goh’s maid San San testified that Mdm Goh suffered from
                    delusions in early 1996 – she accused San San of sleeping with the late
                    Dr Chee and Paul. Mdm Goh’s private nurse, Sarah Jessica Leong,
                    testified that she noticed Mdm Goh behaving strangely from the time she was
                    employed in 1998. Dr Chuah Chin Teck (“Dr Chuah”)
                    testified that he had accompanied Mdm Goh on a flight to the USA in April
                    1998 and had observed that she was disoriented and had put utensils and even the
                    serving tray into her bag. Muriel, on her part, called Ping Swee’s
                    daughter, Anthea Chee, who was on the flight with Dr Chuah and Mdm Goh, to
                    testify that Mdm Goh’s behaviour then was not out of the
                    ordinary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s evaluation of the evidence presented
                below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In summary, the Judge accepted the evidence of
                    the medical experts called by Caroline and the evidence of the other witnesses
                    who had testified that Mdm Goh suffered from delusions around the material
                    time. In particular, she accepted the evidence of Prof Kua and Dr Ong
                    who had testified that Mdm Goh was suffering from dementia in August 1996
                    and noted that their findings were consistent with the results of the CT scan,
                    various tests and the doctors’ own clinical observations through their
                    interaction with Mdm Goh throughout the same period. The Judge rejected the
                    opinions of Dr Tan and Dr KS Lee (see the Judgment at
                    [141]–[142]), holding that Dr KS Lee’s conclusion that
                    Mdm Goh’s CT scan results were normal was shown to be erroneous by
                    Dr Yeh, whose opinion also discredited Dr Tan’s opinion which
                    was based on second hand reports (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                    above). The Judge also dismissed Dr Isaac’s evidence that
                    Mdm Goh was alert as immaterial on the ground that he was not treating
                    Mdm Goh for dementia but merely checking if it was safe for her to be
                    discharged from hospital after her fall. The Judge accepted that
                    Mdm Goh’s fall which caused an injury to her head was one of the
                    factors that indicated Mdm Goh’s lack of testamentary capacity. The
                    Judge also accepted the evidence of Maureen, Alexander, San San, Dr Chuah
                    and Sarah Jessica Leong that Mdm Goh was disoriented or delusional.
                    However, she did not accept the evidence of Anthea Chee on Mdm Goh’s
                    behaviour on the plane as she was only seven years old then (see the
                    Judgment at [201]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Judge also found as a fact that
                    Mdm Goh had no knowledge and did not approve of the contents of the 1996
                    Will. She concluded that there were circumstances surrounding the execution of
                    the 1996 Will which aroused suspicion as to whether it expressed the true
                    intentions of Mdm Goh, <em>eg</em>, (a) Caroline
                    was Mdm Goh’s favourite child to whom she had always intended to
                    bequeath her residuary estate, and yet she was excluded from the 1996 Will;
                    (b) Muriel had hastily procured the drafting and execution of the 1996 Will
                    under which she became one of the beneficiaries when previously she was left
                    out; (c) the terms of the 1996 Will mirrored the terms proposed by Muriel
                    in the 25 June 1994 letter; (d) MO could recall the signing of the
                    1996 Will on 21 August 1996 but not the meeting on 18 August 1996 or
                    the signing of the 1996 POA at her place on 8 December 1996;
                    (e) Dr Goh’s testimony that Mdm Goh had signed every page
                    of the 1996 Will when this was not the case; (f) neither MO nor Dr Goh
                    could recall their conversation with Mdm Goh on 18 August 1996
                    during which the instructions for the 1996 Will were alleged (by Muriel) to have
                    been given (see the Judgment at [156]–[160]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     With respect to the evidence of MO and Muriel
                    on how and who gave instructions for the preparation of the 1996 Will, the Judge
                    found that there were serious discrepancies in their evidence. Muriel’s
                    evidence was that MO had given advice to Mdm Goh on how to distribute her
                    assets in a “fair” manner, and that Mdm Goh had instructed MO
                    to draft the 1996 Will after having discussed the terms with her. But,
                    MO’s evidence was that she could not recall the meeting with Mdm Goh
                    on 18 August 1996. MO also did not make attendance notes either during or
                    after the meeting. Their evidence showed that it was Muriel who had consulted MO
                    on the provisions to include in the 1996 Will, and that Mdm Goh had nothing
                    to do with those instructions. Furthermore, Dr Goh who was named as an
                    executor was not told about it and he only found out when he read the 1996 Will,
                    just before its execution by Mdm Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Judge also considered the events
                    subsequent to the signing of the 1996 Will, such as Muriel’s failure to
                    attend the reading of the 1989 Will and the statements she had made during the
                    reading of the 1996 Will to reinforce her finding that the 1996 Will was
                    invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the light of her findings of facts as
                    summarised above, the Judge held that Muriel failed to prove that
                    (a) Mdm Goh had testamentary capacity when she signed the 1996 Will;
                    and (b) Mdm Goh knew or approved of the contents of the 1996 Will when
                    she signed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On appeal, Muriel challenged both findings of
                    the Judge, namely, that Mdm Goh had no testamentary capacity and that she
                    did not know or understand the terms of the 1996 Will when she signed it. Before
                    we deal with her arguments on these two issues, it is desirable that we set out
                    the relevant principles of law in relation to testamentary
                capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on testamentary capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The relevant principles are established. For a
                    will to be found valid, the testator must (a) have the mental capacity to
                    make a will; (b) have knowledge and approval of the contents of the will;
                    and (c) be free from undue influence or the effects of fraud. The leading
                    authority in this area of the law is the decision in <em>Banks v
                        Goodfellow</em> (1870) LR 5 QB 549 (“<em>Banks</em>”) which has been followed by our courts. The
                    essential requisites of testamentary capacity were recently restated in
                        <em>George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 631 (“<em>George Abraham</em>”)
                    at [29] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the testator understands the nature of the act and
                            what its consequences are;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    he knows the extent of his property of which he is
                            disposing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    he knows who his beneficiaries are and can
                            appreciate their claims to his property; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    he is free from an abnormal state of mind
                                (<em>eg</em>, delusions) that might distort
                            feelings or judgments relevant to making the will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Judge has helpfully restated the law that
                    in applying the test in <em>Banks</em>, the court must look
                    at the totality of the evidence as a whole, comprising of both factual
                    (including evidence of friends and relatives who had the opportunity to observe
                    the testator) and medical components. The court should generally accord equal
                    importance and weight to both types of evidence, so long as both the factual and
                    medical witnesses had the opportunity to observe the testator at the material
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is important to bear in mind that whether
                    the testator had the mental capacity to understand the nature of a will and its
                    consequences is only one element of testamentary capacity and this element is
                    not necessarily determined by the existence of some form of mental impairment.
                    In <em>Banks</em> at 566, Cockburn LJ said that
                    though a testator’s mental power may be reduced by physical infirmity or
                    the decay of advancing age to below the ordinary standard, he might still retain
                    sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the testamentary
                    act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The propounder of the will bears the burden of
                    proving that the testator possessed testamentary capacity. This will <em>prima facie</em> be established by the due execution of the
                    will in ordinary circumstances where the testator was not known to be suffering
                    from any kind of mental disability. An indication of testamentary capacity would
                    be the rationality of the will having regard to its terms and the identities of
                    the beneficiaries (see also <em>George Abraham</em> at
                    [33]–[36] and [67]). The party challenging the will may rebut this
                    presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary, such as evidence that the
                    testator was suffering from a mental illness that was serious enough for the
                    court to find that the testator lacked testamentary capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The court must then consider the evidence as a
                    whole. If a testator is shown to have suffered from an <em>incapacitating</em> mental illness prior to the execution of the will
                    that resulted in a loss of testamentary capacity, then it may be presumed that
                    the testator <em>continued</em> to lack testamentary
                    capacity up till the time of the will’s execution. This proposition,
                    however, does not fundamentally alter the propounder’s burden of showing
                    that such illness had not affected the testator’s testamentary capacity at
                    the time of the execution of the will. Instead, the inquiry will turn to whether
                    a lack of testamentary capacity could be inferred from the existence of the
                    mental illness and whether, despite the illness, the testator was lucid at the
                    execution of the will, although the severity of the illness may influence the
                    threshold of proof required. As stated in <em>George
                        Abraham</em> at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, the presumption referred to in para (b) of the above
                        quote can only arise in a case where the serious mental illness is
                        sufficient to cause testamentary incapacity. It is only in such a case that
                        a continuation of the mental illness results in a continuation of the lack
                        of testamentary capacity. In other words, the lack of testamentary capacity
                        must first exist before it can continue. The presumption in that passage
                        from <em>Theobald on Wills</em> refers to the
                        continuance of an incapacitating serious illness. For example, if on Day 10
                        the testator has no testamentary capacity and he makes a will on Day 15, the
                        presumption arises that the illness has continued with his inherent lack of
                        testamentary capacity. The statement does not mean that, because a testator
                        has a serious illness, it must follow that he lacks, or is presumed to lack,
                        testamentary capacity. After all, he may have lucid intervals. That
                        condition has to be shown as inferable from his mental illness. When
                        analysed in this way, the presumption adds nothing to the burden of proof
                        which is placed on the propounder of the will. When faced with an allegation
                        that the testator was seriously ill when he made the will, the propounder
                        has to show that the illness had not affected the testator's testamentary
                        capacity. That is why <em>Theobald on Wills</em> goes
                        on to state that the person propounding the will may rebut the presumption
                        by establishing that the testator made the will during a lucid interval or
                        after recovery from the illness. In my view, the more serious the illness
                        prior to the making of the will is, the higher should be the threshold of
                        proof, and, conversely, the less serious the illness, the lower the
                        threshold of proof. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This inquiry remains a judicial function.
                    Medical evidence will often be necessary to establish the mental capacity of the
                    testator, but not surprisingly, medical evidence is often conflicting (as was
                    the case in the present proceedings and in <em>George
                        Abraham</em>). However, the existence of a serious mental illness at
                    the material time does not completely address the issue of testamentary
                    capacity, a related but distinct question which includes the other requisites.
                    It is ultimately for the court to decide whether the testator had testamentary
                    capacity at the relevant time on the evidence before the court, including the
                    opinions of medical experts and non-medical testimony on the behaviour of the
                    testator before, during or after the execution of the will. Abdicating this
                    fact-finding role to the experts would be contrary to the judicial function (see
                        <em>George Abraham</em> at [36] and [64]–[65]).
                    In this regard, two cases involving mental competency as an element in
                    determining the testamentary capacity of a testator suffering from dementia may
                    be mentioned. In <em>Norris v Tuppen</em> [1999]
                    VSC 228 (unreported), Ashley J commented at [335]–[336]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Expert (medical) evidence may be important in determining competency. But
                        it does not decide the issue, any more than does the mere fact of the age of
                        the testatrix when the will was made, or the opinions of the attesting
                        witnesses that the testatrix was competent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The presence of dementia does not necessarily tell against a testatrix
                        having competency. Dementia may manifest itself in imperfect recollection,
                        yet leave intact the awareness and ability to which I have referred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Despite these comments, Ashley J found on the evidence that the
                    testatrix lacked testamentary capacity because she exhibited many misconceptions
                    and misrepresentations of events, which agreed with the medical evidence of her
                    mental incapacity arising from dementia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Cattermole v
                        Prisk</em> [2006] 1 FLR 693 (“<em>Cattermole v Prisk</em>”), Norris J reached the
                    conclusion (at [75]) that a testatrix who was suffering from “some memory
                    loss and from the early stages of dementia” nevertheless possessed mental
                    capacity. In that case, a widow revoked an existing will which provided a number
                    of legacies to her family, and made a new will bequeathing most of her estate to
                    a man who had become her companion and caregiver. Subsequently, the widow made a
                    further gift to the man shortly before she died. Despite the widow suffering
                    from some memory loss and early stage dementia, Norris J held that she had
                    testamentary capacity when she made the new will because of the witnesses’
                    evidence that she could communicate coherently and was able to search for and
                    accurately find information. The further gift, however, was made when the widow
                    lacked mental capacity and was therefore set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case, the Judge correctly held
                    that common law principles applied. However, it may be noted that similar
                    principles have presently been enacted in the Mental Capacity Act
                    (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) which came into force on 1 March 2010. In
                    particular, s 4 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-1">The definition of the expression ‘unable to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The wording of s 4(1) makes it clear that
                    the determinative issue is whether the person is able to make a decision for
                    himself notwithstanding that he may be suffering from an impairment of or
                    disturbance in the functioning of his mind. The medical condition establishing
                    the impairment or disturbance would not by itself conclude the matter. Instead,
                    the statutory regime envisages another step in the inquiry which asks: does this
                    medical condition have the effect of preventing the person from making a
                    decision? In this aspect, the principles enunciated in the new statutory regime
                    are consistent with the common law principles set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Once testamentary capacity has been
                    established, a rebuttable presumption arises that the testator knew and approved
                    of the contents of the will at the time of execution. While the legal burden of
                    proof lies at all times with the propounder of the will, the evidential burden
                    of proof shifts in ordinary circumstances to the opponent of the will to rebut
                    this presumption. However, it is necessary to note that under established law,
                    the presumption does not arise where there were circumstances surrounding the
                    execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will
                    (or some provision in it) did not express the mind of the testator (see
                    generally <em>Barry v Butlin</em> (1838) 12 ER 1089
                        (“<em>Butlin</em>”) at 1090; <em>R Mahendran and another v R Arumuganathan</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 166 (“<em>Mahendran</em>”) at
                    [15]; <em>Tan Teck Khong v Tan Pian Meng</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 490 at [162]). The circumstances to be considered include only
                    those “attending, or are at least relevant to, the preparation and
                    execution of the will itself” (see <em>W. Scott Fulton,
                        Isabella D. Fulton and Margaret Fulton v Charles Batty Andrew and Thomas
                        Wilson</em> (1874–1875) LR 7 HL 448 (“<em>Fulton</em>”) at 471). In <em>Mahendran</em>, this court stated at [129] that any circumstance
                    which had nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the will were to
                    be disregarded. However, it may be noted that in the case of <em>In the Estate of Musgrove</em> [1927] P 264, Lawrence LJ
                    said at 286 that although the circumstances to be considered would generally
                    comprise contemporaneous events, they might also include events subsequent to
                    the execution of the will. In the present case, the Judge was of the view that
                    all forms of suspicious circumstances ought to be considered. We agreed with the
                    Judge. In the present case the conduct of Muriel in connection with the
                    respective readings of the 1989 Will and the 1996 Will gave the impression,
                    which the Judge took into account, that she herself did not believe that the
                    1996 Will represented the actual state of mind of Mdm Goh in relation to the
                    disposition of her properties, especially her half-share in the Holland Road
                    House.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We agreed with the Judge’s observation
                    (see the Judgment at [136]) that there is no magical formula (comprising a
                    certain fixed number of factors or criteria) to ascertain whether the
                    circumstances surrounding a Will are suspicious. The degree of suspicion will
                    certainly vary with the circumstances of the case. In the final analysis, the
                    actual determination as to whether the circumstances are suspicious enough so as
                    to shift the burden of adducing affirmative evidence of the testator’s
                    knowledge and approval of the contents of the will to the propounder is largely
                    dependent on the factual matrix of the case itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     One oft-cited example of suspicious
                    circumstances is where a will was prepared by a person who takes a substantial
                    benefit under it, or who has procured its execution, such as by suggesting the
                    terms to the testator or instructing a solicitor to draft the will which is then
                    executed by the testator alone (see John G. Ross Martyn, Stuart Bridge
                    &amp; Mika Oldham, <em>Theobald on Wills</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 16th Ed, 2001) at p 35). In such suspicious circumstances
                    where no presumption arises, the propounder of the will must produce affirmative
                    evidence of the testator’s knowledge and approval. The court will
                    typically look for evidence that the testamentary instrument was read over by,
                    or to, the testator, or evidence that the testator gave instructions for the
                    drafting of the will and that the will was drafted in accordance with those
                    instructions (see <em>Butlin</em> at 483–485). The
                    court may require further evidence if the circumstances so require (see
                        <em>Fulton</em> at 469). Thus, in <em>Mahendran</em> at [26], the Court of Appeal held that evidence that a
                    will was read and explained to a testatrix with the requisite mental capacity
                    gave rise to the “natural and proper inference” that the testatrix
                    understood and approved of the contents of the will before she signed it.
                    Similar evidence was accepted by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in
                        <em>Ip Wai Hung v Yip Man Chiu and others</em> [2007]
                    HKCU 2108 (unreported) to establish that a testator who did not suffer from
                    any mental diseases had knowledge of a will read over to him and had approved
                    it. Returning to the case of <em>Cattermole v Prisk</em>,
                    although there were suspicious circumstances surrounding its execution,
                    Norris J found (at [76]) that the widow knew and approved of the will
                    because she alone gave instructions for it without the aid of notes and spoke
                    about the terms to her banker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Further, where the testator is mentally
                    impaired, the suspicious circumstances are reinforced, and the propounder must
                    also show that the testator was competent to make the will. Accordingly, the
                    irrationality or unusual contents of the will may go towards raising suspicious
                    circumstances. However, the court should not be concerned with the fairness or
                    equity of the will <em>per se</em> if the evidence shows,
                    on a balance of probabilities, that it represented the testator’s
                    intentions. Chadwick LJ warned in <em>Fuller v
                        Strum</em> [2002] 1 WLR 1097 at 1118H–1119B that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...The question is not whether the court approves of the circumstances in
                        which the document was executed or of its contents. The question is whether
                        the court is satisfied that the contents do truly represent the
                        testator’s testamentary intentions. That is not, of course, to suggest
                        that the circumstances of execution or the contents may not, in the
                        particular case, be of the greatest materiality in reaching a conclusion
                        whether or not the testator did know and approve of the contents of the
                        document – and did intend that they should have testamentary effect.
                        But their importance is evidential. There is no overriding requirement of
                        morality....</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With these principles in mind, we turn to the Judge’s decision
                    on the testamentary capacity of Mdm Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Testamentary capacity of Mdm Goh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the totality of the evidence, the Judge
                    preferred the opinions of Caroline’s experts that Mdm Goh did not
                    have testamentary capacity to make the 1996 Will, to the opinion of Dr Tan,
                    even though he had testified that he was able to “conclude with a degree
                    of medical certainty that at the time [Mdm Goh] made her [1996] Will …
                    she possessed testamentary capacity to do so”. Dr Tan had never
                    examined Mdm Goh when she was alive and his opinion was given on the basis
                    of Dr KS Lee’s opinion that Mdm Goh’s CT scan results were
                    normal when they were not. We did not find it necessary to re-examine the
                    medical evidence to determine whether the Judge’s finding was correct. It
                    is an established principle that an appellate court should be slow to disturb
                    the lower court’s findings of fact. Nonetheless, we had some doubts about
                    the correctness of the Judge’s determination of Mdm Goh’s lack
                    of testamentary capacity at the material time based only on the medical evidence
                    adduced by Caroline’s medical experts. We have stressed above that the
                    existence of some medical condition affecting a testator’s mental capacity
                    was not equivalent to a loss of testamentary capacity. The Judge found that
                    Mdm Goh was suffering from dementia or a cognitive impairment (although she
                    made no finding that it was due to or related to Alzheimer’s disease).
                    However, Mdm Goh’s condition clearly varied in severity and
                    fluctuated over time. Dementia is a progressive illness, which might not have
                    affected Mdm Goh’s mental faculties to the extent that she lacked
                    testamentary capacity at an early stage of her illness. She could have had
                    moments of lucidity during which she would have possessed testamentary capacity
                    to execute a will. Indeed, after 1996, she recovered sufficiently to give and
                    revoke powers of attorney concerning her affairs to Muriel and Caroline, and
                    neither of them had challenged these transactions. These events showed that she
                    (like the testatrix in <em>Cattermole v Prisk</em> who had
                    moments of lucidity) might well have been lucid on 21 August
                1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Judge had placed great weight on the
                    evidence of the medical doctors who had personally treated Mdm Goh. However, we
                    did not think that these medical opinions were sufficient to show that Mdm Goh
                    did not have testamentary capacity at the material time. First, the opinions
                    were based on clinical notes and tests conducted either before or after
                    21 August 1996; there were no contemporaneous clinical observations. The
                    clinical notes nearest in time were made by Prof KO Lee, who had briefly
                    examined Mdm Goh on 19 August 1996, but these notes consisted mainly
                    of a record of Mdm Goh’s recent fall and the CT scan. Second, the
                    opinions of Prof Kua and Dr Ong were also of limited assistance for
                    the same reason. Third, such retrospective opinions would be of great assistance
                    to the court if Mdm Goh had a history of being unable to understand what
                    was communicated to her, but that was not the case here. In short, none of these
                    doctors had made a contemporaneous diagnosis that Mdm Goh’s medical
                    condition would have incapacitated her testamentary competence at the making of
                    the 1996 Will. We accepted that they were not asked this question. But based on
                    the evidence before the court, we were unable to draw the conclusion that
                    because Mdm Goh was suffering from dementia (which caused her to be
                    forgetful) she did not have testamentary capacity at the material
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, even though the medical evidence
                    adduced by Caroline was not sufficient to prove that Mdm Goh lacked
                    testamentary capacity, this did not mean that she had such capacity. Muriel, as
                    the propounder of the 1996 Will, had the burden of showing that Mdm Goh
                        <em>had</em> testamentary capacity at the material time
                    and the medical evidence adduced by her was even weaker than the medical
                    evidence provided by Caroline’s witnesses. To discharge that burden,
                    Muriel had to adduce other non-medical evidence to show what the medical
                    evidence did not show. While Muriel did adduce other contemporaneous evidence in
                    the form of eyewitness testimonies of what had happened during the signing of
                    the 1996 Will to try to show that Mdm Goh had testamentary capacity, this
                    evidence was rejected by the Judge. We found no reason to depart from the
                    Judge’s conclusion that Muriel had not discharged her burden of
                    proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did Mdm Goh understand and approve the contents of the 1996
                Will?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We turn now to consider the more important
                    element of whether Mdm Goh had understood and approved of the contents of
                    the 1996 Will. We accepted the Judge’s findings that the circumstances
                    surrounding the drafting and execution of the 1996 Will, coupled with its
                    contents, were highly suspicious. Muriel’s pleaded case that Mdm Goh
                    had given instructions to MO on the preparation and drafting of the 1996 Will
                    was not supported by MO’s testimony. It was clear from the evidence that
                    it was Muriel and not Mdm Goh who instructed MO on the terms of the 1996
                    Will, and that MO had prepared it without having spoken to Mdm Goh on its
                    contents. The 1996 Will was the product of <em>their discussion
                        on the terms</em>, and not Mdm Goh’s intentions as Muriel
                    had claimed. The provisions of the 1996 Will reflected Muriel’s earlier
                    suggestions that Mdm Goh’s assets should be distributed fairly among
                    the children and not left to Caroline alone, contrary to Mdm Goh’s
                    intention that Caroline was to inherit the bulk of her estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Nonetheless, the pivotal role played by Muriel
                    in the preparation of the 1996 Will or the fact that the 1996 Will contained
                    unusual terms would not in themselves, invalidate it if it could be shown that
                    Mdm Goh had in fact understood and approved its contents. Ultimately,
                    Mdm Goh was free to accept and approve of Muriel’s proposals on how
                    her estate should be distributed. The critical question was whether Mdm Goh
                    understood and approved those proposals. In our view, this was where Muriel also
                    failed to discharge the burden on her to prove this element.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The evidence required to establish that
                    Mdm Goh knew and approved the contents of the 1996 Will necessarily
                    depended on what steps were taken to ensure that she was apprised of its
                    contents and the circumstances under which the 1996 Will was signed.
                    Counsel for Muriel was correct in arguing that the Judge’s finding that
                    Mdm Goh suffered from early stage dementia, in itself, did not determine the
                    issue of testamentary capacity, but that her mental infirmity was obviously
                    germane to her comprehension of the 1996 Will at the time she signed it. In
                        <em>Cattermole v Prisk</em>, the court expressed (at
                    [76]) that it was impressed by the fact that the testatrix, who, like Mdm Goh,
                    was likely to be suffering from early stage dementia, had personally given
                    instructions for the drafting of the will and had discussed its terms with her
                    banker. Whereas the reading of a will to a testator suffering from some degree
                    of mental incapacity might allow a facade or even a <em>prima
                        facie</em> impression of testamentary understanding, any doubt arising
                    from the circumstances surrounding its execution would likely be dispelled where
                    it is shown that the testator gave the instructions and discussed the terms of a
                    will with the drafter. Muriel’s assertions that Mdm Goh had given
                    such instructions and MO’s inability to confirm them meant that she had to
                    adduce other evidence to establish that Mdm Goh had the requisite knowledge
                    and had approved of its contents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In this respect, our view of the evidence
                    adduced by Muriel was that it was thin to the extent of invisibility. Counsel
                    for Muriel relied extensively on MO’s testimony that she had read the 1996
                    Will line by line to Mdm Goh who had nodded in agreement, and that the
                    other witnesses had not recalled anything amiss with the execution generally. As
                    mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), under ordinary
                    circumstances the reading of a will to a testator not suffering from any mental
                    infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the
                    contents, but that general principle would not apply to a situation where the
                    testator might not have full understanding due to the onset of dementia. In this
                    case, Dr Ong had cautioned that given her mental state, Mdm Goh could
                    have <em>appeared</em> to understand the contents of the
                    1996 Will when it was read to her, but this did not necessarily indicate actual
                    understanding. The Judge accepted Dr Ong’s caution in this respect,
                    and there was no reason for us to disagree with that finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     But the Judge also considered the evidence of
                    Muriel’s witnesses that Mdm Goh had understood the contents of the
                    1996 Will before signing. She rejected the evidence as highly unsatisfactory. We
                    agreed with the Judge on her findings, particularly with respect to MO’s
                    testimony. MO’s testimony was critical. She was the best person to give a
                    complete account of what had happened in relation to the preparation and the
                    signing of the 1996 Will. However, MO’s testimony was difficult to
                    believe. She did not take any attendance notes about her meeting with
                    Mdm Goh on the two occasions concerned (and for which no explanation was
                    offered). She could not recall the conversation she had with Muriel as recorded
                    in the Second Fax which was sent on the morning of 21 August 1996, scant
                    hours before Mdm Goh signed the 1996 Will. All these failures in
                    recollection of critical events surrounding the execution of the 1996 Will
                    suggested that Mdm Goh had merely signed what was placed in front of her.
                    Furthermore, she admitted that she did not explain the terms of the
                    1996 Will to Mdm Goh. Consequently, the Judge found that her evidence
                    on Mdm Goh’s competency in understanding the terms of the 1996 Will
                    lacked credibility. W’s testimony was equally unsatisfactory. W had merely
                    said that it was also her practice to read a will line by line to a testator.
                    Dr Goh’s evidence also lacked credibility. He claimed to have seen
                    Mdm Goh initial every page of the 1996 Will, but this claim was
                    untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Accordingly, we agreed with the Judge’s
                    finding that Muriel had failed to prove that Mdm Goh had understood the
                    terms of the 1996 Will before she signed it. The evidence did not show that it
                    had been properly, if at all, explained to her. Reading a will line by line to a
                    testator is not conclusive evidence that the testator understood each line,
                    especially when she, as was the case with Mdm Goh, suffered from some
                    degree of mental infirmity. In the present case, it should be borne in mind that
                    the 1996 Will was no ordinary will. Its provisions were quite unusual, if not
                    extraordinary for a will. The material provisions may be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     Caroline and Paul were recorded to
                        have bought a half-share of the Holland Road House at a “discounted
                        price of $2.5 million in 1995”. They were given the option to
                        purchase, within one year of Mdm Goh’s death, her half-share of
                        the Holland Road House at the prevailing market price as determined by two
                        independent valuers of international repute. If the option was not
                        exercised, the Holland Road House was to be sold “in the
                        market”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     Paul was to fully indemnify Mdm Goh’s estate for any liability
                        incurred in the mortgage executed jointly between Caroline, Paul and
                        Mdm Goh for the purchase of the Holland Road House. He was further
                        expected to pay off the amount of the purchase loan from his own
                        funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        residuary estate was to be held on trust for Alexander, Maureen, Ping Kong,
                        Ping Swee and Muriel in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It can be seen that the 1996 Will read more
                    like an exercise in justifying a settlement of past unequal treatment or an
                    equalisation of inheritance, rather than just the making of a will that a normal
                    testator would normally do. The provisions certainly had the imprint of Muriel
                    who had proposed such an arrangement to Alexander in the 25 June 1994
                    letter when Mdm Goh was still alive. Given her mental infirmity at the
                    material time, we had serious doubts about Mdm Goh’s capacity to
                    understand the complex provisions in the 1996 Will, even if it had been read to
                    her line by line, especially when, as admitted by MO, no explanation on what the
                    lines meant was given to Mdm Goh. In the circumstances, we had no
                    difficulty in agreeing with the Judge that Muriel had failed to prove on a
                    balance of probabilities that Mdm Goh had understood the contents of the
                    1996 Will before she signed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In our view, this case demonstrates that
                    solicitors who undertake the task of preparing wills and/or witnessing the
                    execution of wills must take the necessary precautions or steps in order to
                    fulfil their duties to their clients. The precautions are not complicated nor
                    are they time consuming. In any case, as solicitors, they must do what is
                    required, however complicated or difficult the task may be. The central task is
                    to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes of the testator. How
                    this is done depends on the circumstances of each case. In every case, the
                    solicitor should be cautious about taking instructions from any person who is to
                    be named as a beneficiary in the will. If a testator is known to be suffering
                    from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental
                    capacity before she is allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator
                    fully understands the will. In the case of a person with mental infirmities like
                    Mdm Goh, it should have included attending on Mdm Goh personally to
                    take instructions from her, providing her with and explaining a draft of the
                    will to her, and if there is any doubt as to her mental capacity, to advise that
                    a psychiatrist (or some other qualified medical practitioner) attend on her to
                    assess her mental capacity. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the
                    appropriate questions to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand
                    the contents of the will. The testator should be asked as simple a question as
                    whether he or she is making a will for the first time or whether he or she had
                    made a will previously. In the latter case, the solicitor should ask whether the
                    testator knows that he or she is revoking the existing will. These questions may
                    be formulaic, but they are necessary to avoid cases such as this. Finally, as a
                    matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the
                    solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on
                    the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had
                    transpired during the meeting or meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We would also reiterate the observations made
                    recently in <em>Low Ah Cheow and others v Ng Hock Guan</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    The preparation of a will involves serious
                            professional responsibilities, which solicitors must uncompromisingly
                            observe and discharge. Regrettably, it seems to us that, all too often
                            nowadays, solicitors appear to consider the preparation of a will to be
                            no more than a routine exercise in form filling. This is <em>wrong</em>. Before preparing a will, the solicitor
                            concerned ought to have a thorough discussion with the testator on all
                            the possible legal issues and potential complications that might arise
                            in the implementation of the terms of the will. The solicitor ought to
                            painstakingly and accurately document his discussions with and his
                            instructions from the testator. He should also confirm with the
                            testator, prior to the execution of the will, that the contents of the
                            will as drafted accurately express the latter’s intention. A
                            translation, if required, must be thoroughly and competently done. Half
                            measures or the cutting of corners in the discharge of these serious
                            professional responsibilities will not do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    In our view, the solicitor concerned should also
                            conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential
                            conflict of interest may appear to exist. If the solicitor might be
                            perceived as anything less than a completely independent adviser to the
                            testator, he ought not, as a matter of good practice, to be involved in
                            the explanation, the interpretation and the execution of the will. In
                            particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the
                            solicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past dealings
                            with the sole beneficiary under a will, and all the more so if the will
                            has been prepared urgently and executed in unusual circumstances with
                            that sole beneficiary’s active involvement. When such a case
                            occurs, the solicitor involved must be prepared to have his conduct
                            microscopically scrutinised and, perhaps, even his motives called into
                            question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     With Singapore’s aging population and
                    the increased life expectancy of Singaporeans, aged members of our community not
                    infrequently experience resultant loss in memory or mental capacity. In these
                    circumstances, it is desirable that members of the legal profession play a part
                    in reducing the opportunities for litigation over testamentary dispositions by
                    testators who are suffering from dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and the
                    whole range of mental illnesses that are associated with old age. If solicitors
                    do their part, it will reduce, if not eliminate, all the borderline cases where
                    doctors are asked to give their best opinions on the mental condition of someone
                    they might not even have attended to, based on medical records which often are
                    not helpful for the purpose at hand. When psychiatrists err, judges will also
                    err if they rely on their evidence. The judicial process is not the best
                    mechanism to determine the testamentary capacity of a testator, and solicitors
                    who draw up wills bear a special responsibility to the testator and the
                    legitimate beneficiaries not to have their handiwork picked over by
                    psychiatrists acting on imperfect information in a court of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the present case, we express no opinion on
                    the motive of Muriel in getting Mdm Goh to sign the 1996 Will in the manner
                    in which it was done. We can understand what she did and why she did what she
                    thought was right for the other members of the family, but there is a legal way
                    to do such things, and she went about it the wrong way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     For the reasons above, we dismissed the appeal
                    with costs of the appeal to be borne by the appellant. We did not, however, find
                    it necessary to disturb the Judge’s order of costs for the trial below or
                    to order costs to the interveners.</p>
