the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There
are very few legal provisions in the Singapore legal landscape which,
although simply stated (and intuitively attractive), are very difficult to
apply in practice. Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic
of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Singapore Constitution”)
is one of these rare exceptions. In particular, Article 12(1) of
the Singapore Constitution (“Art 12(1)”), which is one of the provisions
in issue in the present appeals (<em>viz</em>,
Civil Appeal No 54 of 2013 (“CA 54/2013”) and Civil Appeal No 125
of 2013 (“CA 125/2013”)), is deceptively simple in its economy of
language:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Equal
protection</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>12.</b>—(1) All persons are equal
before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
issue before this court in the present appeals can be stated very simply:
is s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the current Penal
Code”) inconsistent with Art 9 and/or Art 12 of the Singapore Constitution
(referred to hereafter as “Art 9” and “Art 12”, respectively), and
hence, unconstitutional to the extent of such inconsistency? In
this regard, Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution (“Art 9(1)”),
which is the specific provision in Art 9 that the appellants in
CA 54/2013 and the appellant in CA 125/2013 (collectively, “the
Appellants”) are relying on, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Liberty
of the person</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9.</b>—(1) No person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with
law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Art 4 of the Singapore Constitution (“Art 4”), which is set
out below, should also be noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Supremacy
of Constitution</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>4</b>.    This
Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any
law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution
which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of
the inconsistency, be void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 377A
of the current Penal Code, the provision which is the subject of
the Appellants’ constitutional challenge, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Outrages on
decency</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>377A</b>.    Any
male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission
of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male
person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person,
shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend
to 2 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this judgment, we shall be referring to s 377A of not only
the current Penal Code, but also earlier editions of that statute.
As there are no substantial differences between the various versions
of s 377A, we shall use the generic term “s 377A” to denote the
version of s 377A in force at the particular point in time being
discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       We
also note that there is a presumption of constitutionality inasmuch
as a court will not lightly find a statute or any provision(s) thereof (referred
to hereafter as a “statute” for short) unconstitutional (see, for example,
the decision of this court in <em>Public Prosecutor
v Taw Cheng Kong</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 (“<em>Taw
Cheng Kong (CA)</em>”) at [60]). This is only logical as well
as commonsensical as our legislature is presumed not to enact legislation
which is inconsistent with the Singapore Constitution. However, an
issue arises in these appeals as to whether or not this presumption applies
to <em>colonial</em> legislation as well,
given that s 377A was first introduced into our Penal Code in 1938,
when Singapore was still a British colony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Whilst
the central issue in the present appeals (as set out above at [2]) can
be stated simply, it is intensely controversial, and has elicited diametrically
opposed (as well as, on occasion at least, intense and even emotional)
responses in the extra-legal sphere, especially where Art 12 is concerned.
A great many arguments have been mounted by proponents on each side
of the divide. It is no exaggeration to say that this court found itself
in the midst of a cacophony of voices. Be that as it may, only one
voice – and one voice alone – is relevant in so far as the present
appeals are concerned: it is the voice of the law, which represents
the voice of objectivity. All other voices are irrelevant; indeed,
they generate unnecessary heat (and distraction) rather than needful
(and illuminating) light.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Important general points</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Only legal arguments are relevant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Before
we set out the background facts and procedural history of the present
appeals, it is necessary for us to first highlight a few important general
points. The first is that many of the difficulties encountered in
the context of Art 9 and Art 12 relate to the fact that the court
is often involved in a delicate balancing process. More importantly,
it often faces a paradox which it must nevertheless negotiate. On
the one hand, it must disregard extra-legal considerations that
are uniquely within the purview of the legislature (here, the Singapore
Parliament). This was in fact a central motif in the justly famous
theory of adjudication proffered by the late Prof Ronald Dworkin
(in an entire series of works, commencing with his seminal book, <em>Taking Rights Seriously</em> (Harvard University
Press, 1978) (especially at ch 4)). Yet, where the constitutionality
of a statute is challenged under Art 9 and/or Art 12, the court
must have regard to extra-legal considerations <em>in
so far as they impact the application of</em> Art 9 and Art 12
themselves. The vexing difficulty – particularly in the context
of the present appeals – is to discern where the line is to be drawn,
bearing in mind that where the court does indeed have regard to
extra-legal considerations, this must (in the nature of things)
be by way of <em>a very limited brief premised
only on</em> what is <em>absolutely necessary</em> to
enable the court to <em>apply</em> the relevant <em>legal</em> principles <em>relating
to Art 9 and Art 12</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Drawing
such <em>a line in the legal sand</em> is
imperative. If this is not done, the court will necessarily be sucked
into and thereby descend into the <em>political</em> arena,
which would in turn undermine (or even destroy) the very role which
constitutes the <em>raison d’être</em> for
the court’s existence in the first place – namely, to furnish an <em>independent, neutral and </em><em>objective</em> forum
for deciding, on the basis of objective legal rules and principles,
(<em>inter alia</em>) what rights parties
have in a given situation. That the court’s role as a neutral arbiter
is utterly vital is underscored in a situation where (as is the case
here) the arguments on either side of what is in substance a <em>legislative</em> divide are intensely controversial
and the relevant empirical evidence is ambiguous at best. All that
the court can – and must – be concerned with in these circumstances
is whether any <em>fundamental rights</em> under <em>the Singapore Constitution</em> (such as those
pursuant to Art 9 and Art 12) have indeed been violated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
determining the constitutionality of a statute which is alleged
to be inconsistent with Art 12 (or, for that matter, any other Article
of the Singapore Constitution), the court’s main concern is to be
careful not to trespass into extra-legal territory which legitimately
belongs only to the legislature. Looked at in this light, the many
extra-legal arguments on the constitutionality of s 377A are <em>irrelevant</em> to the court’s application
of Art 12. We hasten to add that this does <em>not</em> mean
that these arguments are <em>wholly</em> irrelevant
in <em>all</em> contexts. They are appropriate
to a <em>legislative</em> debate, but that
is wholly beyond the remit of the court. The proponents of these arguments
fail to see this because they overlook the vital distinction referred
to above (at [6]) between legal principles and extra-legal considerations.
Hence, they proffer various extra-legal arguments as though those
arguments are central to the court’s task, when they serve only
to muddy an already difficult legal path which the court is attempting
its level best to negotiate. This is unfortunate, to say the least.
Indeed, the difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that some of
the extra-legal arguments might also have an overlay of emotional
and/or other overtones, and, on this ground alone, are more suited
(if at all) to a <em>legislative</em> (or
even <em>philosophical</em>) – but <em>not</em> a <em>legal</em> –
debate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What is legally relevant (and
irrelevant) in the context of the present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It
follows, <em>a fortiori</em>, from the observations
in the preceding paragraph that in deciding the present appeals,
this court cannot – and must not – be drawn into the sphere of even
broader (and, arguably, even more speculative) debate, in particular,
on the possible legal as well as extra-legal <em>consequences</em> flowing
from its decision on the constitutionality of s 377A. Indeed, counsel
for the appellants in CA 54/2013, Ms Deborah Barker SC (“Ms Barker”),
was at pains to point out right at the outset of her clients’ written
case (as well as in her oral submissions before this court) that
her clients’ appeal is <em>not</em> about <em>other </em><em>legal</em> rights
(such as the right to same-sex marriage). There is, in fact, <em>no necessary connection</em> between any court decision
on the constitutionality of s 377A and any <em>positive</em> rights,
the grant (or otherwise) of which is clearly a matter for <em>the legislature – and the legislature alone</em>.
The line referred to above between what is legitimately within the
purview of the court and what is legitimately within the purview of
the legislature applies, as noted at the outset of the present paragraph,
in an <em>a fortiori</em> manner in the present
appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It
follows that in the present appeals, this court will take into account <em>only</em> those arguments which are <em>legally</em> relevant to the application of
Art 9 and Art 12. All other arguments – interesting though they
might be – ought to be canvassed in the <em>appropriate</em> fora
(whether of a legislative, academic or some other public (but non-judicial)
nature).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It
is also important to emphasise that it follows that nothing in this judgment
impacts the freedom of a person or group of persons to <em>freely</em> espouse as well as practise his/its
values <em>within the boundaries of the law</em> (such
as, in the religious context, within the boundaries laid down by
Art 15 of the Singapore Constitution and the Maintenance of Religious
Harmony Act (Cap 167A, 2001 Rev Ed)). This is consistent with the
multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual as well as multi-religious
nature of Singapore society. This is not mere political rhetoric,
but a real and practical framework that furnishes real and practical
freedom for each group and each individual to practise its/his values
– <em>provided (it is important to reiterate) this
is done within the parameters and boundaries laid down by the existing
law of the land.</em> This freedom <em>cannot</em>,
however, extend to an insistence by a particular group or individual
that its/his values be <em>imposed</em> on <em>other</em> groups or other individuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Given
our approach of focusing only on the relevant <em>legal</em> arguments in
the present appeals, might it be argued that this court is conducting
itself like an ostrich whose head is buried in the sand inasmuch
as it might be ignoring the need to achieve a <em>substantively
fair</em> result in the two cases at hand? This is, at first
blush, a rather powerful argument. However, there seems to us no
reason why a <em>substantively fair</em> result
cannot be arrived at by focusing only on the relevant <em>legal</em> arguments. Indeed (and on the <em>contrary</em>), <em>were</em> this
court to <em>also</em> consider <em>extra</em>-legal arguments that are <em>within the purview of the Singapore Parliament</em>,
would <em>that</em> not be <em>contrary</em> to <em>fairness</em> in both a procedural <em>as well as</em> a substantive sense? It should
also be noted that <em>if it is thought that a
substantively fair result can only be achieved by a consideration
of extra-legal arguments as well, then the Singapore Parliament
can always remedy the situation in the appropriate fashion. However,
it would then be doing so in a legitimate manner. It bears repeating
that this court cannot seek to achieve the same result as it does
not have the legitimate jurisdiction to do so – the legitimate jurisdiction
lies, instead, with the Singapore Parliament.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts and procedural
history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As
we have already mentioned, the present appeals pertain to the constitutionality
of s 377A. The Appellants are essentially arguing that s 377A violates
Art 9 and/or Art 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
appellant in CA 125/2013, Tan Eng Hong (“Tan”), was arrested on
9 March 2010 for engaging in oral sex with a male partner in the
cubicle of a public toilet. Tan and the male partner were charged
under s 377A on 2 September 2010 and 1 September 2010 respectively.
Tan filed an application (by way of an originating summons (“OS”))
to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A on 24 September 2010.
On 15 October 2010, the Prosecution substituted the s 377A charges
against Tan and his partner with charges under s 294(<em>a</em>) of the current Penal Code for the commission of
an obscene act in a public place. Tan and the Attorney-General,
the respondent in the present appeals (“the Respondent”), proceeded
to litigate over the issue of whether Tan had the requisite <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the constitutionality
of s 377A. That culminated in the decision of this court in <em>Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General</em> [2012]
4 SLR 476 (“<em>Tan Eng Hong (standing)</em>”),
delivered on 21 August 2012, where it was held that Tan did have
the requisite <em>locus standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
appellants in CA 54/2013, Lim Meng Suang (“Lim”) and Kenneth Chee
Mun-Leon (“Chee”), have been in a romantic and sexual relationship for
the past 15 years. Together, they run “TheBearProject”, an informal social
group for plus-sized gay men. Both men aver that they have been sexually
attracted to men since young, and have experienced various forms of
social discrimination against homosexual men. On 30 November 2012, slightly
over three months after the judgment in <em>Tan
Eng Hong (standing)</em> was delivered, Lim and Chee filed
an OS to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Tan’s
substantive application was first heard by a High Court judge on
18 January 2013. Lim and Chee’s substantive application was first
heard by the same High Court judge (“the Judge”) on 7 February 2013.
Judgments for these two substantive applications were released on,
respectively, 2 October 2013 (reported as <em>Tan
Eng Hong v Attorney-General</em> [2013] 4 SLR 1059 (“<em>Tan Eng Hong (substantive)</em>”)) and 9 April
2013 (reported as <em>Lim Meng Suang and another
v Attorney-General</em> [2013] 3 SLR 118 (“<em>Lim Meng
Suang</em>”)). In both judgments, the Judge held that s 377A
did not violate the Singapore Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lim
and Chee filed their notice of appeal on 30 April 2013. On 15 July 2013,
Lim and Chee sought, <em>inter alia</em>,
leave to amend their OS to include new arguments centring on how
s 377A violated Art 9. Their application was dismissed by a High
Court judge sitting as a single judge of the Court of Appeal. Lim
and Chee then filed Summons No 3664 of 2013 (“SUM 3664/2013”) on
17 July 2013, requesting a three-judge Court of Appeal to review
that judge’s dismissal of their application. SUM 3664/2013 was heard
on 2 August 2013, whereupon it was adjourned to be heard together
with Lim and Chee’s substantive appeal (<em>ie</em>,
CA 54/2013). CA 54/2013 was set down to be heard on 14 October 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In
the meantime, Tan filed an application on 14 August 2013 for leave to
intervene in CA 54/2013. This application for leave to intervene
was subsequently withdrawn when it was heard on 5 September 2013.
As mentioned above at [16], the judgment for Tan’s substantive application was
released on 2 October 2013. A notice of appeal (assigned the number “CA 125/2013”)
was quickly filed on 8 October 2013, along with an application for, <em>inter alia</em>, CA 125/2013 to be expedited
and heard together with CA 54/2013 on 14 October 2013. That application
was heard on 10 October 2013, wherein this court ordered CA 54/2013
and CA 125/2013 to be heard together because they raised essentially
the same issues of law. The hearing for CA 54/2013, originally scheduled
for 14 October 2013, was vacated to allow counsel for Tan, Mr M Ravi
(“Mr Ravi”), to file submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the arguments in
the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Ms Barker’s
arguments in the court below centred on how s 377A violated Art 12.
Firstly, it was submitted that equal protection under Art 12 extended
to protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Secondly, it was said that s 377A was so absurd, arbitrary and unreasonable
that it could not be good law. Thirdly, it was argued that s 377A
failed the two-step test for determining the constitutionality of
a statute under Art 12 (“the ‘reasonable classification’ test”)
because it disclosed no intelligible differentia and the differentia
applied bore no rational relation to the object of s 377A. (Under
the “reasonable classification” test, which was enunciated in, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Taw Cheng
Kong (CA)</em>, <em>Nguyen Tuong Van v Public
Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 (“<em>Nguyen Tuong
Van</em>”) and <em>Yong Vui Kong v Public
Prosecutor and another matter</em> [2010] 3 SLR 489 (“<em>Yong Vui Kong</em>”), a statute that prescribes
a differentiating measure will nonetheless be consistent with Art 12
if it is based on “reasonable classification”; <em>ie</em>,
if: (a) the classification prescribed by the statute is founded
on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons within
the defined group from persons outside the group; and (b) that differentia
has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the
statute.) Lastly, Ms Barker submitted that s 377A did not conform
to trends in international jurisprudence, which militated against discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation. She therefore prayed for s 377A
to be struck down in <em>toto</em> (<em>cf</em> the prayers sought by Lim and Chee
on appeal at para 347 <em>et seq</em> of
their Appellants’ Case, in which it is argued, as an alternative,
that s 377A should be read down by striking out the words “or private”
therein).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Ravi’s
arguments in the court below centred on how s 377A was inconsistent
with both Art 9 and Art 12. He argued that s 377A was contrary to
the fundamental rules of natural justice and was therefore not “law”
for the purposes of Art 9(1). In relation to Art 12, he contended
that s 377A was absurd, arbitrary and unreasonable, and that the
differentia of males bore no rational relation to the object of
the provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Respondent essentially argued that s 377A passed the “reasonable classification”
test. The objectives of s 377A, it submitted, comprised the preservation
of public morality and the safeguarding of public health (it should
be noted that this last-mentioned point was not pursued before this court).
The non-inclusion of female homosexual conduct did not render s 377A
under-inclusive because such conduct was either less prevalent or perceived
to be less repugnant than male homosexual conduct. Even if s 377A
were under-inclusive, the Respondent contended, legislative leeway ought
to be given to our Parliament. Most importantly, it was submitted, there
should be a strong presumption of constitutionality for laws passed
by the legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decisions below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in Lim Meng Suang</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The

a historical inquiry into Art 12. Article 12 was found to be consanguine
with equivalent provisions in the US Constitution, the Constitution
of India and the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. Equal protection,
the Judge held, was a guarantee of not merely procedural or administrative
equality, but also substantive equality. Nevertheless, legislatures
around the world had had to continually classify diverse groups and
activities for different purposes; a legislature was entitled to
pass laws that dealt with the problems stemming from the inherent
inequality and differences pervasive in society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Judge proceeded to apply the “reasonable classification” test to s 377A.
It was clear, he held, that the classification prescribed by s 377A
was based on an intelligible differentia: there was little difficulty
in determining who fell within and without the provision. The second-stage
inquiry into whether the differentia was rationally related to the
object of s 377A was, however, fraught with difficulty. Determining
the purpose of legislation was not straightforward, and there were
also problems with the extent of over- or under-classification required
before the court could find that a rational relation was absent.
In addition, there was a danger of engaging in tautological reasoning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
Judge was of the view that the purpose of s 377A was to be determined
at the time it was first introduced into Singapore’s Penal Code in
1938. That purpose, he found, had remained unchanged to the present day:
“[t]he act of males engaging in grossly indecent acts with other
males was to be criminalised” (see <em>Lim Meng
Suang</em> at [67]). There was thus a “complete coincidence”
(see <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at [100]) between
the differentia in relation to the classification prescribed by
s 377A and the object of that provision; the “reasonable classification”
test was clearly satisfied. Turning to the issue of legitimacy of
purpose, the Judge held that the purpose of s 377A was legitimate
because of the weight of historical practice and “deep seated feelings”
pertaining to procreation and family lineage (see <em>Lim
Meng Suang</em> at [127]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in Tan Eng Hong
(substantive)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
Judge commenced his judgment in <em>Tan Eng Hong
(substantive)</em> with an examination of Art 9(1), and held
that the reference to “law” therein had to include a reference to
the fundamental rules of natural justice. He observed that there
was a dearth of jurisprudence on the concept and scope of those
rules. Nevertheless, he noted two possible types of legislation
that would not qualify as “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1), namely:
(a) legislation aimed at securing the conviction of particular individuals;
and (b) legislation that was absurd or arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     After
considering statements from pro- as well as anti-homosexual groups,
medical and scientific bodies and court decisions, the Judge declined
to find that homosexuality was a natural and immutable attribute. This
rendered moot the argument that s 377A was an absurd law which was contrary
to the fundamental rules of natural justice because it targeted
a natural and immutable attribute of a person. The Judge was also
not persuaded that s 377A was unconstitutional because it was too
vague and uncertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
so far as the constitutional challenge under Art 12 was concerned, the
Judge held that the “reasonable classification” test applied to
all constitutional challenges based on this Article. He did not
adopt the approach taken in the foreign authorities cited to him
because those authorities factored in legal and extra-legal social,
economic, cultural and political considerations which were unique
to their respective jurisdictions. The Judge also observed that
s 377A could not be said to have an unsound purpose merely because
that purpose was to advance a certain allegedly controversial morality.
Finally, the Judge ruled that there was a complete coincidence between
the differentia embodied in s 377A (<em>viz</em>,
male homosexuals or bisexual males who engage in acts of gross indecency
with another male within the meaning of the provision) and the purpose
and object of the provision (<em>viz</em>,
making male homosexual conduct an offence because such conduct was
not desirable).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ respective cases
on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 54/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before
this court, Ms Barker submitted (in relation to CA 54/2013) that
Lim and Chee possessed the requisite <em>locus
standi</em> to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A for
the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Tan Eng Hong (standing)</em> made it clear
that where a person who was a member of the group defined by a purportedly
unconstitutional statute (referred to hereafter as an “impugned
statute” where appropriate to the context) faced a real and credible
threat of prosecution under that statute, this was sufficient to
give him <em>locus standi</em> to challenge
the constitutionality of that statute under Art 12. Lim and Chee
were both sexually active male homosexuals falling within the group
defined by s 377A. They thus had the <em>locus
standi</em> to challenge s 377A as being violative of Art 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     With
regard to Art 9, given Lim and Chee’s averment that their personal
rights under that Article had been violated and that there was a
real controversy between the parties, this sufficed to establish their <em>locus standi</em> to challenge the constitutionality
of s 377A under that Article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In
terms of the substantive merits of CA 54/2013, Ms Barker argued that
s 377A violated Art 12(1). Section 377A was said to be arbitrary
on its face as: (a) it ran foul of the concept of constitutional
supremacy wherein a State could not deprive minorities of their
fundamental liberties simply because of popular moral sentiment;
and (b) it criminalised acts that were legal for non-male homosexuals.
Section 377A, it was contended, also failed the “reasonable classification”
test as the classification prescribed by that provision was not
based on an intelligible differentia; and even if the classification
could be said to be based on an intelligible differentia, that differentia
bore no rational relation to the object of s 377A. Section 377A,
it was further submitted, also violated Art 12(2) of the Singapore
Constitution (“Art 12(2)”) because sexual orientation was a practically
immutable aspect of a person’s identity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In
relation to Art 9, Ms Barker argued that s 377A violated Art 9(1). The
right to life and personal liberty set out in Art 9(1), she submitted, should
be given a purposive interpretation to include a limited right of privacy.
Life and personal liberty must, at their core, include a right of personal
autonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection and love
towards another human being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
Respondent, on its part, originally submitted that Lim and Chee lacked
the requisite <em>locus standi</em> to challenge
the constitutionality of s 377A. In particular, it argued that a
real controversy was required to establish standing and jurisdiction,
and that such a controversy would only arise when the State took
action pursuant to the impugned statute in question. However, in
a subsequent letter to Ms Barker dated 1 July 2014, the Respondent
stated that it would not be pursuing its case on this particular point
as it had not been raised before the Judge in the proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In
so far as the substantive issues in CA 54/2013 were concerned, the Respondent
argued that s 377A did not violate Art 12(2). Article 12(2), the Respondent
submitted, was exhaustive in terms of the prohibited grounds of
discrimination set out therein, and was distinguishable from constitutional
provisions in other jurisdictions which explicitly enumerated sex
or sexual orientation as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination.
It was further argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Section 377A
did not violate Art 12(1). A single standard of review should be
applied to determine the constitutionality of an impugned statute
under Art 12(1), namely, the “reasonable classification” test. Applying
that test, the classification prescribed by s 377A was founded on
an intelligible differentia which bore a rational relation to the
legislative purpose of the provision. The “reasonable classification”
test did not, and ought not to, require substantive judicial review
of the legislative purpose of s 377A. In any case, the purpose of
s 377A was constitutionally permissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Section 377A
also did not violate Art 9(1). In this regard, comparative jurisprudence
was inapplicable. Reading Art 9(1) to entail a right to privacy
was contrary to the weight of authority, as well as the history,
text and structure of Art 9. In any case, s 377A was “law” for the
purposes of Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 125/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In
CA 125/2013, Mr Ravi made four arguments in relation to Art 12. First,
he submitted that the applicable test for determining the constitutionality
of an impugned statute under Art 12 was not confined to the “reasonable
classification” test. Secondly, he contended that the classification
prescribed by s 377A was not based on an intelligible differentia
because s 377A was vague and “[did] not apply differentia based on
either gender, sexual orientation or [the] nature of [the] sexual
act”. Thirdly, the object of s 377A was, according to Mr Ravi, an
expression of animus by the majority against a minority, and was
therefore incompatible with the constitutional guarantee of individual
fundamental freedoms against majoritarian oppression. Fourthly,
it was argued that there was no rational relation between the purpose
of s 377A and the differentia embodied in that section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In
relation to Art 9, Mr Ravi argued that s 377A was inconsistent with that
Article for three reasons. First, s 377A was impermissibly vague
in the scope of the activity which it purported to prohibit, thereby
creating not only doubt as to its effect, but also a substantial
risk of perversity or arbitrariness in its application. Secondly,
s 377A was arbitrary inasmuch as the criminal penalty which it imposed
served no rational purpose in theory or in practice. Thirdly, s 377A
was absurd in that it criminalised, without any logically defensible
reason, a minority of citizens on the grounds of a core aspect of
their identity which was either unchangeable or suppressible only
at a great personal cost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In
response to Mr Ravi’s submissions, the Respondent made the following
arguments with regard to Art 12. First, the established test for determining
the constitutionality of an impugned statute under Art 12(1) only
required the classification prescribed by the impugned statute to
be founded on an intelligible differentia which bore a rational
relation to the purpose and object of the statute. Secondly, the
relevant classification in relation to s 377A was based on an intelligible
differentia (<em>viz</em>, male homosexuals
or bisexual males who engage in acts of gross indecency with another
male within the meaning of the provision), and that differentia
was rationally related to the purpose and object of the provision
(<em>viz</em>, making male homosexual conduct
an offence because such conduct was not desirable). Thirdly, Art 12(1)
did not contemplate judicial scrutiny of the legislative purpose
of an impugned statute. Fourthly, Art 12(1) “[did] not impose any
blanket prohibition on classifications based on sex or sexual orientation
or ‘immutable’ characteristics, or on classifications that [were] ‘unreasonable’
or ‘impermissible’” [emphasis in original omitted].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
Respondent’s submissions in relation to Art 9 were as follows. First,
Art 9(1) referred to “the deprivation of life in the sense of the
death penalty, and personal liberty in the sense of the liberty
of the person … and the freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention”.
Secondly, s 377A was “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1) because
it had a clear core of meaning and was not unconstitutionally vague.
Thirdly, Art 9(1) did not protect a person’s sexual identity or
orientation, regardless of whether or not that was an immutable
aspect of a person’s identity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The preliminary issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     From
the procedural history set out above, it can be seen that the following
two preliminary issues were <em>originally</em> raised
in CA 54/2013:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     Do
Lim and Chee have the requisite <em>locus standi</em> to
challenge the constitutionality of s 377A?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Should
Lim and Chee be allowed to amend their OS to include new arguments
centring on how s 377A violates Art 9?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As noted above (at [31]), the Respondent indicated in its
letter to Ms Barker dated 1 July 2014 that it was no longer pursuing
the first of the aforesaid preliminary issues – in particular, because
the <em>locus standi</em> point had not been
raised before the Judge in the proceedings below. By that same letter, the
Respondent stated that it was also not objecting to Lim and Chee’s application
for leave to amend their OS to include new arguments centring on
how s 377A violated Art 9. Both of the above preliminary issues
are therefore no longer live issues before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We
would add that, in any event, had it been necessary for us to decide
SUM 3664/2013, we would have allowed the application. In their supporting
affidavit for SUM 3664/2013, Lim and Chee averred that the constitutionality
of s 377A was a matter of public interest, and that the proposed
amendment to their OS would allow this court to consider the merits
of all the arguments relating to whether or not s 377A was unconstitutional
and determine once and for all whether s 377A violated Art 12 and/or
Art 9. Lim and Chee further contended that there would be no prejudice
to the Respondent if the proposed amendment to their OS were allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
court has a wide discretion to allow an amendment of an OS at any
stage of the proceedings on such terms as to costs or otherwise
as may be just (see O 20 r 5(1) read with O 20 r 7 of the Rules
of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)). In a similar vein (although
not applicable in the present appeals), a party may introduce on
appeal a new point not taken in the court below, but it must state
this clearly in its case (see O 57 r 9A(4)(<em>b</em>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We
are of the view that Lim and Chee’s proposed amendment to their OS
would not cause the Respondent any prejudice which cannot be compensated
in costs (see the decision of this court in <em>Review
Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</em> [2010]
1 SLR 52 (“<em>Review Publishing Co</em>”)
at [113]). The proposed amendment would give symmetry to the present
appeals and allow a broader spectrum of arguments to be aired on
an important constitutional point in the Singapore context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The substantive issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
present appeals raise several overlapping arguments about the constitutionality
of s 377A. These boil down to whether s 377A violates the following
provisions of the Singapore Constitution:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     Art 9(1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Art 12(1);
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     Art 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We shall discuss each of these substantive issues in turn,
beginning with the issue of whether s 377A violates Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether s 377A violates Art 9(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Article 9,
part of which was set out above at [2], provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Liberty
of the person</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9.</b>—(1) No person shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Where a person is arrested, he shall

with clauses (3) and (4), and, in particular, nothing in this Article
shall affect the validity or operation of any such law before 10th March
1978.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The
arguments raised by Mr Ravi and by Ms Barker on Art 9 in the present
appeals are different. Ms Barker argues that the right to life and personal
liberty under Art 9(1) should include a limited right to privacy
and personal autonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection
and love towards another human being. Mr Ravi, on the other hand,
contends that s 377A is vague, arbitrary and absurd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In
so far as Ms Barker’s arguments are concerned, our view is that
the right to privacy and personal autonomy which she canvassed should
not be read into the phrase “life or personal liberty” in Art 9(1)
for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     
          <em>First</em>, such an interpretation of Art 9(1)
would be contrary to established Singapore jurisprudence. The phrase
“personal liberty” in Art 9(1) refers only to the personal liberty
of a person from unlawful incarceration or detention (see <em>Tan Eng Hong (standing)</em> at [120], affirming <em>Lo Pui Sang and others v Mamata Kapilev Dave and
others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and other appeals</em> [2008]
4 SLR(R) 754). Although the phrase “life” has not been authoritatively
interpreted by the Singapore courts, it should be interpreted narrowly
in accordance with the jurisprudence on “personal liberty” and Art 9’s
context and structure, which brings us to our next point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Our <em>second</em> reason for rejecting Ms Barker’s
arguments on Art 9 is that the narrow interpretation of Art 9(1)
which we have just mentioned above at [45] is (as the Respondent
has correctly argued) supported by the context and structure of
Art 9 itself. Articles 9(2) to 9(4) provide various procedural safeguards
in relation to the arrest and detention of a person. Article 9(2)
gives expression to the common law prerogative writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>; Art 9(3) provides for an
arrested person’s right to counsel and the right to be informed
of the grounds for his arrest; and Art 9(4) relates to the production
of an arrested person before a magistrate within 48 hours. Articles 9(5)
and 9(6) contain exceptions to the rights guaranteed to an arrested
person. Read in this context, it is clear that the phrase “life
or personal liberty” in Art 9(1) refers only to a person’s freedom
from an unlawful deprivation of life and unlawful detention or incarceration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     
          <em>Thirdly</em>, protection against unlawful detention
is the particular focus of Art 21 of the Indian Constitution, from
which our Art 9 is derived. India’s Art 21 states that “[n]o person
shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law”. As the Respondent has argued (again,
correctly, in our view), the framers of India’s Art 21 consciously
rejected the wider US formulation “without due process of law” in
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution, and
enacted additional provisions similar to Singapore’s Art 9(3) and Art 9(4)
to protect India’s citizenry against unlawful detention. There is
no indication that they intended to impute an expansive meaning
into the phrase “life or personal liberty”. India’s Art 21 was the
basis for the “liberty of the person” provision in Art 5(1) of the
Malaysian Constitution, which was later adopted in Singapore as
Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
a related vein, foreign cases that have conferred an expansive constitutional
right to life and liberty should be approached with circumspection
because they were decided in the context of their unique social,
political and legal circumstances. For example, the Supreme Court
of India has taken an expansive view of the right to life to include
an individual’s right to health and medical care. This approach
must be understood in the context of India’s social and economic
conditions (see <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> at
[83]–[84]). A similarly broad approach has been adopted in the US
because of the due process clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the US Constitution, which are materially different from our
Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Indeed,
it is significant that Ms Barker herself conceded that the <em>private</em> law relating to privacy was a <em>developing</em> one. It is clear that Lim and Chee
(and likewise, Tan in CA 125/2013) cannot obtain by the (constitutional)
backdoor what they cannot obtain by the (private law) front door.
Indeed, that would be a wholly inappropriate utilisation of the existing
body of <em>constitutional</em> law (which
serves <em>a quite different</em> function). More
importantly, as we have already noted above (at [30]), Lim and Chee base
their Art 9(1) rights on a narrow conception of the right to privacy, <em>viz</em>, that the right to life and personal
liberty under Art 9(1) should include a limited right to privacy
and personal autonomy allowing a person to enjoy and express affection
and love towards another human being. Once again, such a right ought,
in our view, to be developed by way of the <em>private</em> law
on privacy instead. Indeed, we also observe that the right claimed
by Lim and Chee, although of an apparently limited nature, is, in
point of fact, not only vague and general, but also contains within
itself (contradictorily) the seeds of an <em>unlimited</em> right.
Put simply, such a right could be interpreted to encompass as well
as legalise all manner of subjective expressions of love and affection,
which could (in turn) embody content that may be wholly unacceptable
from the perspective of broader societal policy. At this juncture,
we are, of course, back to “square one”, so to speak, for this brings us
back (in substance at least) to the issue of whether or not s 377A
ought to enforce broader societal morality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We
turn now to Mr Ravi’s arguments on the alleged unconstitutionality
of s 377A under Art 9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     First,
we do not think the phrase “act of gross indecency with another male
person” in s 377A is of such vagueness that would cause the provision to
fall outside the classification of “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1).
The concept of indecency is not alien to Singapore legislation (see,
for example, s 145(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev
Ed) and s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev
Ed)), and we do not think there is any objectionable degree of vagueness
inherent within s 377A itself. We would venture to suggest that
s 377A prohibits, at its core, sexual acts between males. The Judge’s
views on the operation of s 377A (in <em>Tan Eng
Hong (substantive)</em> at [76], [82] and [83]) were tentative
in nature <em>not</em> because the provision
was vague, <em>but</em> because the matter
before him did not involve a criminal charge under s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Secondly,
s 377A is not arbitrary. Mr Ravi’s submissions on this point are
not easily comprehensible, but they appear to suggest that there
is no rational purpose for s 377A. Mr Ravi asserted, without any
legal substantiation whatsoever, that the purpose of s 377A in signalling
societal disapproval of grossly indecent acts between males was
arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thirdly,
s 377A is not absurd. Mr Ravi argued that s 377A was absurd because
it criminalised a minority of citizens based on a core aspect of
their identity which was either unchangeable or suppressible only
at a great personal cost. As noted by the Respondent, Mr Ravi’s
argument here closely resembles Ms Barker’s argument that “personal
liberty” in Art 9(1) should be interpreted to include a limited
right to privacy and personal autonomy. For the reasons given above,
Mr Ravi’s argument in this particular guise must likewise be rejected.
In so far as the supposed immutability of a person’s sexual orientation
is concerned, the conflicting scientific views on this issue suggest
that there is, at present, no definitive conclusion, and it may
therefore be premature to express any conclusive views on it. Indeed, this
is precisely one of the <em>extra-legal</em> arguments
that is <em>not</em> within the remit of
this court (see above at [6]).</p>

begin our analysis of the constitutionality of s 377A under Art 12(1),

the constitutionality of s 377A is the central issue in these appeals, we

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable test for constitutionality:
the “reasonable classification” test</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The test articulated</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The
established test in Singapore for determining the constitutionality of
a statute under Art 12 is the <em>“reasonable classification”</em> test.
This is clear from the relevant case law (see, for example, <em>Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1979–1980]
SLR(R) 710 (“<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>”) at [37]; <em>Taw Cheng Kong (CA)</em> at [58]; <em>Nguyen Tuong Van</em> at [70]; <em>Yong
Vui Kong</em> at [109]; and <em>Tan Eng Hong
(standing)</em> at [124]). It should, however, be noted that
the “reasonable classification” test is not even engaged if the
impugned statute is not discriminatory in the first place. In the
words of Mohamed Azmi SCJ in the Malaysian Supreme Court decision
of <em>Malaysian Bar v Government of Malaysia</em> [1987]
2 MLJ 165 (“<em>Malaysian Bar</em>”) at 170 (referred
to in <em>Taw Cheng Kong (CA)</em> at [58]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The first question to be asked is, is
the law discriminatory, and that the answer should then be – if
the law is not discriminatory, it is good law …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, the question set out in the above quotation has been
referred to as the first stage of “a three-stage inquiry” (see,
for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Taw
Cheng Kong v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 78 at
[32]; that decision was reversed by this court in <em>Taw
Cheng Kong (CA)</em>, but without any apparent comment on
this particular point). Strictly speaking, however, the “reasonable
classification” test, in our view, comprises only two closely-related
stages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
“reasonable classification” test was articulated by, <em>inter alia</em>, this court in <em>Taw
Cheng Kong (CA)</em>, which, after referring to the above
passage from <em>Malaysian Bar</em>, went
on to cite (at [58]) Azmi SCJ’s observations in that same case (<em>viz</em>, <em>Malaysian Bar</em>)
as follows (at 170):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Discriminatory law is good law if it
is based on ‘reasonable’ or ‘permissible’ classification, provided
that</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    the
classification is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes
persons that are grouped together from others left out of the group;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   the differentia has a rational relation
to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. The
classification may be founded on different bases such as geographical,
or according to objects or occupations and the like. What is necessary
is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classification
and the object of the law in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     
          <em>Taw Cheng Kong (CA)</em> also cited (at [54])
the following comments by Lord Diplock in the Privy Council decision
of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> (at [35] and [37])
with approval:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    All
criminal law involves the classification of individuals for the purposes
of punishment, since it affects those individuals only in relation
to whom there exists a defined set of circumstances – the conduct
and, where relevant, the state of mind that constitute the ingredients
of an offence. <em>Equality before the law and
equal protection of the law require that like should be compared
with like. </em><em>What Art 12(1) of the
Constitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment
with other individuals in similar circumstances. It prohibits laws
which require that some individuals within a single class should
be treated by way of punishment more harshly than others</em>; it
does not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between one
class of individuals and another class in relation to which there
is some difference in the circumstances of the offences that has
been committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    …
Provided that the factor which the Legislature adopts as constituting the
dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears
a reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is
no inconsistency with Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added; emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Under
the “reasonable classification” test, therefore, a statute which prescribes
a differentiating measure will be consistent with Art 12(1) only if:
(a) the classification prescribed by the statute is founded on an intelligible
differentia; <em>and</em> (b) that differentia
bears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by
the statute (see also <em>Tan Eng Hong (standing)</em> at
[124]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The difficulties with the “reasonable
classification” test</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The true nature and
function of the test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The
“reasonable classification” test is not without its difficulties.
This has been articulated in the legal literature (see, for example,
Joseph Tussman &amp; Jacobus tenBroek, “The Equal Protection of
the Laws” (1949) 37 Cal L Rev 341). Perhaps because of the perceived
lack of viable alternative tests and the very thorny nature of the
concept of equality itself (especially when it is to be applied
in a <em>practical</em> context), the cases
(at least in the Singapore context) continue to endorse (only) the
“reasonable classification” test as the test for determining the
constitutionality of a statute under Art 12. The concept of equality
is thorny, not least because whilst it is eminently desirable (in
theory) to achieve equality, this (<em>normative</em>) <em>ideal</em> faces the (<em>factual</em>) <em>reality</em> that <em>inequality</em> (in
all its various forms) is <em>an inevitable part
of daily life</em>. How, then, is <em>the
law</em> to ensure that there is a <em>basic </em><em>level of equality</em>, applying the principle
of equality <em>generally</em>, and more
importantly, in <em>what situations</em> would
such a level of equality be deemed to be <em>legally
mandated</em>? As we shall see in a moment, the “reasonable
classification” test, whilst useful, <em>does not
really address the fundamental questions just posed</em> (see
also Peter Westen, “The Empty Idea of Equality” (1982) 95 Harv L Rev
537). This is not surprising because (as we shall also see) the <em>very nature</em> of the “reasonable classification”
test renders it <em>incapable</em> of furnishing
the requisite (or complete) normative as well as analytical impetus
(let alone the requisite criterion or criteria) to answer these
questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     However,
it is also of the first importance to note, at this juncture, that this
does <em>not</em> mean that the “reasonable
classification” test ought to be <em>rejected</em> out
of hand. That would be to throw the baby out together with the bathwater.
As we shall elaborate upon below, the “reasonable classification” test
is <em>an important threshold test</em>,
without which any attempt to determine whether or not Art 12 has
been contravened by an impugned statute cannot even take off the
ground in the first place. We shall also see that if a particular
statute fails to pass legal muster under this test, it would mean that
that statute <em>is so legally illogical and/or
incoherent that it would, </em>ipso facto<em>,
be repugnant to any idea of legal equality to begin with</em>.
The reader would be forgiven for thinking that all this is rather
general and abstract. Indeed, it is. However, it sets the stage
for the more detailed analysis that follows. It would, in fact,
be appropriate at this juncture to turn to an explanation of why
the “reasonable classification” test functions only as a <em>threshold</em> legal test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It
will be recalled (see above at, <em>inter alia</em>,
[60]) that the “reasonable classification” test states that a statute
which prescribes a differentiating measure will be consistent with
Art 12(1) only if: (a) <em>the </em><em>classification</em> prescribed by the statute
is founded on an <em>intelligible differentia</em> (referred
to hereafter as either “the first limb” or “Limb (a)” of the “reasonable classification”
test); <em>and</em> (b) <em>that
differentia</em> bears <em>a rational relation</em> to <em>the purpose and object</em> sought to be achieved
by the statute (referred to hereafter as either “the second limb”
or “Limb (b)” of the “reasonable classification” test). It is our
view that the <em>underlying rationale</em> of
both the aforementioned limbs of the “reasonable classification”
test is not only logical, but also commonsensical as well as self-evident.
Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In
our view, whilst it is clear that <em>both</em> Limb (a)
and Limb (b) must be satisfied in order for the “reasonable classification”
test as a whole to be satisfied, Limb (a) operates <em>prior
to</em> Limb (b) inasmuch as if the classification concerned
is <em>not</em> based on an <em>intelligible
differentia</em> to <em>begin </em><em>with</em>, then it is pointless for the court
to ascertain whether Limb (b) has been satisfied (<em>ie</em>,
whether <em>the differentia</em> bears <em>a rational relation</em> to <em>the purpose
and object</em> sought to be achieved by the statute in question).
This is only logical and commonsensical: if there is <em>no</em> intelligible differentia to <em>begin with</em>, <em>then</em> there
is <em>no</em> set of <em>intelligible</em> differentia <em>in existence</em> that can be <em>compared
with</em> the purpose and object of the statute (which is
the pith and marrow of Limb (b)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     When,
however, would a statute <em>fail</em> to
pass legal muster under the <em>threshold</em> legal
criterion embodied within Limb <em>(a)</em>?
The answer is that it would, in the nature of things, <em>very seldom</em> be the case. This is because
the differentia concerned need not be perfect; it need only be “<em>intelligible</em>”. This connotes (in turn)
a <em>relatively low threshold that ought to avoid
any consideration of substantive moral, political and/or ethical
issues because these issues are potentially (and in most instances,
actually) controversial</em>. We should note, parenthetically,
that when we refer to “controversy” with respect to moral, political
and/or ethical issues, we are not necessarily referring to anything
sinister, malevolent or even insidious in nature because <em>reasonable persons can reasonably disagree on a myriad
of issues which arise in moral, political and/or ethical contexts</em>. <em>More importantly, it is no business of the courts
or the law generally to engage in the resolution of such issues
– except to the extent necessary to resolve any </em><b><em>legal </em></b><em>issue(s) at hand</em>.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the (legal) criterion centring
on the need for an <em>intelligible</em> differentia
under Limb <em>(a)</em> is (as already mentioned) <em>a relatively low threshold</em> that only requires
the differentia concerned to be based on <em>intelligibility</em>.
In this regard, the Judge observed thus in <em>Lim
Meng Suang</em> (at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The First Limb [<em>ie</em>,
Limb (a)] requires that the classification prescribed by the impugned
legislation must be based on an intelligible differentia. “Intelligible”
means something that may be understood or is capable of being apprehended
by the intellect or understanding, as opposed to by the senses. “Differentia”
is used in the sense of a distinguishing mark or character, some attribute
or feature by which one is distinguished from all others. Scientifically,
one talks of an attribute by which a species is distinguished from
all other species of the same genus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We
agree with the Judge’s observations. They may appear value-neutral,
but that is precisely what, in our view, was intended by the criterion of
intelligible differentia to begin with. Value-neutrality is not
the same as redundancy or an absence of functionality. As alluded
to earlier, the “reasonable classification” test in general and
its component limbs in particular are only intended to (and, in
the nature of things, can only) serve a minimal <em>threshold</em> function
of requiring logic and coherence in the statute concerned, without
which the court cannot meaningfully proceed in any event to determine
whether that statute violates Art 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In
the context of Limb <em>(a)</em>, what this
means is that the differentia embodied in the impugned statute must
not only identify a clear distinguishing mark or character, but
must <em>also</em> be <em>intelligible</em> (as
opposed to illogical and/or incoherent). In this regard, we would
go a little further than the Judge, although we think that our view
is at least implicit within his observations in any event. In particular,
we are of the view that a differentia which is capable of being
understood or which “is capable of being apprehended by the intellect
or understanding” (see <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at
[47]) may <em>nevertheless</em> still be <em>un</em>intelligible to the extent that it is <em>so unreasonable as to be illogical and/or incoherent</em>.
We recognise that this last-mentioned proposition may open the doors
to potential abuse, so we include the caveat that the illogicality
and/or incoherence must be of <em>an extreme nature</em>.
It must be so extreme that <em>no reasonable person</em> would
ever contemplate the differentia concerned as being functional as <em>intelligible</em> differentia. Put simply,
the illogicality and/or incoherence of the differentia concerned
must be such that there can be no reasonable dispute (let alone controversy)
as to that fact from a moral, political and/or ethical point of view
(or, for that matter, any other point of view). Where such illogicality and/or
incoherence is present, there is no point even beginning to talk about
the concept of equality (let alone whether there has been a violation of
the right to equality contrary to Art 12) because <em>no
reasonable classification even exists in the first place</em>.
In such circumstances, Limb <em>(b)</em> is <em>not engaged at all</em>. More generally, there
would be no way in which the statute concerned can possibly pass
legal muster in so far as the concept of equality embodied within
Art 12 is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Assuming,
however, that there is an intelligible differentia in place such
that Limb (a) of the “reasonable classification” test is in fact
satisfied, it must <em>further</em> be demonstrated
that Limb (b) has been satisfied <em>as well</em> in order
for the “reasonable classification” test as a whole to be satisfied.
To recapitulate, where Limb (b) is concerned, it must be demonstrated
that <em>the differentia</em> identified
pursuant to Limb (a) bears <em>a rational relation</em> to <em>the purpose and object</em> sought to be achieved
by the statute in question. It is clear that a prerequisite for
the satisfaction of Limb (b) is that the <em>purpose and
object</em> of the statute in question <em>must
first be determined or ascertained</em>. Once that purpose
and object has been determined or ascertained, <em>a rational
relation</em> between the differentia identified pursuant
to Limb (a) <em>and</em> that purpose and
object must then be demonstrated in order for Limb (b) to be satisfied.
Again, this is both logical as well as commonsensical: if there
is no rational relation between the differentia identified pursuant
to Limb (a) and the purpose and object of the statute concerned,
there is, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, no logical
and/or coherent basis upon which to hold that the statute is based on <em>reasonable</em> classification to begin with.
Although the absence of such a rational relation can take many forms,
it seems to us that the requisite rational relation will – more
often than not – be found. This is because (as the Judge held in <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at [98]) there is <em>no</em> need for <em>a perfect</em> relation
or “<em>complete</em> coincidence” [emphasis
added] between the differentia in question and the purpose and object
of the statute concerned. As the “reasonable classification” test
itself prescribes, the relation need only be a <em>rational</em> one.
That having been said, this does <em>not necessarily</em> mean that
a rational relation will <em>always</em> be
found to exist by the courts. For example, if there is <em>a clear disconnect</em> between the purpose
and object of the impugned statute on the one hand and the relevant
differentia on the other, the “reasonable classification” test will
be held <em>not</em> to have been satisfied. But,
all this is easily stated in the abstract. What will determine the
final outcome in any given case will be <em>the
specific facts as well as context</em> before the court. We
should add, at this juncture, that ascertaining the purpose and
object of a statute will not always be easy. Indeed, as we shall
see later in this judgment (below at [116]–[152]), ascertaining
the purpose and object of s 377A is both an extremely complex as
well as extremely difficult exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As
is the position with regard to Limb (a), the key inquiry under Limb (b)
does <em>not</em> really address the concept
of <em>equality</em> as such. Its focus,
as explained above, is primarily logical as well as commonsensical.
Put simply, if there is no rational relation between the relevant
differentia on the one hand and the purpose and object of the statute
concerned on the other, there is (again) no point even beginning
to talk about the concept of equality (let alone whether there has
been a violation of the right to equality contrary to Art 12) because <em>no</em> reasonable classification even exists <em>in the first place</em>. Furthermore, if Limb (b)
is not satisfied, it would also follow that the statute in question <em>cannot possibly</em> satisfy the concept of
equality embodied within Art 12 <em>in any event</em> –
a result that will likewise obtain if Limb (a) is not satisfied
(as noted above at [64] and [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It
should be noted that the threshold nature of the “reasonable classification”
test helps to <em>balance</em> the need to
accord as much legislative leeway as possible to the legislature
against the need to ensure that laws which are patently illogical
and/or incoherent do not pass legal muster. In a related vein, this
test simultaneously prevents the courts from becoming “mini-legislatures”
(a point which is dealt with in more detail below, especially at
[77]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As
mentioned above at [61]–[62], the fact that the “reasonable classification”
test is a threshold test which does not in itself furnish the requisite
criteria for determining whether the right to equality under Art 12 has
been violated does <em>not</em> mean that
this test ought therefore to be dispensed with. Indeed, it is quite <em>the opposite</em>. As we pointed out earlier
(at [62] above), the “reasonable classification” test serves a minimal
– <em>but vital</em> – threshold function
of requiring logic and coherence in the statute concerned, without
which the court cannot meaningfully proceed to determine whether
that statute contravenes Art 12. Put simply, there is no point analysing
the statute concerned from the perspective of the concept of equality
if the “reasonable classification” test is not even satisfied in
the first place. <em>Looked at in this light, the
“reasonable classification” test is by no means a merely mechanical
or purely procedural test. It does, in fact, contain substantive
elements.</em> That having been said, it is important to reiterate
at the same time that the “reasonable classification” test <em>in itself</em> does not really aid the court
in ascertaining whether or not the concept of equality under Art 12<em>(1)</em> has been violated. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The “reasonable classification”
test in relation to the concept of equality in Art 12(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It
will be recalled that Art 12(1) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Equal
protection</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>12.</b>—(1) All persons are <b><em>equal before the law </em></b><b><em><u>and </u></em></b><b><em>entitled to the equal protection of the law</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics and underlined
bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It
will be seen that Art 12(1) comprises two main limbs. The <em>first</em> states that “[a]ll persons are <em>equal before the law</em>” [emphasis added].
No reasonable person would seriously attempt to controvert this
particular statement as it is just and fair from both a logical
as well as an intuitive point of view. However, what precisely does
it mean when we state that “[a]ll persons are equal before the law”?
In the first place, what does the phrase “the law” in this particular
limb of Art 12(1) mean? Does it refer to <em>the
law in general</em>? If so, then this particular limb is no
more than a <em>declaratory</em> statement
that is, as just alluded to, self-evident. Alternatively, does the
phrase “the law” refer specifically to the statute that is sought
to be impugned as being inconsistent with Art 12(1) and, hence,
unconstitutional pursuant to Art 4? In the context of the present
appeals, “the law” would then refer to s 377A. But, even if that
be the case, this limb of Art 12(1) does not really assist us in
so far as the concept of equality is concerned – on <em>what
legal basis and on what legal criterion (or criteria)</em> can
the court find that a particular person or group of persons has
not been accorded equality of treatment in relation to s 377A? Presumably,
all those who fall within the scope of s 377A would be considered
to be “equal” before that particular provision, but that would hardly
be an argument which the Appellants would want to rely upon. If
the Appellants seek to argue that they are not being accorded equal
treatment because s 377A applies only to them (<em>ie</em>, Lim,
Chee and Tan) and no other male homosexuals, that would be an entirely
separate and distinct argument which would require a separate criterion
(or set of criteria) for determining whether the Appellants’ Art 12(1)
rights have indeed been violated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     What,
then, about the second limb of Art 12(1), which states that “[a]ll
persons are … <em>entitled to the equal protection
of the law</em>” [emphasis added]? As in the case of the first
limb, what does “the law” in this second limb refer to? If it refers
to <em>the law in general</em>, then, likewise
as in the case of the first limb, the second limb would be no more
than a <em>declaratory</em> statement which
is, by its very nature, self-evident. Alternatively, if the phrase
“the law” in the second limb of Art 12(1) refers to the impugned statute
(in the present appeals, s 377A), this would be of no assistance
to the Appellants since they are <em>not</em> seeking
equal <em>protection </em><em>under</em> s 377A.
Indeed, what they desire is <em>quite different</em>,
in that what they are seeking is <em>protection from </em><b><em>prosecution under</em></b> s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It
should be noted that Ms Barker, in her oral submissions before this court,
was of the view that the two aforementioned limbs of Art 12(1) ought to
be read as an integrated whole. We agree with this to the extent
that the second limb follows from the first. However, this does
not preclude (for the purposes of analytical clarity) the approach
to the two limbs which has just been set out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there an additional test
of illegitimacy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     We
pause at this juncture to deal with the Judge’s observation in <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> that a statute can still
be rendered unconstitutional <em>even if</em> it satisfies
the “reasonable classification” test, <em>provided</em> it
can be demonstrated that the <em>object</em> of
that statute is <em>illegitimate</em> (at
[114]–[116]). Not surprisingly, the Appellants have endorsed this
particular proposition. We also note that counsel for the Respondent,
Mr Aedit Abdullah SC (“Mr Abdullah”), whilst not purporting to endorse
this proposition <em>in toto</em>, indicated
that he was willing (but only by way of a fallback argument) to admit
to a test of <em>unreasonableness</em> along
the lines embodied in this court’s decision in <em>Yong
Vui Kong</em> (at [111]–[119]) and the seminal English Court of
Appeal decision of <em>Associated Provincial Picture
Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation</em> [1948] 1 KB
223 (“<em>Wednesbury</em>”) (<em>cf</em><em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at [116]). We note, parenthetically,
that there was no real elaboration by Mr Abdullah with regard to
the Respondent’s reliance on <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> in
this connection. In so far as the test of unreasonableness in <em>Wednesbury</em> is concerned, Lord Greene MR
(with whom Somervell LJ and Singleton J agreed) described the requisite
level of unreasonableness as involving (in the context of administrative
law) a decision or conclusion that was “so unreasonable that no
reasonable [public] authority could ever have come to it” (see <em>Wednesbury</em> at 230 and 234). We would,
with respect, <em>differ</em> from <em>all</em> these aforementioned views. Let us
elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It
is important to commence our analysis in this regard by referring
to a fundamental proposition that constitutes part of the wider
concept of the separation of powers. Put simply, the courts are <em>separate and distinct from</em> the legislature.
More specifically, whilst the courts do “make” law, this is only
permissible in the context of the interpretation of statutes and
the development of the principles of common law and equity. It is <em>im</em>permissible for <em>the
courts</em> to arrogate to themselves <em>legislative
powers</em> – to become, in other words, “<em>mini-legislatures</em>”.
This must necessarily be the case because the courts have no mandate
whatsoever to create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse
to <em>extra-legal policy factors as well as considerations</em>.
The jurisdiction as well as the power to do so lie exclusively within
the sphere of <em>the legislature</em>. Indeed,
the power of the legislature to enact and amend laws is governed
by quite a different procedure. Hence, the duty of a court is to <em>interpret</em> statutes enacted by the legislature;
it <em>cannot amend or modify statutes</em> based
on its own personal preference or fiat as that would be an obvious
(and unacceptable) usurpation of the <em>legislative</em> function.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The
legislative powers which we have just discussed are different from the
court’s role in developing the law – a task which it frequently undertakes.
As already alluded to above, the courts do indeed develop the principles
of common law and equity. Indeed, as Lord Reid famously observed
in an extra-judicial lecture (see “The Judge As Law Maker” (1972–1973)
12 JSPTL (NS) 22 (“<em>The Judge As Law Maker</em>”)
at p 22):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was a time when it was thought almost
indecent to suggest that judges make law – they only declare it.
Those with a taste for fairy tales seem to have thought that in
some Aladdin’s cave there is hidden the Common Law in all its splendour
and that on a judge’s appointment there descends on him knowledge
of the magic words Open Sesame. Bad decisions are given when the
judge has muddled the pass word and the wrong door opens. But we
do not believe in fairy tales any more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The
process of such development is, however, <em>quite
different</em> from the process of <em>legislative</em> enactment
or amendment of legislation, and is effected through <em>development of case law</em>. In this regard,
it should be noted that <em>the legislature</em> can <em>reject</em> existing principles of common law
and equity. Put simply, the legislature can enact a statute <em>overruling</em> an existing principle of common
law or equity if the legislature thinks it fit to do so. However, absent
such a situation, the courts can – and do – develop the principles
of common law and equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     A
paradigm example of this may be seen in the law of negligence, commencing
with the seminal House of Lords decision of <em>M’Alister
(or Donoghue) (Pauper) v Stevenson</em> [1932] AC 562 (more
commonly cited as “<em>Donoghue v Stevenson</em>”
and referred to hereafter as “<em>Donoghue</em>”).
This decision effected a sea change in this foundational area of
the law of tort (see generally the valuable background prior to
this decision furnished in Edward H Levi, <em>An
Introduction to Legal Reasoning</em> (University of Chicago Press,
1949), as well as equally valuable background pertaining to the decision
itself in Geoffrey Lewis, <em>Lord Atkin</em> (Butterworths,
1983; reprinted, Hart Publishing, 1999) at pp 51–67; see also Matthew
Chapman, <em>The Snail and the Ginger Beer: The
Singular Case of Donoghue v Stevenson</em> (Wildy, Simmonds
&amp; Hill Publishing, 2009) and <em>The Juridical
Review – Donoghue v Stevenson: The Paisley Papers</em> (<em>Special Edition</em>) (2013)). Indeed, the
law of negligence has developed even further since <em>Donoghue</em>.
For example, the House of Lords extended the law of negligence to
cover liability for negligent misstatements in its path-breaking
decision in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller
&amp; Partners Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465 (“<em>Hedley
Byrne</em>”). In this regard, and several years prior to the
decision of the House in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>, Denning LJ
(as he then was) adopted precisely the legal position which was ultimately
endorsed in <em>Hedley Byrne</em> itself,
but found himself in a <em>minority</em> in
the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Candler
v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co</em> [1951] 2 KB 164 (“<em>Candler v Crane</em>”). Indeed, Denning LJ
significantly referred in an extra-legal context to his powerful
dissenting judgment in <em>Candler v Crane</em> as
his “most important judgment” (see Lord Denning’s “Foreword” to
the inaugural volume of the <em>Denning Law Journal</em> ([1986] Denning LJ
1 at p 1)). In the course of delivering his judgment in that case, Denning LJ
drew a distinction (at 178) between “timorous souls who were fearful
of allowing a new cause of action” and “bold spirits who were ready to
allow it [<em>viz</em>, a new cause of action]
if justice so required”. Indeed, the ultimate vindication by the
House of Lords in <em>Hedley Byrne</em> of
Denning LJ’s views in <em>Candler v Crane</em> bears
ample testimony to the virtues of the courts being “bold spirits”.
And something of that spirit can be seen in the course of the development
of the law of negligence in countries where English law has been
transplanted – as witnessed, for example, in the decision of this court
in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence
Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (see
also generally the valuable survey as well as analysis in David
Tan &amp; Goh Yihan, “The Promise of Universality – The <em>Spandeck</em> Formulation Half a Decade on”
(2013) 25 SAcLJ 510).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The
briefest of summaries of the development of the law of negligence set
out in the preceding paragraph is but one illustration not only
of the nature of the courts’ development of the principles of common
law and equity, but also (and more importantly in the context of
the present appeals) of the fact that the courts will not hesitate
to develop the law <em>in appropriate circumstances</em>,
taking on the nature of “bold spirits” in those circumstances (indeed,
Ms Barker herself <em>supported</em> this
particular point by citing decisions of this court on the development
of <em>the common law</em> in her further
written reply submissions in an attempt to persuade this court to adopt
a more activist approach towards the interpretation of Art 12(1);
the decisions which she cited in this regard were <em>Lau
Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R)
108 and <em>Chandran a/l </em><em>Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd (Owners of the Ship
or Vessel “Tasman Mariner”, third party)</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R)
995). <em>However</em>, in <em>other</em> situations,
the courts will necessarily be more circumspect. This is especially
the case with respect to matters which are uniquely within the sphere
of <em>the legislature</em>. Whilst, for
example, a court will not hesitate to <em>interpret</em> a
statute, it will <em>not – indeed, cannot – amend
or modify </em><em>a statute</em> based
on its own personal preference or fiat (or even <em>its</em> view
of what <em>it thinks</em> the relevant <em>extra-legal considerations should be</em>)
because (as already noted above at [77]) that would be an obvious
and unacceptable usurpation of the <em>legislative</em> function.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Here,
we come to the crux of the issue at hand. To permit the court the
power – <em>over and above</em> its power
of scrutinising legislation pursuant to <em>the
“reasonable classification” test –</em> to declare a statute
inconsistent with Art 12(1) (and, therefore, unconstitutional under
Art 4) because the <b><em>object</em></b> of that
statute is <em>illegitimate would precisely be
to confer on the court a licence to usurp the legislative function
in the course of becoming (or at least acting like) a “mini-legislature”</em>.
Put another way, <em>only the legislature has the power
to review its own legislation and amend legislation accordingly
if it is of the view that this is necessary</em>. The <em>courts</em>, in contrast, have <em>no</em> such
power – <em>nor ought they to have such power.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Indeed,
to argue, as the Appellants seemed to do, that the court has the
duty to declare a statute unconstitutional if its object is “illegitimate” <em>does not explain the legal basis upon which the court
can find the object to be illegitimate in the first place</em>.
If the argument is that the object of the statute is illegitimate
because that object is unconstitutional, this would lead to a circularity
which, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, lacks the requisite
explanatory as well as normative power. The courts are called upon
– and ought – to be “bold spirits”, <em>but </em><b><em>only </em></b><em>on </em><b><em>appropriate </em></b><em>occasions.</em> Put
simply, they <em>cannot</em> claim to act
as “bold spirits” <em>when they are in fact acting
outside their proper sphere of jurisdiction.</em> This point
will become particularly important in the analysis below – especially
in the face of the Appellants’ calls to this court to update the
law on s 377A based purely on <em>extra-legal arguments</em> which
are <em>appropriate only</em> in the <em>legislative</em> sphere. <em>Put
simply but clearly, to permit the court to effectively amend (as
opposed to interpret) the law in this area would not only entail
the court acting beyond its jurisdiction, but also permit the Appellants
to obtain by the (judicial) backdoor what they ought to have sought
to obtain by the (legislative) front door.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     That
having been said, <em>an important qualification</em> is
in order at this juncture. The important qualification is this:
to the extent that there are <em>serious flaws</em> with
regard to the <em>intelligibility</em> of
the differentia embodied in a statute and/or a <em>clear
disconnect</em> between that differentia and the purpose and
object of the statute, the court will hold that the statute does
not pass legal muster under Art 12(1). <em>This
may be viewed, in substance at least, as introducing a limited </em><em>element of illegitimacy </em><em>which
is embodied in the “reasonable classification” test. </em><em>However, it is vitally important to note that this
element </em><em>of illegitimacy is </em><b><em>not </em></b><em>an additional
test over and above the “reasonable classification” test; it is</em>,<em>instead, no more than an application of the “reasonable
classification” test.</em> The only <em>legal</em> test
for the purposes of Art 12(1) is the “reasonable classification”
test, and it is important to note that in applying this test, the
court would be applying a <b><em>legal </em></b><em>test that is not based on extra-legal considerations</em>,<em>but rather, one that is clearly within its remit
as a court of law </em><em>(as opposed to
acting as if it were a “mini-legislature”)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Put
simply, in determining the constitutionality of an impugned statute
under Art 12(1), there are <em>no legal standards</em> which
can guide the court in ascertaining whether the object of that statute
is illegitimate. In the nature of things, any purported standards
would be <em>extra-legal</em> in nature. This
brings us back to the point just made – that <em>the
legislature</em> is the appropriate forum to canvass the issue
of whether or not the object of a particular statute is illegitimate
because the extra-legal standards pertinent to such an issue would
be quintessentially within the sphere of legislative review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     At
this juncture, we note (as mentioned above at [76]) that Mr Abdullah
was prepared (albeit only by way of a fallback position) to endorse
the test in <em>Wednesbury</em>. This particular
test is premised on the concept of <em>unreasonableness</em>.
Whilst it does constitute a legal standard, it is not, in our view,
an appropriate legal standard in the context of a challenge to the <em>constitutionality</em> of a statute. More importantly, <em>even if</em> the concept of unreasonableness
laid down in <em>Wednesbury</em> were applicable,
it would not aid this court inasmuch as the present constitutional
challenge to s 377A is premised on <em>extra-legal</em> arguments
which, as we have already noted, are quintessentially within the
purview of <em>the legislature</em>. It also
bears reiterating what has just been alluded to above at [84] – <em>viz</em>, that in situations of <em>extreme illogicality and/or incoherence</em>,
the statute concerned would probably <em>not</em> be
able to pass legal muster under one <em>or</em> both
limbs of <em>the “reasonable classification” test</em> in
any event. Indeed, in such situations, the statute might possibly
infringe <em>other</em> Articles of the Singapore Constitution
as well (<em>cf</em> also <em>Lim
Meng Suang</em> at [116]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We
note that Ms Barker cited <em>Report of the Constitutional Commission
1966</em> (27 August 1966) (“the 1966 Report”), the report
of the constitutional commission chaired by the then Chief Justice Wee
Chong Jin, to buttress her argument that Art 12<em>(1)</em> ought
to be invoked by this court (via a declaration of s 377A’s unconstitutionality)
in order to ensure that the Appellants were accorded equality before
the law. In particular, Ms Barker referred to para 32 of the 1966
Report, which dealt with Art 8 of the then Constitution of Malaysia
(the equivalent of Singapore’s present Art 12) and which stated
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We deal now with Article 8 of the present
Constitution of Malaysia. Having regard to our Terms of Reference,
our recommendations on the form and substance that this Article
should take and contain will constitute the very core of our views
on the whole problem of minority rights in Singapore. <em>In the first place we deem it essential that the
principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the
law for all persons should be clearly and categorically laid down.</em><b><em>Secondly, it should be no less clearly and categorically
laid down that there shall be</em></b><b><em><u>no
discrimination</u></em></b><b><em>in any law or in the
effect of any law, except as expressly authorised by the Constitution, against
any citizen on the ground</em></b><b><em><u>only</u></em></b><b><em>of</em></b><b><em><u>race, religion,
place of birth</u></em></b><b><em>or</em></b><b><em><u>descent</u></em></b><b><em>.</em></b><b><em>Lastly, it should also be clearly and categorically
laid down that there shall be</em></b><b><em><u>no
discrimination</u></em></b><b><em>in the administration
of any law, except as expressly authorised by the Constitution,
against any person on the ground</em></b><b><em><u>only</u></em></b><b><em>of</em></b><b><em><u>race, religion,
place of birth</u></em></b><b><em>or</em></b><b><em><u>descent</u></em></b>. [emphasis added in italics, bold
italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Ms Barker
relied on all the italicised words set out in the above quotation
to support the argument mentioned in the preceding paragraph. In
our view, the sentence “In the first place we deem it essential
that the principle of equality before the law and equal protection
of the law for all persons should be clearly and categorically laid
down” is but <em>a paraphrase of</em> the
language of Art 12(1) itself, and to that extent, is clearly declaratory and
aspirational in nature (see also below at [90]). For the reasons explained
above (at [73]–[74]), this particular sentence (like the words in Art 12(1))
does not really set out any concrete <em>legal</em> principles
which can guide the courts, such as the “reasonable classification”
test. Indeed, the “reasonable classification” test itself was formulated
by the courts, and it does (as we have explained above) furnish
the courts with particular <em>legal</em> principles
that give effect (albeit not fully) to the concept of equality embodied
in Art 12(1). Significantly, the last two sentences of para 32 of
the 1966 Report, which correspond to Art 12<em>(2)</em>,
refer <em>specifically</em> to the concept of
“<em>discrimination</em>” [emphasis added],
albeit in the context of the proscription of discrimination <em>on specific grounds</em> (as opposed to a general proscription
of discrimination as such). Indeed, that the <em>specific
and applicable principles relating to the right to equality under
the Singapore Constitution are located in Art 12(2) – rather than
Art 12(1) – is confirmed by the following extract from the very
next paragraph of the 1966 Report (</em>viz<em>, para 33)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We consider, having regard to <em>the multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and
multi-religious composition of the population of Singapore and of
its citizens</em>, that <b><em>the recommendations
we have outlined in the preceding paragraph</em></b> will not
only <em>form an impregnable shield against racial communalism
and religious bigotry as well as an effective weapon to wipe away any
fears the minorities may harbour concerning discriminatory treatment
but will also lay a firm and lasting foundation on which to build
a democratic, equal and just multi-racial society in Singapore</em>.
… [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Read in its proper context, the reference to “recommendations”
in the extract just quoted is clearly a reference to the principles
embodied in Art 12<em>(2)</em>, and <em>not</em> Art 12<em>(1)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     This
would be an appropriate point to turn to a consideration of the legal
relationship between Art 12(1) and Art 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal relationship between
Art 12(1) and Art 12(2)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Art 12(1) and Art 12(2) read
inter se</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     To
recapitulate, the analysis proffered above at [73]–[74] is that Art 12<em>(1)</em> appears to be more of a <em>declaratory (as well as aspirational) statement of
principles</em>, as opposed to a set of specific legal criteria
as such. This is, perhaps, not surprising as Art 12(1) is framed
at <em>a very general level</em>. Indeed,
as alluded to in the analysis proffered above, the two limbs of Art 12(1)
are both logically and intuitively attractive, and their content would
not be something that a reasonable and fair-minded person would seriously
controvert. However, it is perhaps precisely because Art 12(1) is framed
at such a general level that it does not furnish the <em>specific</em> legal criteria which can guide
the courts in determining, in specific fact situations, whether
a particular statute violates Art 12. That having been said, it
bears reiterating that any statute <em>must</em> nevertheless
pass (threshold) muster under the <em>“reasonable
classification” test</em> before it can be found to be consistent
with Art 12. More importantly, we emphasise that what we have just
said (about the lack of specific legal criteria in Art 12(1)) does <em>not</em> mean that there are no specific legal
criteria which can guide the court in specific fact situations.
On the contrary, <em>in addition</em> to
the <em>“reasonable classification” test</em>,
Art 12<em>(2)</em> furnishes specific as
well as concrete legal criteria which ensure that any statute which
is <em>discriminatory within the scope and meaning
of Art 12(2)</em> (and, hence, contravenes the concept of
equality embodied in Art 12) will, pursuant to Art 4, be void to
the extent of such contravention and inconsistency. On a practical
level, parties are free to challenge the constitutionality of a
statute under Art 12(1) or Art 12(2) or, indeed, under both provisions
(as was the case here). The court’s decision on the constitutionality
(or otherwise) of the impugned statute would ultimately depend on
the particular facts and circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Article 12(2)
(also set out earlier at [55] above) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    
              <em>Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution</em>,
there <b><em>shall</em></b><em>be</em><b><em>no</em></b><b><em><u>discrimination</u></em></b><em>against</em><b><em>citizens
of Singapore</em></b><em>on the ground</em><b><em><u>only</u></em></b> of <b><em>religion</em></b>, <b><em>race</em></b>, <b><em>descent</em></b><em><u>or</u></em><b><em>place of birth
in any</em></b><b><em><u>law</u></em></b><em><u>or</u></em> in <b><em>the appointment
to any office or employment under a public authority</em></b><em><u>or</u></em> in <b><em>the administration
of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of
property</em></b><em><u>or</u></em><b><em>the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business,
profession, vocation or employment</em></b>. [emphasis added in
italics, underlined italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It
can immediately be seen that Art 12(2) furnishes <em>specific
legal criteria as to what constitutes discrimination and </em><em>is therefore prohibited from a constitutional perspective</em>.
In many ways, the approach adopted in Art 12(2) is more structured
and principled compared to the approach under open-ended constitutional
provisions in some other jurisdictions that place the courts in
the unenviable position of being (in effect) “mini-legislatures”
of sorts. It is also noteworthy (indeed, crucial, in so far as the present
appeals are concerned) that within the prohibited grounds of discrimination
delineated in Art 12(2), there is <em>no reference
to “sex”, “sexual orientation” or “gender”</em>. This is not
surprising. Not all Constitutions will be exactly the same. Each
Constitution is supposed to reflect the social mores of the society
which it emanates from. It is true that such social mores can – and
often will – change over time. However, there is nothing precluding
a legislature from <em>amending</em> the
Constitution accordingly. In the Singapore context, the provision
governing amendment of the Singapore Constitution is Art 5(2), which
states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Bill seeking to amend any provision in
this Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament unless it has
been supported on Second and Third Readings by the votes of not
less than two-thirds of the total number of the elected Members
of Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">An amendment of the Singapore Constitution is obviously <em>beyond</em> the remit of our courts. It is
nevertheless important to emphasise that the possibility of constitutional
amendment just referred to furnishes our Parliament with <em>the necessary flexibility to ensure that the Singapore
Constitution reflects the </em><b><em>prevailing </em></b><em>social mores as well as aspirations of Singapore
society.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Before
proceeding to consider some other constitutional provisions in a
comparative context, we ought to briefly address a further argument
by Ms Barker based on the fact that Art 12(2) applies <em>only</em> to <em>citizens
of Singapore</em>. She argued that in contrast, Art 12(1)
was framed more broadly to apply to “<em>[a]ll</em> persons”
[emphasis added], and hence (citing the paragraph of the 1966 Report
quoted above at [87]), Art 12(1) ought to be given an <em>expansive</em> interpretation that goes <em>beyond</em> the “reasonable classification”
test so as to accord equal protection to all persons. <em>However</em>, that brings us back full circle
to the difficulties outlined above (especially at [77]) to the effect
that the courts would then become “mini-legislatures”. Indeed, the
argument proffered by Ms Barker is a double-edged legal sword inasmuch
as if Art 12(1) could be construed and applied in the broad manner
which she suggested, why, then, was it necessary to promulgate Art 12<em>(2)</em>? After all, taking the broad approach
canvassed by Ms Barker, every prohibited ground of discrimination
referred to in Art 12(2) would <em>necessarily</em> be <em>subsumed</em> under Art 12(1) and Art 12(2)
would then be rendered redundant. <em>In any event,
nothing in this particular argument by Ms Barker impacts the respective
cases of not only her clients but also Mr Ravi’s client inasmuch
as all the Appellants are citizens of Singapore</em>. Be that
as it may, it also bears emphasising that even though we do not
accept Ms Barker’s argument that an expansive interpretation should
be given to Art 12(1), this does <em>not</em> mean
that <em>non</em>-citizens are <em>without any rights</em>. They have rights under
Art 12(1), in that they can avail themselves of <em>the “reasonable
classification” test</em>. Indeed, it can be said that <em>this is the general legal position in any event</em>.
It should also be borne in mind that non-citizens are also entitled
to other specific fundamental rights under the Singapore Constitution,
some of which are set out in the next paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It
is also not – in principle – unfair that <em>citizens
of Singapore</em> are given <em>further (and
entrenched) rights under Art 12(2)</em>. Indeed, there are
other fundamental rights in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution
which <em>only citizens of Singapore</em> can
avail themselves of (see, for example, Art 13 in relation to the
prohibition of banishment and the right to freedom of movement;
Art 14 in relation to the right of freedom of speech, assembly and
association (see also the decision of this court in <em>Review
Publishing Co</em> at [254] and [257]); and Art 16(1) in relation
to rights in respect of education). However, there are also many
other Articles in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution which (probably
because they impact <em>any</em> person in <em>the most fundamental</em> manner) apply to <em>all</em> persons (see, for example, Arts 9(1)–9(4)
in relation to liberty of the person; Art 10(1) in relation to the
prohibition of slavery and forced labour; Art 11 in relation to
protection against retrospective criminal laws and repeated trials;
and Art 15 in relation to freedom of religion). In any event, the
question of whether or not <em>non-</em>citizens
should be given similar rights as citizens of Singapore in the present
context, whether with respect to some or all of the prohibited grounds
of discrimination set out in Art 12(2) (or, albeit less probably, outside
Art 12(2)) is obviously something beyond the remit of the courts, and,
as already mentioned, is in any event irrelevant on the facts of
the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Comparative constitutional provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Constitutional provisions
which make express reference to “sex”, “sexual orientation” and/or
“gender”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It
is instructive, in our view, that in <em>contrast
to </em><em>Art 12(2)</em>, there are constitutional
provisions from other jurisdictions which <em>expressly

to take just one more (and even clearer) illustration, s 9 of ch 2

as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

that the discrimination is fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Open-ended constitutional
provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As
mentioned above at [92], there are, in contrast, <em>other</em> jurisdictions where
the corresponding constitutional provision on the right to equality
is <em>open-ended</em>. The paradigm example
is the US Constitution <em>–</em> in particular, the
Fourteenth Amendment, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">AMENDMENT XIV</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">SECTION 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">All persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens
of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State
shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    It
can be seen that the provision just quoted in the preceding paragraph
is open-ended inasmuch as <em>it does not contain
any equivalent of Art 12(2)</em>. Not surprisingly, therefore,
the US courts (in particular, the US Supreme Court) have taken the
view that different grounds of discrimination will attract different
levels of scrutiny, with the legal principles applicable to the
different grounds to be enunciated and developed through <em>case law</em>. Had, in fact, the Fourteenth
Amendment to the US Constitution contained a provision which was <em>equivalent to our Art 12(2)</em>, the position
might have been quite different. We pause to observe, parenthetically,
that an open-ended provision on the right to equality in a Constitution
brings problems and difficulties of its own. How, for example, is
the court to decide <em>which particular ground</em> of discrimination
ought to come within the ambit of that provision? There is every
danger that the court could end up acting like a “mini-legislature”. Indeed,
it might have <em>no choice</em> but to do
so, except, perhaps, in the clearest instances (which would, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, have the endorsement of
at least the majority of the population in that particular jurisdiction,
although there would be very real and practical difficulties in
the <em>court’s</em> ability to ascertain the
existence of such endorsement in the first place).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A brief summary of our analysis
thus far</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    A
brief summary at this juncture is apposite, but it should be read
and understood in conjunction with the detailed analysis proffered
above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
“reasonable classification” test is the applicable test in Singapore
for determining the constitutionality of a statute under Art 12(1).
It is a <em>threshold</em> test inasmuch
as a failure to satisfy it (by satisfying both Limb (a) <em>and</em> Limb (b) of the test) will result
in the statute concerned being rendered void <em>without</em> the
court even having to <em>directly</em> engage
the concept of equality as such. This is because the statute concerned
would be so illogical and/or incoherent that, <em>ex hypothesi</em>,
it cannot possibly even begin to satisfy the concept of equality
embodied in Art 12(1). To that extent, the “reasonable classification”
test contains substantive elements which impact the concept of equality
itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_b"></a>(b)     Article 12<em>(1)</em> is more declaratory and aspirational
in nature. However, as stated at sub-para (a) above, any statute
which does not satisfy the “reasonable classification” test will
necessarily be in contravention of Art 12(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_c"></a>(c)     To
the extent that both limbs of the “reasonable classification” test
embody the requirements of logic and/or coherence, it can be said that
a statute is <em>illegitimate</em> if and
to the extent that either or both of these requirements is <em>not</em> satisfied because the statute fails
to pass muster under one or both of the limbs of the “reasonable classification”
test. For the avoidance of doubt, it should be emphasised that there
is <em>no further</em> test of <em>illegitimacy</em> (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the object
of the impugned statute) for the detailed reasons set out in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_d"></a>(d)     Article 12<em>(2)</em> prohibits <em>specific</em> grounds
of discrimination, which are the <em>only</em> grounds
of discrimination that are proscribed under the Singapore Constitution.
Any discrimination (albeit only) on any of the grounds stated in
Art 12(2) will render the statute concerned void pursuant to Art 4
to the extent of the inconsistency with Art 12(2). Article 12(2)
sets out a structured and principled approach to the right to equality,
as compared to constitutional provisions in other jurisdictions
which are more open-ended and which might therefore vest too much
“legislative” power in the courts. Although only specific grounds
of discrimination are prohibited under Art 12(2), the necessary
flexibility to include additional prohibited grounds of discrimination
exists inasmuch as Art 12(2) can be amended by the Singapore Parliament
(pursuant to Art 5 of the Singapore Constitution) in order to reflect
the prevailing social mores as well as aspirations of Singapore
society at any given point in time. Whilst Art 12(2) applies only
to citizens of Singapore, non-citizens are nevertheless still accorded
protection under Art 12(1) pursuant to the “reasonable classification”
test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Let
us now turn to <em>apply</em> the principles
set out above to the facts of the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on whether s 377A
violates Art 12(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As
already mentioned earlier, the “reasonable classification” test
must necessarily be the first legal port of call. This court must
also consider whether or not the facts of the present appeals fall
(more specifically) within Art <em>12(2). However</em>,
before proceeding to examine these two issues, there is a significant
preliminary issue that needs to be considered: is there (as the Respondent
argues and, not surprisingly, the Appellants refute) a <em>presumption of constitutionality</em> where
s 377A is concerned, given the fact that it was promulgated during <em>colonial</em> times when, <em>ex
hypothesi</em>, there was (at least literally speaking) no
Constitution in existence in Singapore?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is there a presumption of constitutionality?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As
alluded to above, the Appellants argue that the Respondent cannot rely
on a presumption of constitutionality in so far as the legal status
of s 377A is concerned. In particular, they point to the fact that
s 377A was enacted at a point in time when there was <em>no Constitution </em><em>in
existence</em> in Singapore. In doing so, they draw a distinction
between laws enacted before Singapore became an independent sovereign
State on 9 August 1965 (“pre-Independence laws”) and laws enacted
thereafter (“post-Independence laws”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The
difficulty with the aforesaid distinction is that whilst there was (literally
speaking) no Constitution in existence in Singapore at the time pre-Independence
laws were promulgated, these laws nevertheless constitute part of
the corpus of Singapore law. In this regard, Art 162 of the Singapore
Constitution (“Art 162”), which provides for the continuation of existing
laws, might be usefully noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Existing laws</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>162</b>.    Subject
to this Article, all existing laws shall continue in force on and after
the commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been
brought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution
may, subject as aforesaid, be brought into force on or after its commencement,
but all such laws shall, subject to this Article, be construed as
from the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications, adaptations,
qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into
conformity with this Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Looked at in this light, it is difficult to regard pre-Independence
laws as being somehow “inferior” to post-Independence laws inasmuch
as the former were promulgated during colonial times. Whilst there
was some discussion as to whether or not Art 162 had a substantive
(as opposed to a merely technical (including linguistic)) effect
in so far as the words “modifications, adaptations, qualifications
and exceptions” were concerned, this does not detract from the fact
that pre-Independence laws do in fact constitute part of the corpus
of Singapore law. If any of these laws is alleged to be unconstitutional,
that will have to be determined (as in the present appeals) by the
courts in accordance with the relevant constitutional rules and
principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Abdullah
accepted (correctly, in our view) that whilst the presumption of
constitutionality ought to still operate even in relation to pre-Independence
laws, the presumption might not, in the nature of things, operate
as strongly as it would compared to post-Independence laws (which would
necessarily have been promulgated in the context of, <em>inter alia</em>, an elected legislature which,
it can be assumed, would have fully considered all views before
enacting the (post-Independence) laws concerned). As mentioned in
the preceding paragraph, it would, in our view, be too artificial
and too extreme to discard the presumption of constitutionality altogether
in so far as pre-Independence laws are concerned. The approach advocated
by Mr Abdullah represents a viable middle-ground which avoids throwing
out the baby together with the bathwater. Indeed, when viewed from
a practical perspective, the court, in applying the presumption
of constitutionality, will always have regard to all the circumstances
of the case (including both the relevant text <em>as
well as</em> the context of the statute concerned).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    To
summarise, whilst the presumption of constitutionality applies in the
context of the present appeals, this is subject to the precise facts
and circumstances which we shall be considering in due course. Let
us now turn to the application of the “reasonable classification”
test to s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the “reasonable
classification” test to s 377A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As
mentioned earlier at (<em>inter alia</em>)
[60] above, the “reasonable classification” test comprises two limbs,
both of which must be satisfied before the test is satisfied. To
recapitulate (albeit in the briefest of terms), Limb (a) requires
the classification prescribed by the statute concerned to be founded
on an intelligible differentia, while Limb (b) requires a rational relation
between that differentia and the object sought to be achieved by
the statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Is the classification
prescribed by s 377A based on an intelligible differentia?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As
already noted above (at [23]), the Judge held in <em>Lim
Meng Suang</em> that it was clear that the classification
prescribed by s 377A was based on an intelligible differentia inasmuch
as there was little difficulty in determining who fell within and
without the provision. In his view (see <em>Lim
Meng Suang</em> at [47]–[48]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    The
First Limb requires that the classification prescribed by the impugned
legislation must be based on an intelligible differentia. “Intelligible”
means something that may be understood or is capable of being apprehended
by the intellect or understanding, as opposed to by the senses. “Differentia”
is used in the sense of a distinguishing mark or character, some attribute
or feature by which one is distinguished from all others. Scientifically,
one talks of an attribute by which a species is distinguished from
all other species of the same genus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    Applying this to the present case,
it is quite clear that the classification prescribed by s 377A – <em>viz</em>, male homosexuals or bisexual males
who perform acts of “gross indecency” on another male – is based
on an intelligible differentia. It is also clear from the differentia
in s 377A that the section excludes male-female acts and female-female
acts. There is little difficulty identifying who falls within this
classification and who does not. The Court of Appeal seemed to say
as much in <em>Tan Eng Hong [(standing)]</em> at
[125]–[126]. In my view, the First Limb is satisfied and few can
cavil with this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    We
agree with the Judge and his reasoning as set out in the preceding paragraph.
Indeed, the intense controversy surrounding the debate on s 377A
in the extra-legal sphere in general and during the parliamentary debates
in October 2007 on proposed changes to the revised edition of the Penal
Code then in force (<em>ie</em>, the Penal
Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Penal Code”)) in particular
demonstrate that the differentia embodied in s 377A, whilst <em>controversial</em>, is <em>not
unintelligible</em>. Put simply, if the very elements of s 377A
were <em>illogical and/or incoherent to begin with,
there would have been no basis upon which the parties on each side
of this cavernous divide could have joined issue in the first place.</em> Indeed,
the controversy relates more to <em>extra-legal</em> arguments
that are relevant to the debate as well as the decision in the <em>legislative</em> sphere (on whether s 377A should
be retained in our statute books or repealed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Mr Ravi
argued that the differentia embodied in s 377A was <em>not</em> intelligible
because it was discriminatory inasmuch as it discriminated between
male homosexuals on the one hand and female homosexuals on the other.
He also utilised (as did Ms Barker), in oral arguments, the analogy
of a law banning all women from driving on the roads.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    With
respect, Mr Ravi has <em>conflated</em> the
“reasonable classification” test (in particular, the first limb
thereof, which is the focus of the present analysis) on the one
hand and the issue of whether or not there has been discrimination
on the other. Put simply, the latter issue (<em>viz</em>,
whether or not there has been discrimination) has been merged with
the first limb of the “reasonable classification” test. It will
be recalled that the “reasonable classification” test is only a <em>threshold</em> test (see above at, <em>inter alia</em>, [61]–[62]). As we have already
explained, this does not mean that the test is merely technical
or mechanistic; instead, it does, to some extent, impact the concept
of equality in Art 12 itself (see above at [62] and [71]). Indeed,
the “reasonable classification” test, in embodying the requirements
of logic and/or coherence, also introduces (to <em>that</em> extent)
a limited element of <em>legitimacy</em>,
although it has been emphasised above (at [84]–[85]) that there is <em>no further</em> test of <em>illegitimacy</em> (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the object of the impugned statute) as
such. Looked at in this light, the differentia embodied in s 377A
is both logical and coherent. Mr Ravi obviously begs to differ.
However, this difference in view is premised on <em>substantive
criteria that lie outside the scope of the “reasonable classification”
test altogether.</em> In the <em>Singapore</em> context,
these substantive criteria lie, instead, within the purview of Art 12<em>(2)</em> (see above at [92]). Put simply, contrary
to what Mr Ravi appeared to suggest, the “reasonable classification
test” is <em>not</em> the only (and definitive)
test for determining whether the right to equality under Art 12 as
a whole has been violated. This is because even if an impugned statute passes
legal muster under the “reasonable classification” test for the purposes
of Art 12(1), it will <em>also</em> have
to pass legal muster under Art 12(2). As we shall show below (at
[181]–[182]), s 377A not only passes legal muster under the “reasonable
classification” test, but <em>also</em> does <em>not</em> run foul of Art 12(2) for the simple
reason that Art 12(2) does <em>not</em> address
or encompass the subject matter of s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Similar
reasoning to that set out in the preceding paragraph would apply
to Mr Ravi’s and Ms Barker’s arguments (by analogy) with respect
to a law which bans all women from driving on the roads. We would
observe, parenthetically, that, in any event, such a law is an extreme
provision which would probably not be enacted by a reasonable Parliament
in the Singapore context. That having been said, anything is, of
course, possible. Should such a law indeed be passed by the Singapore
Parliament, there would, in our view, be at least an arguable case
that that law would not pass legal muster under the “reasonable
classification” test. The differentia embodied in that law might,
arguably, be illogical and/or incoherent for the purposes of the first
limb (<em>ie</em>, Limb (a)) of the “reasonable
classification” test. Further, as pointed out above, there is also
a second limb (<em>ie</em>, Limb (b)) of
the “reasonable classification” test which must be satisfied, Limb (a)
and Limb (b) being consecutive and <em>cumulative</em> aspects
of the test. Looked at in this light, it is at least arguable that
there might <em>not</em> be a rational relation between
the differentia embodied in the aforementioned law on the one hand
and the purpose and object of that law on the other – unless the purpose
and object of that law is precisely to ban all women from driving. However,
if that is indeed the case, we would come back full circle, so to speak,
to the issue (just mentioned) of whether or not the differentia
(as identified under the first limb of the “reasonable classification”
test) is illogical and/or incoherent. <em>No</em> such
circularity arises on the facts of the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    We
turn now to the next (and closely-related) issue of whether or not the
second limb of the “reasonable classification” test has been satisfied
on the facts of the present appeals, <em>viz</em>,
is there a rational relation between the differentia embodied in
s 377A and the purpose and object of that provision?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Is there a rational
relation between the differentia embodied in s 377A and the purpose
and object of the provision?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   What is the purpose
and object of s 377A?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Although
this particular question of the purpose and object of s 377A did
not appear to pose a problem in the court below and, indeed, before
this court (at least for the initial part of the parties’ oral submissions),
it does not – for the reasons set out below – admit of that clear
an answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(I)   The English origins
of s 377A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Section 377A
is based on s 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (c 69) (UK)
(“the 1885 UK Act”), which is more commonly known as “the Labouchere
Amendment” (as it was introduced by Mr Henry Labouchere). This court
has, in <em>Tan Eng Hong (standing)</em>,
dealt with the historical backdrop to both the UK and the local
positions in some detail. Suffice it to state that the precise origins
of s 11 of the 1885 UK Act (“the UK s 11”) are none too clear –
a point also acknowledged by the Judge in the court below (see <em>Lim Meng Suang</em> at [64]). Put briefly,
the UK s 11 was introduced at, literally, the eleventh hour, and
had nothing to do with the main thrust of the 1885 UK Act itself.
It is therefore not surprising that there was no debate in the UK
Parliament on this particular provision before enacting it. This
merely adds to the mystery surrounding its origins and, more importantly,
its purpose and object.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(II)   The introduction
of s 377A into the Straits Settlements in 1938</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    What,
then, of s 377A? Although it was (as already mentioned) based on
the UK s 11, it was introduced into our Penal Code only in 1938
– some <em>53 years after the inception of its
original counterpart in the UK.</em> The UK s 11 was introduced
into the Straits Settlements in the form of s 377A of the Penal
Code (Cap 20, 1936 Rev Ed) (“the 1936 Penal Code”) via s 3 of the Penal
Code (Amendment) Ordinance 1938 (No 12 of 1938) (“the 1938 Penal
Code Amendment Ordinance”). Whilst an immediate response might,
notwithstanding the substantial lapse of time just referred to,
be to assume that the purpose and object of s 377A was the same
as that of the UK s 11, an equally immediate problem is that the
purpose and object of the latter provision was <em>unclear
to begin with</em>. In this last-mentioned regard, it appears
that it has merely been <em>assumed</em> that
the purpose and object of the UK s 11 was <em>coterminous
with the general language contained therein</em>. This is
not the most enlightened of approaches in so far as ascertaining
the purpose and object of a statutory provision is concerned, but
it might, in the circumstances, have been the only viable way forward.
That having been said, it <em>does not logically
follow that the purpose and object of s 377A would necessarily be
the same as that of the UK s 11 – especially when we take into account
the fact (already mentioned) that s 377A was enacted some 53 years after
the latter provision.</em> Unfortunately, what <em>objective</em> evidence we have on the purpose
and object of s 377A is <em>itself unclear</em>.
Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(III)   The Attorney-General’s
speech before the Straits Settlements Legislative Council</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The
starting point is the following brief paragraph by the then Attorney-General,
Mr C G Howell (“Mr Howell”), in his speech when introducing the
Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 1938 (“the 1938 Penal Code Amendment
Bill”) in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (that Bill was
later enacted as the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance). Mr Howell
stated as follows (see <em>Proceedings of the Legislative
Council of the Straits Settlements</em> (“<em>Proceedings</em>”)
(13 June 1938) at p B49):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to clause 4 [later enacted
as s 3 of the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance, which introduced
s 377A into our Penal Code] it is <em>unfortunately
the case that </em><b>acts of the nature
described </b><em>have been brought to notice</em>. <em>As the law now stands</em>, <b><em>such
acts</em></b> can <b><em>only </em></b><em>be dealt with</em>, <em>if
at all</em>, under <b><em><u>the Minor Offences
Ordinance</u></em></b>, <em>and </em><em>then only if committed </em><b><em><u>in
public</u></em></b>. <b><em>Punishment </em></b><em>under </em><b><em>the Ordinance </em></b><em>is </em><b><em>inadequate </em></b><b><em><u>and </u></em></b><b>the chances
of detection are small</b><em>. It is desired,
therefore, to </em><b>strengthen the law </b><b><em><u>and</u></em></b> to <b><em><u>bring
it into line with the English Criminal Law</u></em></b>, <b><em><u>from which this clause is taken</u></em></b>, <b><em><u>and</u></em></b> the law of <b><em><u>various
other parts of the Colonial Empire</u></em></b> of which it is only
necessary to mention <b><em><u>Hong Kong and Gibraltar </u></em></b><b><em>where conditions are </em></b><b><em><u>somewhat similar
to our own</u></em></b>. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics
and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Whilst
Mr Howell’s statement (as quoted in the preceding paragraph) is
brief, it is (as we shall see) extremely cryptic. It is, in fact,
pregnant with meaning, and (as we shall elaborate upon below) the
difficulty lies in ascertaining the precise meaning which Mr Howell
intended. Before proceeding to do so, it is appropriate to set out
other historical documentation which might be of relevance to the
present inquiry into the purpose and object of s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(IV)   The Objects and
Reasons accompanying the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Bill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    We
turn, first, to the “Objects and Reasons” which accompanied the 1938
Penal Code Amendment Bill (“the <em>Objects and
Reasons</em>”). The material part of the <em>Objects
and Reasons</em> reads as follows (see <em>Proceedings</em> (25 April
1938) at p C81):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 4 introduces a new section <em>based on section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act 1885</em> (48 and 49 Vict. c. 69). <em>The
section makes punishable </em><b><em>acts </em></b><em>of </em><b><em>gross indecency </em></b><em>between </em><b><em>male </em></b><em>persons </em><b><em>which do
not amount to an unnatural offence within the meaning of </em></b><b><em><u>section 377 of the [1936 Penal] Code</u></em></b>.
[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(V)   Important questions
raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    At
this particular juncture, <em>an extremely important
point should be noted: whilst Mr Howell referred to the need to
supplement the Minor Offences Ordinance 1906 (No 13 of 1906)</em> (“the
1906 Minor Offences Ordinance”) <em>in his speech
to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council</em> (see above
at [119]), <em>the</em> Objects and Reasons <em>referred, instead, to the need to supplement s 377
of the 1936 Penal Code.</em> (For ease of discussion, we shall hereafter
use the term “s 377” to denote not only s 377 of the 1936 Penal Code,
but also, where appropriate to the context, its successor provisions
up to the time s 377 of the 1985 Penal Code was repealed by the
Singapore Parliament via the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51
of 2007) (“the 2007 Penal Code Amendment Act”).) Why are there references
to <em>different</em> statutes? More importantly,
is there an <em>inconsistency</em>, <em>or</em> is the inconsistency more <em>apparent</em> than real? On a related note, <em>both</em> Mr Howell’s speech to the Straits
Settlements Legislative Council (referred to hereafter as “Mr Howell’s
Legislative Council speech” where appropriate to the context) <em>as well as</em> the <em>Objects
and Reasons</em> referred to the fact that s 377A was based
on <em>English law</em> (<em>ie</em>, <em>the UK </em><em>s 11</em>).
What is the significance, if any, of this last-mentioned reference
to English law? Before attempting to answer these questions, we
shall continue to set out the rest of the historical documentation
that might be relevant to the present inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(VI)   Other relevant historical
documentation</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-7">(a)Colonial Office correspondence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    There
is Colonial Office correspondence relating to the 1938 Penal Code
Amendment Ordinance, which was sent <em>after</em> the
enactment of that Ordinance (the Ordinance was assented to by the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief on 2 July 1938 and came into effect
on 8 July 1938). The first piece of correspondence (from the UK
Public Record Office, Colonial Office Series 273) is a cover letter
dated 13 July 1938 from the Deputy of the Governor of the Straits
Settlements, the material part of which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have the honour to forward herewith Ordinance
No.12 of 1938, entitled “An Ordinance to amend the Penal Code (Chapter 20
of the Revised Edition)”, together with the Attorney-General’s certificate <em>and </em><b><em>report </em></b><em>on the Ordinance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    What
is interesting in the aforesaid cover letter is the reference to
the enclosed “<em>report</em>” [emphasis
added], which was entitled “Report on an Ordinance to amend the
Penal Code (Chapter 20 of the Revised Edition). (No. 12 of 1938)”
and dated 21 June 1938 (“the June 1938 Report”). The relevant part
of that report (relating to the introduction of s 377A) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 3 [of the 1938 Penal Code Amendment
Ordinance] introduces a new section <em>based on
section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (48 and 49 Vict.
c. 69). The section makes punishable </em><b><em>acts </em></b><em>of </em><b><em>gross indecency </em></b><em>between </em><b><em>male </em></b><em>persons </em><b><em>which do
not amount to an unnatural offence within the meaning of </em></b><b><em><u>section 377 of the [1936 Penal] Code</u></em></b>.
[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It will be noticed that the extract just quoted is <em>virtually identical</em> to the relevant part
of the <em>Objects and Reasons</em> set out
above (at [121]), and is, correspondingly, <em>different
from</em> Mr Howell’s Legislative Council speech (which refers,
instead, to the need to supplement <em>the 1906
Minor Offences Ordinance</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-7">(b)Annual Reports on the Organisation
and Administration of the Straits Settlements Police and on the
State of Crime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Of
possible relevance, too, are some extracts from the <em>Annual
Report on the Organisation and Administration of the Straits Settlements
Police and on the State of Crime</em> (“the <em>Annual
Report</em>”) for the years 1936 to 1938. In particular, reference
may be made to the <em>Annual Report</em> for
the year 1936 at para 40, where it is stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prostitutes are no longer to be found soliciting
in numbers on street parades; they find it more profitable to go
to amusement parks, cafes, dancing places and, generally speaking,
no exception can be taken to their behaviour. <em>Singapore,
a port and a town combined, is not free from the very low type of prostitute</em>.
The lewd activities of these have been sternly suppressed. <b><em>Male prostitution</em></b> was <b><em>also </em></b><em>kept in check</em>, <b><em>as
and when encountered</em></b>. [emphasis added in italics and
bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Reference
may also be made to the <em>Annual Report</em> for
the year 1937 at para 36 as well as paras 38–39, where it is stated
thus:</p>
<p align="center" class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b><em>Public
Morals</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    The Police took action to suppress
the old type of brothel (a keeper and several women) and have prevented
as far as it has been possible the establishment of the new type–two
or more women living on or available at premises rented for the
purpose of prostitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Soliciting in public was kept in check,
a difficult and unpleasant type of work and one requiring ceaseless
supervision. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38.    The
fact that the Police are not the deciding authorities in matters
of <b><em><u>public morals</u></em></b> is often overlooked.
The duty of the Police is to suppress offences. <em>Offences</em><b><em><u>against public decency</u></em></b> are defined
in the laws of the land. The presence of <b><em>prostitutes</em></b> on
the streets is no offence. <em>An offence is committed
only if</em><b><em><u>a woman persistently
solicits</u></em></b><b><em>to the annoyance of a
member of</em></b><b><em><u>the public</u></em></b><b><em>. The public have not yet come forward to give evidence
that she does so.</em></b> It would seem that in Singapore the
concourse of East and West is alone responsible for such publicity
as has been given to a state of affairs similar to that in Europe,
where it passes almost unnoticed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39.    
              <b><em>Widespread existence</em></b> of <b><em><u>male prostitution</u></em></b><b><em>was
discovered and reported to the Government whose orders have been
carried out</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A certain amount of
criticism based probably upon too little knowledge of the actual
facts, has been expressed against a policy the object of which is
to stamp out this evil.</em>
<b><em>Sodomy
is a penal offence; its danger to adolescents is obvious; obvious
too, is the danger of blackmail</em></b>, <b><em><u>the
demoralising effect on disciplined forces and</u></em></b><b><em>on</em></b><b><em><u>a mixed community
which looks to the Government for wholesome governing</u></em></b><b>.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics, bold italics
and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Finally,
reference may be made to the <em>Annual Report</em> for
the year 1938 at paras 45–48, which read as follows:</p>
<p align="center" class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<em><b><font style="font-variant: small-caps;">Public
Morals</font></b></em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45.    The duty of the Police in <em>safeguarding public morals</em> is limited
to enforcing the law. The slightest deviation from such a policy,
in this matter more than in any other, would lead to the risk of
very serious persecution or connivance. The law of the Colony is
based on the law of the United Kingdom, and that human nature is
not subject to climatic variations is well proved by a visit to,
for instance, Jermyn Street, the dock area of Southampton, or street
corners at Woolwich or Sandhurst at the recognised hours. The only
difference is to be found in the text of the law in <em>the
words </em><b><em>“persistently” solicits</em></b>.
The courts have to be satisfied on this point by evidence independent
of the Police. This evidence has not been forthcoming in the city
of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46.    
              <em>Action against
the </em>
<b><em>local brothels</em></b>
<em>–</em>
<b><em>2 women</em></b> living

of $1 make matters difficult.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    Action was taken against pimps and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48.    
              <b><em>Male prostitution </em></b>

<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(VII)   Analysis of and
decision on the purpose and object of s 377A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Let
us now return to the important questions posed above (at [122]) as
they impact directly and significantly on the crucial inquiry at
hand, <em>viz</em>, the purpose and object
of s 377A. This relates to the application of Limb (b) of the “reasonable
classification” test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It
will be recalled that one key difficulty lies in the fact that Mr Howell referred
to <em>the need to supplement </em><em>the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance</em> in his speech
to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (see above at [119]), whereas
both the <em>Objects and Reasons </em><em>as well as</em> the <em>June
1938 </em><em>Report</em> referred
to <em>the need to supplement s 377</em> (see
above at [121] and [124], respectively)<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In
so far as <em>the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance</em> was
concerned, the relevant provision was <em>s 23</em> thereof
(“s 23”), which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who is found drunk and incapable
of taking care of himself, <b><em>or</em></b> is guilty
of any riotous, disorderly <b><em><u>or indecent behaviour</u></em></b>, <b><em>or</em></b> of <b><em><u>persistently soliciting
or importuning for immoral purposes</u></em></b> in any <b><em>public</em></b> road or in any <b><em>public</em></b> place
or place of <b><em>public</em></b> amusement or
resort, or in the immediate vicinity of any Court or of any public
office or police station or place of worship, <em>shall
be liable to</em> a fine not exceeding twenty dollars, or
to imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen days, and
on a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty
dollars or to imprisonment for a term which may extend to three
months. [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined
bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Counsel
for all the Appellants relied heavily on the fact that Mr Howell
referred to the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance to argue that s 377A
was enacted in order to combat the problem of <em>male
prostitution</em>. On their argument, applying s 377A to categories <em>outside</em> the narrow category just mentioned
(<em>viz</em>, male prostitution) would be <em>over-inclusive and, hence, unconstitutional</em>.
In particular, Ms Barker pointed to the words “persistently soliciting
or importuning for immoral purposes” in s 23 as evincing an intention
on the part of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council that
s 377A (dealing as it did with male-to-male conduct) should cover
the social as well as public ill of <em>male prostitution</em>.
Whilst we see some force in this particular argument, there are
at least two difficulties with it. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The <em>first</em> difficulty relates to the fact that
s 23 contains not only the phrase “persistently soliciting or importuning
for immoral purposes”, <em>but also</em> the
(<em>more general</em>) phrase “guilty of
any … <em>indecent behaviour</em>” [emphasis
added]. That these two phrases set out <em>two
separate and distinct limbs</em> of the offence under s 23
is clear, and is confirmed by the fact that these two limbs presently
exist as <em>two separate and distinct sections</em> (<em>viz</em>, s 19 and s 20, respectively) of the
Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184,
1997 Rev Ed), the current equivalent of the 1906 Minor Offences
Ordinance. This first difficulty in fact leads us to the second difficulty,
to which it is (as we shall see in a moment) closely related. This second
difficulty lies in the fact that <em>both</em> the <em>Objects and Reasons </em><em>as
well as</em> the <em>June 1938 </em><em>Report</em> did <em>not</em> refer
to the need to supplement the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance at all,
but referred <em>instead</em> to <em>the need to supplement s 377.</em> Section 377
as it stood in 1938 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Unnatural
offences</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>377</b>.    Whoever
voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with
any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with penal servitude
for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine
or to whipping.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Explanation</em>.—Penetration
is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to
the offence described in this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    This
(<em>apparently</em>) <em>alternative</em> purpose
and object of s 377A (<em>ie</em>, to <em>supplement s 377</em>) is significant <em>because it is consistent with the other (and more
general) limb of s 23 (which, it will be recalled, relates to the proscription
of, </em>inter alia<em>, “indecent behaviour”)</em>.
Indeed, <em>this</em> particular limb of
s 23 was broader than s 377 inasmuch as it covered “indecent behaviour” that
included but was not confined to anal and/or oral sex (hereafter referred
to as “penetrative sex”); however, it was confined to <em>public</em> conduct. Hence, s 377A, which would <em>also</em> cover “grossly indecent” acts between males
in <em>private</em>, would apply to situations
which were <em>outside the purview of s 23</em>.
It is also important to note that s 377A would <em>simultaneously supplement
s 377 inasmuch as s 377A would (like s 23) cover even “grossly indecent”
acts which fell short of penetrative sex</em>. It should be
pointed out, at this juncture, that it follows that s 377A would <em>necessarily cover acts of penetrative sex as well</em>.
Any other interpretation would be illogical since it cannot be denied
that acts of penetrative sex constitute <em>the
most serious</em> instances of the possible acts of <em>“gross indecency”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    As
just mentioned, s 377A <em>broadened the scope</em> hitherto
covered by s 377 to cover not only penetrative sex but also <em>other (less serious)</em> acts of “<em>gross indecency</em>” committed between <em>males.</em> However, we would expect that prior
to our Parliament’s repeal of s 377 via the 2007 Penal Code Amendment
Act, where acts of penetrative sex were involved, the accused would
probably have been charged under s 377 as that section imposed a heavier
penalty (compared to s 377A), although the Prosecution would also have
had the option of charging the accused under s 377A instead. This
is not surprising because, as we have just observed, acts of penetrative
sex are <em>the most serious</em> instances
of the possible acts of “gross indecency”. Now that s 377 has been
repealed, there is no reason in principle why a charge under s 377A
cannot be brought in a situation involving acts of <em>penetrative</em> sex
between two males (which, as we have already noted, would, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, fall within the definition
of “any act of gross indecency” within the meaning of s 377A). We
note, however, that the current policy (as declared during the October
2007 parliamentary debates mentioned at [111] above) is for the
Prosecution to generally <em>not</em> charge
accused persons under s 377A, so the point just referred to is –
in the practical context at least – merely academic. It is, nevertheless,
an important point to make in the context of <em>the
present appeals</em>, particularly in the light of the further written
submissions which Ms Barker tendered on behalf of her clients (and which
are dealt with below at [144]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Returning
to the comparison between s 377A and s 23, s 377A was, as we mentioned
above at [133], <em>broader in scope </em><em>than s 23</em> inasmuch as s 377A covered “grossly
indecent” acts between males in <em>private as
well</em>. Such an analysis would explain why Mr Howell referred
to the need to supplement <em>the 1906 Minor Offences
Ordinance</em> in his speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative
Council (see above at [119]), and is in fact supported by the reference
by Mr Howell himself (<em>in the same speech</em>)
to the need to capture acts which were committed in <em>private</em> as
well (which acts, he pointed out, were not captured by the 1906
Minor Offences Ordinance as s 23 <em>only covered</em> acts
committed in <em>public</em>). It would <em>also</em> explain why Mr Howell further referred
(as, indeed, did the <em>Objects and Reasons</em> as
well as the June 1938 Report) to the fact that s 377A was based
on <em>English law – specifically, on the UK s 11</em>,
which (despite the lack of clarity as to its precise origins) has always
been perceived as a provision having <em>general</em> application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    We
think that the analysis just set out is the most persuasive because
it resolves what appears to be an inconsistency (or even a contradiction) between
Mr Howell’s Legislative Council speech (see above at [119]) on the one
hand and the <em>Objects and Reasons</em> as
well as the June 1938 Report (see above at [121] and [124], respectively)
on the other. But, if that be the case (<em>ie</em>,
if s 377A was indeed meant to <em>supplement </em><em>s 377</em>), it would then follow that s 377A
itself ought to be given <em>the same general application</em> as
s 377, and – <em>contrary</em> to the Appellants’
argument – <em>should not</em> be confined
only to male prostitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    That <em>s 377</em> was intended to be of <em>general</em> application is clear from the language
as well as the historical context of that provision. The language itself
is self-explanatory. In so far as the historical context of <em>s 377</em> is concerned, it consisted (originally)
of two provisions which were worded quite differently. They were
clauses 361 and 362 of the original draft Indian Penal Code submitted
by the then Indian Law Commission (headed by Lord Macaulay) to the
then Governor-General of India in Council, Lord Auckland, in 1837.
These clauses read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<em>OF UNNATURAL
OFFENCES</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">361.  Whoever, intending to gratify unnatural
lust, touches, for that purpose, any person, or any animal, or is
by his own consent touched by any person, for the purpose of gratifying
unnatural lust, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to fourteen years and must not be less
than two years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">362.  Whoever, intending to gratify unnatural
lust, touches for that purpose any person without that person’s
free and intelligent consent, shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may extend to life and must
not be less than seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    That
the clauses just quoted in the preceding paragraph (as well as the “successor”
provision embodied in s 377) were intended not only to be of <em>general</em> application, but <em>also
(and more importantly) to enforce societal morality is clearly evidenced

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In <em>contrast</em>, if the Appellants’ analysis
of the purpose and object of s 377A (<em>ie</em>,
that the provision was <em>only</em> intended
to deal with <em>male prostitution</em>)
were adopted, there would necessarily be an inconsistency (or even
a contradiction) between the purpose and object alleged by the Appellants
and the purpose (mentioned in the preceding paragraph) of guarding
against “injury … to the morals of the community”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Indeed,
after s 377A was introduced into the Straits Settlements via s 3 of
the 1938 Penal Code Amendment Ordinance, <em>both</em> s 377 <em>and</em> s 377A were listed under <em>the broad and general heading “Unnatural Offences”</em> (see also,
to this effect, the relevant heading and provisions in the Penal
Code (Cap 119, 1955 Rev Ed)). This clearly militates <em>against</em> the <em>very
specific</em> purpose and object canvassed by the Appellants <em>vis-à-vis</em> s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    It
should also be noted that the relevant historical documents (see above
at [121] and [124]) refer to “<em>acts</em> of <em>gross indecency</em> between <em>male</em> persons”
[emphasis added] in a <em>general</em> sense,
which again militates against the narrow approach advocated by the
Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    What,
then, about the references to <em>male prostitution</em> in
the various volumes of the <em>Annual Report</em> cited
above (at [125]–[127])? If one looks at the plain language of s 377A
(reproduced above at [3] and [56]), it is clear that the provision
would not only capture “grossly indecent” acts between males in
a <em>general</em> sense, but would <em>also necessarily capture</em> (in an <em>a fortiori</em> manner) the (relatively) more <em>specific</em> acts relating to male prostitution, including
procurement as well as abetment by third-party pimps. It should also
be noted that both the <em>Annual Report</em> for
the year 1937 and the <em>Annual Report</em> for
the year 1938 (at paras 38 and 45, respectively) referred to the problem
of “persistently soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes” in
the context of <em>female</em> – as opposed
to male – prostitution. More importantly, perhaps, the <em>Annual Report</em> for the year 1937 and the <em>Annual </em><em>Report</em> for
the year 1938 both referred (at paras 38 and 45, respectively) to the
need for the Police to safeguard “<em>public morals</em>”
[emphasis added] in a <em>general</em> sense
(as opposed to in the context of male prostitution specifically). Indeed,
the phrase “public morals” constitutes the <em>heading</em> of
the relevant part of the respective <em>Annual
Reports</em> mentioned above. This is, of course, wholly consistent
with the Respondent’s arguments on the purpose and object of s 377A
in the present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    For
the reasons set out above, we are of the view that the available objective
evidence demonstrates that s 377A was intended to be of <em>general</em> application, and was not intended
to be merely confined only (or even mainly) to the specific problem
of male prostitution (notwithstanding the fact that this would be
covered as well).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    As
mentioned above at [134], Ms Barker (with the leave of this court) tendered
further written submissions on behalf of her clients after the oral hearing
before us had concluded. In essence, she argued, first, that the phrase
“gross indecency” in s 377A did <em>not</em> cover <em>penetrative</em> sex and conduct which amounted
to an “unnatural offence” under s 377. She argued that s 377A was
intended, instead, to cover <em>other</em> acts
of “gross indecency” <em>apart from</em> acts
of <em>penetrative</em> sex, and that this
was the meaning to be attributed to Mr Howell’s Legislative Council
speech (reproduced above at [119]) with regard to the ambit of s 377A.
Ms Barker then proceeded to argue, secondly, that the original purpose
of s 377A was to <em>suppress male prostitution.</em> To
support this particular argument, she cited not only the historical
materials already referred to earlier in this judgment, but also
further materials relating to the suppression of prostitution and brothels
in the Straits Settlements. In addition, she referred to materials demonstrating
that in the <em>English</em> context, the
prosecution of the famous author, Oscar Wilde, under the UK s 11
had been pursuant to his sexual activity with persons who were,
in effect at least, male prostitutes. In this connection, we note
that Mr Ravi similarly tendered further written submissions which
adopted Ms Barker’s arguments as stated above. Mr Ravi also advanced
arguments based on executive estoppel and doubtful penalisation
which were largely premised on Ms Barker’s arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    With
respect, we are unable to accept either Ms Barker’s or Mr Ravi’s arguments.
Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In
so far as Ms Barker’s first argument is concerned, we have already explained
above (at [133]) why the phrase “gross indecency” in s 377A must necessarily
cover penetrative sex as well. Indeed, it must surely be the case that <em>male prostitution</em> might – and, in most
cases, probably would – involve <em>penetrative</em> sex
(although, conceivably, <em>other</em> acts
of “gross indecency” could also be involved). On this logical and
commonsensical ground alone, the first argument by Ms Barker at
[144] above does not, with respect, ring true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In
so far as Ms Barker’s second argument at [144] above is concerned, the
additional historical materials proffered to this court (which included the
observations by Ms Nicoll-Jones in “Report on the Investigation
of the Problem of Prostitution in Singapore” covering the period
from May 1940 to May 1941) are, at best, neutral. They referred
to the suppression of prostitution and brothels <em>generally</em>.
Moreover, their focus (as also alluded to above at [142]) was on <em>female</em> (as opposed to male) prostitution.
We further note the Respondent’s argument in its supplemental written
case that, in any event, the references to Ms Nicoll-Jones’ observations
are irrelevant in so far as those observations were made <em>after</em> the enactment of s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In
so far as Ms Barker’s reference to the trial of Oscar Wilde is concerned,
the argument is, again, neutral, at best. As the Respondent pointed
out in its supplemental written case, Wilde was also charged under the
UK s 11 for engaging in sexual activity with men who were <em>not</em> male prostitutes, and he was acquitted
in those instances <em>not</em> because the
men concerned were not male prostitutes, but rather, because the
Prosecution did not succeed in proving the ingredients of the offence.
In any event, it <em>does not necessarily follow</em> from
the fact that Wilde might have been convicted under the UK s 11
for sexual activity with persons who were, in effect at least, male
prostitutes that this particular provision was <em>not</em> intended
to cover <em>more general situations as well</em>.
Indeed, the position is precisely the converse: put simply, if the
UK s 11 covered <em>all</em> situations relating
to “acts of gross indecency” between males, <em>it
would follow that similar situations involving male prostitutes
would also be covered on an</em> a fortiori <em>basis</em>.
In this regard, there is nothing in the legislative background surrounding
the UK s 11 which suggests otherwise. Further (and more importantly),
the legislative background surrounding s 377A, which has already
been set out in detail above, militates against the interpretation proffered
by Ms Barker on behalf of her clients. For the same reasons, Mr Ravi’s
arguments fall away as they were premised on the very same arguments
that Ms Barker advanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    We
also note that if the purpose and object of s 377A had been so specific
as to only or mainly target the problem of male prostitution, it would
have been open to Mr Howell to have been much clearer (and, more importantly,
more specific). He spoke, instead, in far more <em>general</em> terms
in his speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (see
above at [119]). We also note that given the <em>specificity</em> of
the purpose and object argued for by the Appellants, it might have
been more direct and more relevant for the Straits Settlements Legislative
Council to have simply amended the 1906 Minor Offences Ordinance
instead (which, of course, was not the measure taken by the Straits
Settlements Legislative Council in 1938).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(VIII)   A comparative
perspective?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In
his speech to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, Mr Howell referred, <em>inter alia</em>, to the respective situations
in Gibraltar and Hong Kong. Unfortunately, what evidence was available
before this court as to the situation in those two jurisdictions
at that point in time was not particularly helpful. Indeed, there
appears to be no real historical evidence with regard to the situation
in Gibraltar at the material time (although we note that Gibraltar’s
equivalent of s 377A was abolished <em>legislatively</em> in
1993).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In
so far as the situation in Hong Kong was concerned, Hong Kong’s equivalent
of s 377A was enacted as s 2 of the Hong Kong Criminal Law Amendment
Ordinance 1901 (No 3 of 1901). That was done some 37 years prior
to the introduction of s 377A into the Straits Settlements. In the “<em>Objects and Reasons</em>” accompanying the
Criminal Law Amendment Bill 1901 (HK), the then Attorney-General,
Mr W Meigh Goodman, stated as follows (see the <em>Hongkong
Government Gazette</em> (1 February 1901) at p 170):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 2 of this Ordinance extends to
this Colony the provisions of section eleven of the English Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1885. When the various sections of Part I of
that Act which is headed “Protection of Women and Girls” were considered
with a view to their being embodied in our local legislation relating
to that subject, section eleven which is out of place in Part I
of the English Act was omitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Unfortunately,
the statement quoted in the preceding paragraph does not aid us
in ascertaining what precisely was the purpose and object of Hong
Kong’s equivalent of s 377A. Indeed, the above statement is somewhat
ambiguous and (at best) merely repeats what the (literal) situation
in Hong Kong was at the time the 1885 UK Act was promulgated. We
should also observe that Hong Kong (like Gibraltar) abolished its equivalent
of s 377A <em>legislatively</em> in 1991.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Is the “rational
relation” requirement satisfied?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    For
the purposes of the second limb (<em>ie</em>,
Limb (b)) of the “reasonable classification” test, we agree with
the Judge that there is a rational relation between the differentia
embodied in s 377A and the purpose and object of the provision as
set out above. Indeed, given our findings with respect to the two
limbs of the “reasonable classification” test, we hold (as did the
Judge) that there is, in fact, <em>a complete coincidence</em> in
the relation between that differentia and that purpose and object.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issue of illegitimacy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As
already stated earlier in this judgment, there is <em>no
separate or independent test of illegitimacy</em> (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the object of the impugned statute) for
the purposes of ascertaining the constitutionality of that statute
under Art 12. There is therefore no need for us to consider the
issue of illegitimacy in relation to the facts and circumstances
of the present appeals, given our finding (applying the “reasonable
classification” test to s 377A) that there is no illogicality or
incoherence in the differentia embodied in that provision. It is
important to reiterate that the courts cannot become “mini-legislatures”.
That would be an illegitimate use of their powers. Indeed, the present
appeals illustrate precisely the dangers of adopting such an approach.
To elaborate, we have already referred above (at [111]) to the intense
controversy surrounding the debate on s 377A in the extra-legal sphere
in general and during the October 2007 parliamentary debates mentioned
in that same paragraph in particular. This controversy has been marked
on both sides of a very stark (and often emotional) divide by a
great number of <em>extra-legal</em> arguments
which are clearly and wholly outside the remit of the courts, and
which fall instead within the purview of the legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The status and role of extra-legal
arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    We
turn now to consider the status and role of the aforementioned <em>extra-legal</em> arguments, a number of which
were made by the parties in both their written as well as their
oral submissions before this court. In our view, these arguments
are (as already mentioned) clearly <em>neither</em> relevant <em>nor</em> material in so far as the application
of the “reasonable classification” test is concerned. Neither are
they relevant in so far as the application of Art 12<em>(2)</em> is
concerned. What, then, <em>would</em> be
the relevance (if any) of these arguments? In order to answer this
more general question, it would be useful, in our view, to consider
the specific extra-legal arguments which were made in the context
of the present appeals. We should, however, emphasise that in doing
so, we are <em>not</em> in any way taking
these extra-legal arguments into account for the purposes of our
decision on the legal issues set out above at [41] <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
constitutionality of s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In
our view, whilst many of the Appellants’ extra-legal arguments are valid
(or, at least, plausible) ones, they are not arguments that may
be appropriately considered by the court and are thus <em>legally irrelevant</em>. Put simply, the court
is <em>not the appropriate forum</em> in
which to canvass such arguments; the appropriate forum in this regard
is, instead, <em>the legislature</em>. We
shall demonstrate this with reference to each of the extra-legal arguments
proffered to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The “tyranny of the
majority”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    One
of the extra-legal arguments canvassed by the Appellants was that
s 377A represented the “tyranny of the <em>majority</em>” <em>vis-à-vis</em> persons who were in the Appellants’
shoes (and who were in the <em>minority</em>).
The right to equality under Art 12(1) constituted, so the argument
went, the Appellants’ legal bulwark against the aforementioned “tyranny
of the majority”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In
our view, this particular argument, whilst attractive at first blush, consists
more of rhetoric than of substance. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    First,
the argument raises a centuries-old philosophical conundrum to which,
to the best of our knowledge, there has (despite the vast amounts
of ink that have been spilt on this particular subject) hitherto
been no satisfactory solution. Put simply, ought majoritarian rights
always to trump minority rights? If not, when should the latter
trump the former? In our view, invoking the phrase “tyranny of the
majority”, <em>without more</em>, does not address
these questions in a practical (nor, for that matter, in a theoretical) manner.
Indeed, the majority could turn the argument just mentioned on its
head and contend that likewise, they ought not to be subject to
the “tyranny of the <em>minority</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Secondly,
and turning to a more practical point, what the minority (in this
case, the Appellants) have to demonstrate to make out their argument is
that there is <em>a legal basis</em> for
claiming that their rights should trump those of the majority. <em>However, this brings us back full circle to the interpretation as
well as the application of Art 12(1) and Art 12(2) which we have
already undertaken above</em>. Any other (and broader) argument
would not be one that the court can legitimately address. If at
all, such other arguments should be addressed by <em>the
legislature</em> instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    We
should, however, observe, in fairness to the Appellants, that perhaps,
their reliance on the argument that there should be no “tyranny
of the majority” could <em>also</em> be grounded
in the (related) argument that it would be wrong for <em>the majority</em> to enforce (through s 377A) <em>societal morality</em> to the detriment of
the <em>individual rights</em> of <em>the minority</em>. This last-mentioned argument
will be dealt with below at [162]–[174] in the course of considering
the Appellants’ argument based on the absence of harm, to which
we now turn our attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The argument based
on the absence of harm (and societal morality revisited)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The
Appellants’ argument based on the absence of harm was that their
sexual conduct caused no harm to others. This particular argument was,
of course, part of the broader jurisprudential debate on the enforcement
of morals between Lord Devlin on the one hand (see generally Patrick
Devlin, <em>The Enforcement of Morals</em> (Oxford
University Press, 1963) (“<em>The Enforcement of
Morals</em>”)) and Prof H L A Hart on the other (see H L A Hart, <em>Law, Liberty and Morality</em> (Oxford University
Press, 1963) as well as, by the same author, <em>The
Morality of the Criminal Law: Two Lectures</em> (Magnes Press,
Hebrew University, 1964) (the two lectures mentioned in the title
of this particular work were the Harry Camp Lectures delivered at Stanford
University and the Lionel Cohen Lectures delivered at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem, respectively)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    The
aforesaid debate stemmed from Lord Devlin’s famous Maccabaean Lecture
in Jurisprudence entitled “The Enforcement of Morals” (1959) 45 Proceedings
of the British Academy 129, which was delivered on 18 March 1959
at the British Academy and which was reprinted in the book with
the same title (mentioned above) (the lecture constituted the first
chapter of that work, albeit with the new title “Morals and the
Criminal Law”). What is interesting in the context of the present appeals
is that this particular lecture by Lord Devlin was prompted by the views
expressed in the <em>Report of the Departmental
Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution</em> (HMSO,
Cmnd 247, 1957), more popularly known as “The Wolfenden Report”
(after the chairman of that committee, Sir John Wolfenden) and hereafter
referred to as “<em>The Wolfenden Report</em>”.
Paragraph 61 of <em>The Wolfenden Report</em> states
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… We have outlined the arguments against
a change in the law, and we recognise their weight. We believe,
however, that they have been met by the counter-arguments we have
already advanced. There remains one additional counter-argument
which we believe to be decisive, namely, the importance which society
and the law ought to give to individual freedom of choice and action
in matters of private morality. <em>Unless a deliberate
attempt is to be made by society, acting through the agency of the
law, to equate the sphere of crime with that of sin, there must
remain a realm of private morality and immorality which is, in brief
and crude terms, not the law’s business.</em> To say this
is not to condone or encourage private immorality. On the contrary,
to emphasise the personal and private nature of moral or immoral
conduct is to emphasise the personal and private responsibility
of the individual for his own actions, and that is a responsibility
which a mature agent can properly be expected to carry for himself
without the threat of punishment from the law. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Briefly
stated, Lord Devlin was of the view – contrary to that expressed
in <em>The Wolfenden Report –</em> that <em>the law </em><em>could</em> regulate
as well as sanction <em>private</em> acts
in order to preserve the moral fabric of society. In setting out
his views, Lord Devlin proceeded, <em>inter alia</em>,
on the premise that <em>there was a societal morality
that could constitute the basis upon which private conduct could
be regulated and sanctioned by means of the law. This is, in fact,
akin to the approach adopted by the Respondent in the present appeals.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Prof Hart,
on the other hand, disagreed with this view. Indeed, although Prof Hart’s
best known works are those cited above (at [162]), he in fact pointed
to an earlier article (<em>viz</em>, H L A Hart,
“Immorality and Treason” <em>The Listener</em> (30 July
1959) at pp 162–163) as being not only “one of [his] better [articles]”,
but also the piece that catalysed the entire debate; in Prof Hart’s
own words, the article “attacked Devlin. He was horrified. [So]
he [published] a whole book [<em>viz</em>, <em>The Enforcement of Morals</em>] in reply to
it” (see “Hart Interviewed: H.L.A. Hart in Conversation with David Sugarman”
(2005) 32 Journal of Law and Society 267 at p 284). Put simply, Prof Hart
agreed with the views expressed in <em>The Wolfenden
Report</em>. In doing so, he was, <em>in </em><em>contrast to </em><em>Lord Devlin</em>,
proceeding, <em>inter alia</em>, on the premise
that <em>the individual liberty of each person
was </em><em>inviolate, such that societal
morality </em><em>could not be utilised as
a justification for regulating and sanctioning private conduct –
except to the (limited) extent (as we shall elaborate upon briefly
below) that harm would otherwise result to others. This is, in fact,
akin to the approach adopted by the Appellants in the present appeals.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Ideas
and arguments do not exist in an intellectual vacuum. Not surprisingly,
therefore, both Lord Devlin and Prof Hart relied upon works of prior
authors in support of their respective views. Lord Devlin’s views
are consistent with those of the famous Victorian jurist and judge,
James Fitzjames Stephen (see James Fitzjames Stephen QC, <em>Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</em> (Smith Elder,
&amp; Co, 2nd Ed, 1874; reprinted, The University of Chicago Press,
1991) (“<em>Stephen</em>”); see also the
preface to <em>The Enforcement of Morals</em> at
p vii), whilst Prof Hart’s views are consistent with those of the famous
British philosopher, civil servant and Member of Parliament, John Stuart
Mill (see J S Mill, <em>On Liberty</em> (John W Parker
and Son, 1859; reprinted with Editing as well as an Introduction
by Gertrude Himmelfarb in Pelican Books, 1974) (“<em>Mill</em>”)),
whose views were (not surprisingly) the subject of vigorous challenge
in <em>Stephen</em>. So the debate between
Lord Devlin and Prof Hart was an important debate with weighty protagonists
on both sides (including their predecessors).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    As
already alluded to above (at [164]), a close analysis of the approach adopted
by <em>the Respondent</em> in the present
appeals will demonstrate that it is essentially relying upon the
approach adopted by <em>Lord Devlin</em>.
In particular, Mr Abdullah focused not a few times upon the argument
that s 377A gave effect to public morality. Further, Mr Abdullah
submitted that that public morality was one which was determined
by <em>the legislature</em> to exist, and
such determination was uniquely within the purview of that institution.
Any <em>change</em> (including, presumably,
the repeal of s 377A) <em>therefore lay within
the province of the legislature – and the legislature alone</em>.
We pause to observe, parenthetically, that the use of the phrase
“<em>public</em> morality” ought to be contrasted
with the use of the phrase “<em>popular</em> morality”
as the latter might engender <em>unnecessarily
negative</em> psychological (as well as other) perceptions.
To avoid any possible misunderstanding whatsoever, we shall henceforth
utilise (and, in fact, have already utilised) the phrase “societal morality”
instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The
Appellants, in contrast, are obviously relying on the views of both Prof Hart
as well as J S Mill. In particular, Mill enunciated the famous “harm
principle” as follows (see <em>Mill</em> at
pp 68–69):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The object of this essay is to assert one
very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings
of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control,
whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties
or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is that <em>the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually
or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any
of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which
power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized
community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.</em> His
own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.
He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will
be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because,
in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right.
These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning
with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling
him or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify
that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be
calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the
conduct of anyone for which he is amenable to society is that which
concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his
independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body
and mind, the individual is sovereign. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Turning,
first, to the general debate between Lord Devlin and Prof Hart,
the arguments on each side of the philosophical divide are, as mentioned
above at [166], weighty ones. What is more important is that given
those circumstances and given the nature of the arguments themselves,
there are no clear answers – not even at a theoretical level and, <em>a fortiori</em>, not at a practical one. This
is not surprising. Interesting as these issues are as a matter of
jurisprudence and legal philosophy, they are issues that lie quintessentially
within the sphere of <em>the legislature</em>.
The balancing of rights on a broad philosophical basis is not a
task that the court can – or ought to – undertake. In particular,
the Appellants’ reliance in these proceedings on the “harm principle”
enunciated by Mill raises the very pertinent issue of what constitutes
“harm” in the first place. It is not – as appears to be the implicit
assumption of the Appellants – necessarily confined only to <em>physical</em> harm. But, if not, how far should
the ambit of “harm” extend? A moment’s reflection will reveal that
the answers to this as well as other related questions lie quintessentially
within the sphere of <em>the legislature.</em> This
point – already made several times in the course of this judgment
– cannot be emphasised too much. Hence, the Appellants’ argument
based on the absence of harm, when examined more closely, reveals
itself to be, in substance if not in form, one which ought (if at
all) to be considered by <em>the legislature</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    
          <em>As, if not more, importantly, a fundamental difference
between the approach adopted by the Respondent on the one hand and
that adopted by the Appellants on the other lies (as explained above)
in the fact that whilst the Respondent is of the view that it is
(</em>pace <em>Lord Devlin) appropriate (and, indeed,
legitimate) for the legislature to enforce societal morality through s 377A,
the Appellants are of the (diametrically opposed) </em><em>view that it is (</em>pace <em>Prof Hart)
inappropriate for the legislature to do so, except to the extent
that harm has resulted (or might result) </em><em>to
others.</em> To recapitulate, it will be recalled (see above
at [167]) that one of the premises underlying <em>the Respondent’s</em> approach
is that it is appropriate and legitimate for <em>the legislature</em> to
ascertain <em>what the prevailing societal morality
is, and to decide whether or not (in the context of these proceedings)
s 377A ought to be repealed or retained in view of that societal
morality</em>. As already noted above (at [29]–[30] and [33]–[34]), <em>the Appellants</em> are of the view that such
an approach <em>simply discriminates against</em> them <em>and deprives them of their fundamental rights</em>,
and as a result, s 377A is unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    In
our view, there is much force in the Respondent’s argument as just set
out in the preceding paragraph. The legislature is an elected body
and thus has the mandate from the electorate to promulgate laws
which reflect as well as preserve societal morality. Whilst it might
(as is the situation in the present proceedings) be difficult to
ascertain what the prevailing societal morality on a particular
issue is at any given point in time, it is still <em>the
legislature’s task</em> to make this determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    As
we understand the Appellants’ arguments, even if the prevailing societal
morality can be ascertained, giving effect to it through the law
(in this case, s 377A) would be a violation of <em>the
minority’s constitutional rights</em> as it would constitute
the “tyranny of the <em>majority</em>”. <em>However</em>, as we have already noted above
(at [159]), this argument is <em>a double-edged
one</em>, for it can <em>equally</em> be
argued by the majority that there should be no “tyranny of the <em>minority</em>”. We hasten to add that this
is <em>not</em> to endorse the approach that <em>the </em><em>majority </em><em>must always prevail.</em> Rather, this brings
us back to the protections embodied in the Articles on fundamental
rights in the Singapore Constitution – of which Art 9 and Art 12
are the focus of the present appeals. <em>The Appellants
must therefore seek to bring their respective cases within the ambit
of these two Articles.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Put
simply, Art 9 and Art 12 would constitute a <em>legal</em> basis
on which the Appellants can seek to vindicate their rights. The
Appellants <em>cannot</em> ask the court
to vindicate their rights based simply – and <em>without
more</em> – on the argument that <em>they
feel that the prevailing societal morality is wrong as it deprives
them of their freedom</em>. This is <em>not</em> to
state that such an argument cannot be made. But, a moment’s reflection
will reveal that in order to succeed in this argument, the Appellants
will necessarily need to bring to bear a great number of <em>extra-legal arguments</em>, which, as we have
already emphasised, are <em>uniquely</em> within
the purview of <em>the legislature</em>.
These extra-legal arguments include <em>empirical
data in the form of, </em>inter alia<em>,
surveys</em> (some of which were referred to by both the Appellants
and the Respondent in the course of the present appeals) <em>which this court is not equipped to assess</em>.
At this particular juncture, the vitally important distinction between the
judicial function on the one hand and the legislative function on
the other must be emphasised yet again. Put simply, the court <em>cannot and must not attempt to (still less actually)
operate as a “mini-legislature”</em> – lest the vital role
of the court as an independent and neutral institution deciding objectively,
on the basis of objective legal rules and principles, the rights which
parties have in a particular situation (among other issues) be reduced to
naught.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Indeed
(and consistent with the observations just made), it is also highly
significant, in our view, to note that <em>The
Wolfenden Report</em>, which (as we mentioned above at [163])
was the effective catalyst of the jurisprudential debate between
Lord Devlin and Prof Hart, ultimately led (albeit only a decade
later) to <em>legislative</em> action on
the part of <em>the UK Parliament</em> (in
the form of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 (c 60) (UK), which, <em>inter alia</em>, abolished the UK equivalent
of s 377A).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Let
us now turn to yet another <em>extra-legal</em> argument
which the Appellants proffered to this court, <em>viz</em>,
the argument based on immutability and/or the intractable difficulty
of change on the part of male homosexuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The argument based
on immutability and/or the intractable difficulty of change</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Put
simply, the Appellants’ argument based on immutability and/or the
intractable difficulty of change on the part of male homosexuals
was this: if the Appellants’ sexual orientation was biologically
determined, they ought not to be discriminated against via s 377A.
In particular, Mr Ravi submitted that there was overwhelming evidence
supporting the proposition that a person’s sexual orientation was
biologically determined. This is primarily a <em>scientific </em><em>and extra-legal</em> argument which, again,
is <em>outside</em> the purview of the court.
We agree with the Judge (see <em>Tan Eng Hong (substantive)</em> at
[63]) that the scientific evidence on this particular issue is –
contrary to what Mr Ravi submitted – unclear inasmuch as there is <em>no definitive evidence</em> pointing clearly
to one side of the divide or the other. <em>In
any event</em>, as just mentioned, the court is <em>not</em> in a position to arrive at a conclusive
determination on this issue. Again, this argument should – if at
all – be addressed by <em>the legislature</em> instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The safeguarding
of public health</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    It
should be noted that the Respondent, in its case before this court
(<em>cf</em> its case in the court below
(see above at [21])), did <em>not</em> rely
upon the safeguarding of public health. This was, in our view, the
correct approach simply because, once again, the court is <em>not</em> in a position to arrive at a conclusive
determination in this particular regard. That having been said, we
hasten to add that this is by no means an inappropriate argument,
but it should – if at all – be addressed by <em>the
legislature</em> instead as it raises what are clearly <em>extra-legal (in this instance, medical as well as
scientific)</em> issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Summary of our discussion
of the Appellants’ extra-legal arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The
underlying thread of our discussion at [157]–[177] above is clear and
may be stated simply: all the arguments referred to in those paragraphs are
extra-legal arguments that, whilst not necessarily unpersuasive,
ought nevertheless to be raised in the appropriate forum, which
is the legislature. Correlatively, the court is not the appropriate
forum to consider such arguments. As emphasised right at the outset
of this judgment, <em>only relevant </em><em>legal</em> arguments can (and should) be considered
by the court. It is also important to emphasise that the Appellants
are <em>not</em> thereby deprived of the opportunity
to proffer the <em>extra-legal</em> arguments
they have raised, but they have to do so at a <em>different</em> forum, <em>viz</em>, before <em>the legislature</em>.
At this juncture, it is appropriate to note the following perceptive
observations by Lord Reid in the extra-judicial lecture referred
to above at [78] (see <em>The Judge As Law Maker</em> at
p 23):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now let me come to the real difficulty
about judges making law. <em>Everyone agrees that </em><b><em>impartiality is the first essential in any judge</em></b><em>. And that means not only that he must not appear
to favour either party. </em><b><em><u>It also
means that he must not take sides on political issues</u></em></b><b><em>. When public opinion is sharply divided on any
question – whether or not the division is on party lines – no judge
ought in my view to lean to one side or the other if that can possibly
be avoided. </em></b><em>But sometimes we get
a case where that is very difficult to avoid. Then I think we must
play safe. </em><b><em>We must decide the case
on the preponderance of existing authority. </em></b><b><em><u>Parliament is the right place to settle issues
which the ordinary man re­gards as controversial.</u></em></b> On
many questions he will say: “That is the lawyers’ job, let them
get on with it.” But on others he will say: “I ought to have my
say in this. I am not going to accept dictation from the lawyers.”
… [emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    On
a related note, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, quoting from Lord Reid’s
aforesaid lecture, classified the situation where “public opinion is
sharply divided on [a] question” as a situation “[w]here the question involves
an issue of current social policy on which there is no consensus within
the community” (see Tom Bingham, “The Judge as Lawmaker: An English
Perspective” in <em>The Business of Judging: Selected
Essays and Speeches</em> (Oxford University Press, 2000) ch 2
at p 31), and stated that judges should, consequently, refrain from
making new law in such a situation. Lord Bingham also referred (at
p 32 of the same work) to another situation where, in his view,
judges ought to refrain from making new law, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the issue arises in a field far
removed from ordinary judicial experience. This is really another
way of saying that <em>whereas the Judges may properly
mould what is sometimes called lawyers’ law</em>,<b><em>they should be very slow to lay down far-reaching
rules in fields outside their experience. They should be alert to
recognize their own limitations.</em></b> [emphasis added in italics
and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Indeed,
our legislature can, apart from actually abolishing s 377A, also effect
solutions which are clearly beyond the powers of the court. For example,
Ms Barker strongly urged this court (as a possible alternative)
to at least delete the words “or private” in s 377A, hence “reading
down” s 377A to that extent (see the paragraphs of Lim and Chee’s
Appellants’ Case which we referred to above at [19]). However, consistent
with the analysis set out above, this proposed solution is clearly
outside the powers of this court, although it is an approach which
can be taken by our Parliament (if it is so persuaded).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our ruling on the constitutionality
of s 377A under Art 12(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    For
the reasons set out above, we are of the view that s 377A satisfies both
limbs of the “reasonable classification” test. It therefore passes
legal muster pursuant to Art 12<em>(1)</em>.
However, that is not the end of the matter. Consistent with the
applicable principles set out earlier in this judgment, and given
that a challenge was also mounted to the constitutionality of s 377A
under Art 12<em>(2)</em>, it is now necessary
for us to proceed to consider a further – and more specific – issue:
although s 377A does not violate Art 12(1), does it nevertheless
fall within the scope of Art 12<em>(2)</em>,
and if so, does it violate that provision?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether s 377A falls within
the scope of Art 12(2), and if so, whether it violates that provision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    It
is clear, in our view, that s 377A does <em>not</em> violate
Art 12(2) for the simple reason that it does <em>not</em> even
fall within the scope of Art 12(2) to begin with. As we have already
noted (see above at [92]), the words “gender”, “sex” and “sexual
orientation” are noticeably absent from Art 12(2). When viewed from
a historical context, this is not surprising. In particular, para 33
of the 1966 Report furnishes us with more than a hint as to why
Art 12<em>(2)</em> was drafted the way it
was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Paragraph 33
of the 1966 Report reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We consider, having regard to <em>the </em><b><em>multi-racial</em></b>,<b><em>multi-cultural</em></b>,<b><em>multi-lingual </em></b><em>and </em><b><em>multi-religious </em></b><em>composition of the population of Singapore and of
its citizens</em>, that <b><em><u>the recommendations
we have outlined in the preceding paragraph</u></em></b> will <em>not only form </em><b><em>an
impregnable shield against racial communalism and religious bigotry
as well as an effective weapon to wipe away any fears the minorities
may harbour concerning discriminatory treatment </em></b><em>but will </em><b><em>also lay
a firm and lasting foundation on which to build a democratic, equal
and just multi-racial society in Singapore</em></b>. We accordingly recommend
that the present Article 8 [the then Malaysian equivalent of our Art 12]
should be deleted and in its place we recommend the following two Articles:
—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">8<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">a</font>. All
persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection
of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">8<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</font>. (1) Except
as expressly authorised by this Constitution and subject to the
provisions of this Article —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(<em>a</em>) no
law shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself
or in its effect; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(<em>b</em>) no
persons shall be treated in a discriminatory manner by any person
acting by virtue of any written law or in the performance of the
functions of any public office or any public authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(2) In this Article, the expression “discriminatory”
means affording different treatment to different persons attributable
wholly or mainly to their respective descriptions by race, place
of origin, colour or creed whereby persons of one such description
are subject to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of
another such description are not made subject or are accorded privileges
or advantages which are not afforded to persons of another such
description.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(3) Paragraph (1)(a) of this Article shall
not apply to any law so far as that law makes provision —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(<em>a</em>) for
the appropriation of the general revenues of Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(<em>b</em>) with
respect to persons who are not citizens of Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(<em>c</em>) with
respect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, devolution of property
on death or other matters of personal law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(4) Nothing contained in any law shall
be held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of paragraph (1)(<em>a</em>) of this Article to the extent that it
makes provision with respect to standards or qualifications (not being
standards or qualifications specifically relating to race, place
of origin, colour or creed) to be required of any person who is
appointed to any office in the public service, any office in a disciplined
force, or any office in the service of a body corporate established
by any law for public purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(5) Paragraph (1)(<em>b</em>)
of this Article shall not apply to anything which is expressly or
by necessary implication authorised to be done by any such provision
of law as is referred to in either of the two preceding paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(6) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(<em>b</em>) of this Article, the certificate of
the Attorney-General that the exercise of any discretion relating
to the institution, conduct or discontinuance of criminal proceedings
in any court that is vested in him or in any other person by or
under this Constitution or any other law has not been discriminatory
shall be conclusive and shall not be called in question in any court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics, bold italics
and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The
last sentence of para 32 of the 1966 Report (reproduced in full above
at [87]) is also relevant and is, in fact, referred to in para 33
of the same report (see the text in underlined bold italics in the
quotation in the preceding paragraph). The last sentence of para 32
of the 1966 Report reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Lastly, it should also be clearly and
categorically laid down that <em>there shall be </em><b><em>no discrimination </em></b><em>in
the administration of any law, except as expressly authorised by
the Constitution, against any person on the ground </em><b><em><u>only </u></em></b><em>of </em><b><em>race, religion, place of birth or descent</em></b>.
[emphasis added in italics, bold italics and underlined bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    It
can be seen that the 1966 Report was concerned, in the main, with the
entrenching of fundamental rights relating to <em>race,
language as well as religion</em> in a constitutional context.
As pointed out in the 1966 Report itself (at para 33), given Singapore’s
status as a newly-independent sovereign State at that time, “an
impregnable shield against <em>racial</em> communalism
and <em>religious</em> bigotry” [emphasis
added] had to be put in place; otherwise, societal division and/or
friction on racial, linguistic and/or religious lines could have
resulted in an acutely painful (or even fatal) rending or tearing apart
of Singapore’s social fabric. That Singapore was (and continues
to be) a multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural as well as
multi-lingual society meant that it was (and remains) particularly
susceptible to such a tragic fate if minority rights in relation
to race, language and religion are not protected constitutionally.
More importantly for the purposes of the present appeals, there
was no focus whatsoever on the issue of discrimination based on gender,
sex and/or sexual orientation in the 1966 Report, and hence, <em>no inclusion</em> of these factors as prohibited
grounds of discrimination under what is now Art 12<em>(2)</em>.
It might well be the case that the time is now appropriate for the
inclusion of these factors as prohibited grounds of discrimination
within our constitutional framework. However, that is a matter which
is entirely outside the remit of the court, and must (if at all)
be effected (as already explained above at [92]) by our legislature
via <em>a constitutional amendment instead.</em> Returning
to the present appeals, it is clear, in our view, that given the
linguistic as well as historical contexts set out above, s 377A
(which relates to matters of gender, sex and/or sexual orientation)
does <em>not</em> fall within the scope of
Art 12(2). For that reason, it cannot possibly be inconsistent with
Art 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Ms Barker
argued in her written submissions that domestic law, including the
Singapore Constitution, should as far as possible be interpreted
consistently with Singapore’s international obligations (see <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> at [59]). She further argued
that one of those obligations was to eliminate discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation, and pointed out that our Government
had stated that the Singapore Constitution contained protection
from discrimination on this particular basis. In support of this
contention, Ms Barker cited Singapore’s “Responses to the list of
issues and questions with regard to the consideration of the fourth
periodic report” dated 12 May 2011 to the United Nations’ Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (“Singapore’s
12 May 2011 Response”). Paragraphs 31 and 31.1 of Singapore’s 12 May
2011 Response state as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>31</b>.    
              <b>Please comment on reports with regard
to prevalent and systematic discrimination against women based on
sexual orientation and gender identity in the social, cultural,
political and economic spheres in the State party. What measures
are being undertaken to address these problems, especially with
a view to destigmatizing and promoting tolerance to that end.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.1  The principle of equality of all
persons before the law is enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic
of Singapore, regardless of gender, sexual orientation and gender
identity. All persons in Singapore are entitled to the equal protection
of the law, and have equal access to basic resources such as education,
housing and healthcare. Like heterosexuals, homosexuals are free to
lead their lives and pursue their social activities. Gay groups
have held public discussions and published websites, and there are
films and plays on gay themes and gay bars and clubs in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    With
respect, we do not think there is any merit in this argument by Ms Barker.
First, the above extract from para 31.1 of Singapore’s 12 May 2011
Response does not in any way suggest that Art 12(2) should be expanded
to include protection from discrimination based on “gender, sexual
orientation and gender identity” since it makes no reference to
either Art 12(2) or its prohibited grounds of discrimination (<em>viz</em>, race, religion, place of birth and
descent). The phrase “equality of all persons before the law” in
the above extract is, in our view, a reference to Art 12(1), under which
the “reasonable classification” test would indeed apply to all persons regardless
of “gender, sexual orientation and gender identity” (see above at [93]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Secondly,
and more fundamentally, international law and domestic law are regarded
in Singapore as <em>separate</em> systems
of law, and the former does not form part of the latter “until and
unless it has been applied as or definitely declared to be part
of domestic law by a domestic court” (see, in the context of customary
international law, <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> at
[91] as well as the decision of this court in <em>Nguyen
Tuong Van</em> at [94]). Therefore, for the purposes of the
present appeals, Singapore’s treaty obligations under international
treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women would not automatically have the effect
of amending the Singapore Constitution to include new prohibited grounds
of discrimination under Art 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The
present appeals were argued by both Ms Barker as well as Mr Ravi
with great passion on behalf of their respective clients. This is
not surprising, especially when one takes into account the intensely controversial
(and even emotional) nature of the arguments surrounding the nature
and function of s 377A which have been canvassed by proponents on
either side of the extra-legal divide. Indeed, many of the arguments
tendered to this court, whilst valid (or, at least, plausible) in
their own right, involved <em>extra-legal considerations
and matters of social policy which were outside the remit of the
court, and should, instead, have been canvassed in the legislative
sphere.</em> It is entirely appropriate, at this juncture, to
reiterate a point we have already made several times in the course
of this judgment, not least because it is an extremely important
and fundamental one: the court can only consider <em>legal</em> (as
opposed to <em>extra-legal</em>) arguments. This
ensures that it will not become a “mini-legislature”. The court <em>cannot – and must not</em> – assume <em>legislative</em> functions which are necessarily
beyond its remit. To do so would be to efface the very separation
of powers which confers upon the court its <em>legitimacy</em> in
the first place. If the court were to assume legislative functions,
it would no longer be able to sit to assess the legality of statutes
from an <em>objective</em> perspective. Worse
still, it would necessarily be involved in expressing views on extra-legal
issues which would – in the nature of things – be (or at least be
perceived to be) <em>subjective</em> in nature.
This would further erode the <em>legitimacy</em> of
the court, which ought only to sit to administer the law in an <em>objective</em> manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    We
have carefully considered all the legal arguments tendered to this court
in all their various forms (including the relevant historical materials). For
the reasons set out above, we dismiss both the present appeals.
Given the unusual nature of these proceedings (not least because
the decision of this court has implications for male homosexuals
or bisexual males who might fall within the ambit of s 377A generally),
we make no order as to costs both here and below. The usual consequential
orders will apply. Whilst we understand the deeply-held personal
feelings of the Appellants, there is nothing that this court can
do to assist them. Their remedy lies, if at all, in the legislative
sphere.</p>
