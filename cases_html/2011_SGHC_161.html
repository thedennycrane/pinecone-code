<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present striking-out application raises the
                    interesting question of whether it is plain and obvious that a former
                    employee’s claim against the former employer for damages in having been
                    dismissed in an <em>unfair manner</em>, or in <em>bad faith</em>, discloses no reasonable cause of
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a former employee of the
                    defendant, and she claimed to have been dismissed in an unfair manner, and/or
                    dismissed in bad faith, by the defendant. The defendant brought an application
                    to strike out the plaintiff’s claim, principally on the basis that a claim
                    brought by a former employee against an employer for the unfair manner of
                    dismissal and dismissal made in bad faith is not recognised under the law. I
                    have explained how it is not plain and obvious that the law does not recognise a
                    former employee’s claim in damages for the unfair manner of dismissal and
                    dismissal in bad faith (see especially <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>–<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>, <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>-<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>,
                        <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>-<a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>, <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>-<a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>), notwithstanding the seminal House of
                    Lords’ (as it then was) decision of <em>Johnson v Unisys
                        Ltd</em> [2003] 1 A.C. 518 (“<em>Johnson v Unisys</em>”) and the developments subsequent to the
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Nevertheless, in view of the plaintiff’s
                        <em>material admissions in the pleadings</em>, I found
                    the claim to be inescapably and fundamentally flawed, the continuance of which
                    would achieve no practical result other than to advance the plaintiff’s
                    collateral interests in pursuing the defendant to pay her more than what she was
                    contractually entitled to under her employment contract. The claim is therefore
                    struck out as it is frivolous, vexatious, and an abuse of
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff entered into a written contract of
                    employment with the defendant pursuant to a letter of appointment dated
                    26 June 1997, where the plaintiff was appointed the manager of Information
                    Systems. Its terms included a discretionary variable bonus in addition to the
                    salary, and a termination clause, the relevant parts of which has been
                    reproduced as follows (“the termination clause”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    
              <b><u>Termination</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... your service with the Company may be terminated by either party giving
                        to the other not less than one(1) month’s notice in writing or one(1)
                        month’s salary in lieu of notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your employment may be terminated immediately by the Company without prior
                        notice if you shall at any time: -</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    Commit any serious or persistent breach or any of
                            the terms of your employment; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  be guilty of any grave misconduct or wilful
                            neglect in the discharge of your duties; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  become bankrupt or make any arrangements or
                            composition with your creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff was employed by the defendant for
                    about 13 years before her employment was terminated on 21 January 2011.
                    According to the plaintiff, her contract of employment was terminated because
                    the defendant had wanted to “silence her”, as she had highlighted
                    several unlawful activities that the defendant was allegedly involved in.
                    Specifically, in 2009, the plaintiff had raised some questions regarding the
                    defendant’s conduct of alleged unlawful marketing activities to the
                    defendant’s then general manager, one Mr Daniel Touw.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently, on 17 June 2010, the Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”) preferred two charges against the
                    defendant (the legal proceedings in connection with these two charges were
                    on-going as at 29 March 2011). Under the two charges, it was alleged that
                    the defendant had published advertisements that contained express inducements to
                    purchase a tobacco product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 2 August 2010, the plaintiff again
                    highlighted the defendant’s alleged unlawful marketing activities, this
                    time to one Mr Martin Inkster (“Mr Inkster”), the
                    general manager who had replaced Mr Touw. According to the plaintiff, she
                    had strongly advised Mr Inkster to discontinue those alleged unlawful
                    marketing activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       During a performance review on 14 January
                    2011, Mr Inkster informed the plaintiff that her work performance for the
                    year 2010 was assessed as “improvable”, which was the lowest
                    rating under the defendant’s appraisal process. The appraisal was based on
                    Mr Inkster’s personal assessment of the plaintiff’s work
                    performance, as well as on the assessment provided by Ms Jennie Chan, the
                    director of Information Systems Asia, and Ms Hsu King Lan, who was
                    Ms Jennie Chan’s immediate supervisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was not disputed that the plaintiff had
                    received relatively positive annual appraisals prior to the year 2008, and that
                    the plaintiff had received a few awards in recognition of her service to the
                    defendant, the last of which was received in around November 2008. However, it
                    was also common ground between the parties that the plaintiff had been given the
                    lowest appraisal rating of “improvable” for three consecutive
                    years, from 2008 to 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 17 January 2011, the defendant, through
                    Mr Inkster and Mr Chua Chee Wee (the defendant’s Human Resource
                    officer) (“Mr Chua”) offered to terminate the
                    plaintiff’s employment with payment of one month’s salary in lieu of
                    notice in accordance with the termination clause, and an <em>ex
                        gratia</em> payment of S$40,000. The plaintiff requested for more time
                    to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Inkster and Mr Chua met the
                    plaintiff in the morning of 21 January 2011, when the plaintiff rejected the
                    defendant’s offer made on 17 January 2011. According to the
                    defendant, the plaintiff had, at this meeting, alleged that Mr Inkster had
                    conspired to terminate the plaintiff’s employment because; the plaintiff
                    had highlighted several unlawful activities that the defendant had allegedly
                    been involved in to Mr Inkster on 2 August 2010, and that the
                    plaintiff had in her possession information that may be damaging to the
                    defendant in the legal proceedings related to the two charges preferred by HSA.
                    Mr Inkster rejected these allegations and maintained that her dismissal was
                    due to the plaintiff’s poor work performance as reflected in her getting
                    the lowest rating under the defendant’s appraisal process. Mr Inkster
                    thereafter informed the plaintiff that if the terms of the 17 January
                    letter were rejected, the defendant would be constrained to terminate her
                    employment in accordance with the termination clause in the letter of
                    appointment, and asked the plaintiff to re-consider the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Inkster and Mr Chua met the
                    plaintiff again in the afternoon of 21 January 2011. According to the
                    plaintiff, she had expressed that the manner in which she was terminated was
                    unfair, especially given her many years of contribution to the defendant, and
                    the fact that the <em>ex gratia</em> payment of S$40,000
                    would in any case, have been paid to her as part of her incentive compensation.
                    It was not disputed that the plaintiff found the offer of <em>ex
                        gratia</em> payment of S$40,000 a paltry offer as she have heard of
                    cases where former employees of the defendant who were dismissed were paid much
                    more when they were dismissed. The defendant increased its offer of <em>ex gratia</em> payment from S$40,000 to S$75,000. The
                    plaintiff rejected this offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant therefore terminated the
                    employment contract by a letter dated 21 January 2011. No reasons were
                    given for the termination. It was common ground between the parties that no
                        <em>express terms</em> of the employment contract have
                    been breached in the termination. It was undisputed that, the termination clause
                    has been complied with, as the plaintiff was in fact paid <em>more than</em> one month’s salary in lieu of notice;
                    specifically the sum of S$26,993.47. This amount comprises the plaintiff’s
                    one month’s salary for the period of 1 January 2011 to
                    31 January 2011 (S$11,706.00), the plaintiff’s one month salary in
                    lieu of notice (S$11,706.00), the year end bonus pro-rated on a one month basis
                    (S$975.50), transport allowance (S$625.00), mobile phone allowance (S$90.00),
                    and payment for unconsumed accrued annual leave of 3.5 days (S$1,890.97). After
                    taking into account the CPF deductions, the sum of S$25,519.47 was credited to
                    the plaintiff’s bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff commenced an action against the
                    defendant, and claimed for damages for having been dismissed in an unfair
                    manner, and dismissed in bad faith. The plaintiff pleaded that the <em>manner</em> in which her employment was terminated was
                        <em>unfair</em> in the following (see Reply at
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the Plaintiff had expressed that the <em>manner</em> in which she was being terminated is <em>unfair</em>, especially given her many years of
                        contribution to the Defendant, the manner in which she was targeted to
                        leave, how her annual leave balance was adjusted to reflect only up till
                        31 January 2011 even though the Plaintiff’s employ had not been
                        terminated at the point of time, and the fact that the <em>ex
                            gratia payment of S$40,000 offered in the 17 January Letter would,
                            in any case, have been due from the Defendant to her as part of her
                            incentive compensation</em>.[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     With regard to her claim of having been
                    dismissed in <em>bad faith</em>, the plaintiff elaborated
                    in the pleadings the reasons and motivations behind the dismissal (see statement
                    of claim at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendant had decided to terminate the Plaintiff’s employ

                    of the Rules of Court and/or under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to
                    strike out the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was not disputed that there was no breach
                    of any <em>express terms</em> in the employment contract.
                    The termination clause expressly provides that the employment contract can be
                    terminated by either party giving to the other not less than one month’s
                    notice in writing, or one month’s salary in lieu of notice. It was also
                    not in dispute that the latter was elected and performed by the defendant; the
                    plaintiff had in fact received more than one month’s salary in lieu of
                    notice. The key dispute lies in whether there was any breach of the <b><em>implied terms</em></b> (presupposed to be) found in the
                    employment contract. In the proceedings before me, the parties dealt with the
                    matter at the <em>threshold level</em>. More specifically,
                    the plaintiff’s claim on dismissal made in an unfair manner and/or
                    dismissal made in bad faith was premised upon the <em>presupposition</em> that there exists in employment contracts (in
                    general, and subject to the express terms of the contract in question) two
                        <em>implied terms in law</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the implied term that the employer will treat an
                            employee <b><em>fairly</em></b> in the <b><em>manner</em></b> of dismissal; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the implied term that the employer <b><em>will not exercise the contractual right</em></b> to
                            terminate the employment contract <b><em>in bad
                                faith</em></b>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was submitted on behalf of the defendant,
                    that the employer’s reasons and motivations in terminating a contract of
                    employment are irrelevant under the common law, and that the law does not
                    recognise a claim based on dismissal in bad faith. The defendant relied heavily
                    on the decision of <em>Hui Cheng Wan Agnes v Nippon SP Tech (S)
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 271 (“<em>Hui
                        Cheng Wan</em>”) to support this position. Consistently, the
                    defendant’s counsel maintained that a claim based on “unfair
                    dismissal” is not recognised by the common law, and has no place in
                    Singapore law. The defendant relied principally on the decision of <em>Aldabe Fermin v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 722 to support this position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In view of the oft-stated principle in
                        <em>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee,
                        deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and another appeal</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 53 at [12], the
                        <em>overarching</em> issue is whether it is <em>plain and obvious</em> that the plaintiff’s claim for
                    damages based on unfair dismissal and/or dismissal made in bad faith discloses
                    no reasonable cause of action. This issue can in turn be answered by examining
                    two precise sub-issues of, whether it is plain and obvious that the law does not
                    recognise the existence of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">an implied term that the employer will treat an
                            employee fairly in the manner of dismissal; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">an implied term that the employer will not
                            exercise the contractual right to terminate the employment contract in
                            bad faith.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In view of the defendant’s pleaded
                    position (see [29(g)] of Defence) that the plaintiff’s claim is used to
                    wrongfully exert pressure on the defendant to pay the plaintiff monies that the
                    defendant is not lawfully obliged to pay, there is also a third issue of whether
                    the claim ought to be struck out for being frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether it is plain and obvious that the law does not recognise the
                existence of an implied term that the employer will treat an employee fairly in the
                manner of dismissal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff has the unenviable task of
                    challenging the House of Lords’ decision in <em>Johnson v
                        Unisys</em>, where it was conclusively held that the there is no cause
                    of action in common law for a claim for damages based on the unfair manner of
                    dismissal, and that such a claim was properly struck out as disclosing no
                    reasonable cause of action. Before the decision in <em>Johnson v
                        Unisys</em> is discussed further, and in order to understand the
                    reasoning of that decision in its proper context, it is useful to highlight at
                    the outset that the implied term of <em>mutual trust and
                        confidence</em> in employment contracts has apparently received
                        <em>express</em> recognition in local jurisprudence, in
                    particular, in the recent decision of <em>Wong Leong Wei Edward
                        and another v Acclaim Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd and another suit</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 352 (“<em>Wong Leong Wei v Acclaim
                        Insurance</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The implied term of mutual trust and confidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Although the implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence is distinct from the implied term that the employer will not dismiss
                    the employee unfairly; it is significant that Lord Steyn has, in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, opined that the implied term that the
                    employer will not dismiss the employee unfairly can be developed from an
                    expanded understanding of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence
                    between the employer and employee. (I add here, parenthetically, that if Lord
                    Steyn’s views are taken to be persuasive in the local context, the
                    apparent recognition of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the
                    decision of <em>Wong Leong Wei</em> would militate against
                    the defendant’s position to some extent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The existence of the implied term of mutual
                    trust and confidence in every contract of employment (subject to the express
                    terms of the contract in question) is, in so far as English law is concerned,
                    entrenched by the House of Lords’ decision in <em>Mahmud v
                        Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A</em>.
                    [1998] A.C. 20 (“<em>Mahmud v
                    BCCI</em>”). The plaintiffs were two long-serving employees (one of
                    16 years, and the other, of 12 years) of a bank which had collapsed as a result
                    of massive fraud perpetrated by those in control of the bank. After the
                    plaintiffs were dismissed on grounds of redundancy, the plaintiffs brought an
                    action asserting that by reason of the corrupt and dishonest manner in which the
                    bank had operated and the consequential collapse of the bank, the plaintiffs had
                    much difficulty in obtaining new employment because of their association with
                    the bank, and thus claimed for “stigma compensation” arising from
                    being placed in a handicap in the labour market. The Court of Appeal viewed that
                    it was bound by the rule set in an earlier House of Lords’ decision in
                        <em>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd</em>
                    [1909] A.C. 488 (“<em>Addis v
                        Gramophone</em>”) that the law recognises no claim in damages
                    for injury to feelings, mental distress, loss of reputation, or loss of
                    employment prospects stemming from the unfair, harsh or humiliating manner of
                    dismissal; and being bound by this rule, the Court of Appeal in <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em> decided that the claim for “stigma
                    compensation” discloses no reasonable cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     When the matter came before the House of
                    Lords’ in <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em>, the Law Lords
                    heavily qualified the earlier decision of <em>Addis v
                        Gramophone</em>, and held that the law recognises an implied term in
                    every contract of employment that the employer or employee would not, without
                    reasonable and proper cause, conduct oneself in a manner likely to destroy or
                    seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between the employer
                    and employee. The House of Lords held that the cause of action based upon the
                    breach of this implied term disclosed a reasonable cause of action, and found
                    that the employer in that case had breached the obligation (as derived from the
                    implied term of trust and confidence) not to carry on a dishonest or corrupt
                    business the stigma of which would imperil its employees’ chances of
                    future employment. Lord Steyn in <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em>
                    related the evolution of the implied term of trust and confidence to the
                    development of the employer-employee relationship, and suggested that the origin
                    of the term could be found in the implied general duty to co-operate to ensure
                    the performance of the contract (for the general duty to co-operate, see
                        <em>Goodway v Zurich Insurance Co</em>
                    [2004] EWHC 2825, (2004) 96 Const. L. R. 49; <em>Kellang Shipping SA v Axa Assurances Senega</em>l [2007]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep. 16 at [24], [36]), per Lord
                    Steyn at 109:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evolution of the [implied] term [of mutual trust and confidence] is a
                        comparatively recent development. The obligation probably has its origin in
                        the general duty of co-operation between contracting parties: <em>Hepple &amp; O'Higgins, Employment Law</em>, 4th ed.
                        (1981), pp. 134-135, paras. 291-292. The reason for this development is part
                        of the history of the development of employment law in this century. The
                        notion of a 'master and servant' relationship became obsolete. Lord Slynn of
                        Hadley recently noted 'the changes which have taken place in the
                        employer-employee relationship, with far greater duties imposed on the
                        employer than in the past, whether by statute or by judicial decision, to
                        care for the physical, financial and even psychological welfare of the
                        employee:' <em>Spring v. Guardian Assurance Plc</em>.
                        [1995] 2 A.C. 296 , 335B. A striking illustration of this change is Scally's
                        case [1992] 1 A.C. 294 , to which I have already referred, where the House
                        of Lords implied a term that all employees in a certain category had to be
                        notified by an employer of their entitlement to certain benefits. It was the
                        change in legal culture which made possible the evolution of the implied
                        term of trust and confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was some debate at the hearing about the possible interaction of the
                        implied obligation of confidence and trust with other more specific terms
                        implied by law. It is true that the implied term adds little to the
                        employee's implied obligations to serve his employer loyally and not to act
                        contrary to his employer's interests. The major importance of the implied
                        duty of trust and confidence lies in its impact on the obligations of the
                        employer… and the implied obligation as formulated is apt to cover
                        the great diversity of situations in which a balance has to be struck
                        between an employer's interest in managing his business as he sees fit and
                        the employee's interest in not being unfairly and improperly
                        exploited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evolution of the implied term of trust and confidence is a fact... I
                        regard the emergence of the implied obligation of mutual trust and
                        confidence as a sound development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The House of Lords’ decision of
                        <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em>, and the existence of the
                    implied term of trust and confidence between the employer and employee, has
                    apparently been accepted in local jurisprudence. In particular, the Court in
                        <em>Wong Leong Wei v Acclaim Insurance</em> observed
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51 It is thus apparent from <em>[Mahmud] v BCCI</em>
                        that a claimant will be entitled to damages from a former employer if he or
                        she can prove that the former employer was in breach of the implied term of
                        trust and confidence and which resulted in loss of future employment
                        prospects. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    ... on the authority of <em>[Mahmud]

                            that, in principle, if it can be shown that the defendant had wrongfully
                            dismissed Edward <em>in a manner</em> that was
                            dishonest or illegitimate which amounted to a breach of the implied term
                            of trust and confidence, and as a direct result of that wrongful
                            dismissal it can be proven that Edward suffered a real and provable
                            financial loss, in my view, Edward would be entitled to claim against
                            the defendant for such loss beyond the contractual notice period.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having gone through the background of the
                    implied term of mutual trust and confidence between the employer and employee
                    (which is necessary for the proper understanding of the seminal House of
                    Lords’ decision of <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>), I will
                    now move on to deal with the question proper of whether it is plain and obvious
                    that the law does not recognise the existence of an implied term that the
                    employer will treat an employee fairly in the manner of dismissal. It would be
                    appropriate to start off with the submissions made by the defendant’s
                    counsel on a local decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s submissions on Aldabe Fermin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant’s counsel, in <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> of the defendant’s further written
                    submissions, submitted that the decision of <em>Aldabe Fermin v
                        Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2010] 3 SLR 722
                        (“<em>Aldabe Fermin</em>”) is authority
                    for the position that a claim based on unfair dismissal is not applicable under
                    Singapore law. The defendant’s counsel relied on the following paragraphs
                    of the decision to support its submission:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    This statutory action of unfair dismissal is
                            entirely different from the common law doctrine of wrongful dismissal.
                            The term "wrongful dismissal" has no special legal meaning. It is merely
                            a term used to describe an employer's repudiatory breach of an
                            employment contract. The courts deal with a claim of wrongful dismissal
                            in the same way as they treat any other claim for breach of contract.
                            See <em>Port of Singapore Authority v Wallace John
                                Bryson</em> [19791980] SLR(R) 670 ("<em>Wallace</em>"). Hence, the common law rule that an
                            employer can rely on any additional reason(s) (whether known to him or
                            not) which existed at the time of dismissal to justify the dismissal
                            applies in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    In contrast, unfair dismissal under the UK Act
                            focuses on the employer's state of mind. Under the UK Act, the employer
                            is required to give the dismissed employee a letter documenting the
                            reasons for which he has been summarily dismissed. Should the employee
                            make a claim of unfair dismissal, the employer must justify the
                            dismissal with reference only to the reasons laid out in that
                            letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    The UK Act has no equivalent in Singapore.
                            Accordingly, the UK decisions cited by the plaintiff dealing with unfair
                            dismissal are not directly relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In my view, the submission is flawed is so far
                    as it is based on reading paragraphs [49] –
                    [51] of the written grounds of <em>Aldabe Fermin</em> in isolation, and out of context. There is
                    nothing in <em>Aldabe Fermin</em> that states that a common
                    law claim based on unfair dismissal is not recognised under Singapore law. The
                    precise question that the Court in <em>Aldabe Fermin</em>
                    dealt with, was whether the employer could rely on reasons that were not found
                    in the employer’s withdrawal letter to justify the summary dismissal of
                    the employee. In <em>Aldabe Fermin</em>, the
                    employer’s original reason for withdrawing its letter of offer from the
                    plaintiff-employee was due to the plaintiff’s stated desire to resign on
                    his first day of work. During the trial, the employer sought to supplement its
                    reasons for summarily dismissing the plaintiff by listing four reasons that
                    related to the plaintiff’s alleged misconduct. The Court therefore,
                    considered the relevant authorities and held that unlike the position in the UK
                    where the Employment Protection Act 1975 (c 71) (UK) requires the employer to
                    justify the dismissal only with reference to the reasons stated in the dismissal
                    letter, there is no such statutory requirement or statutory equivalent in
                    Singapore. As such, the Court concluded that (at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence, I find that the defendant was not precluded from relying on the
                        additional grounds to justify the dismissal notwithstanding the fact that
                        they were not cited in the withdrawal letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is therefore evident that the decision of
                        <em>Aldabe Fermin</em> provides no assistance to the
                    defendant. Having dealt with the defendant’s submission based on <em>Aldabe Fermin</em>, I will now proceed on to discuss the
                    seminal House of Lords decision of <em>Johnson v
                        Unisys</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The House of Lords’ decision of Johnson v Unisys</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Notwithstanding the developments in <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em> highlighted above, the House of Lords in
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys</em> was not prepared to develop
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence further into an implied term
                    that the employer will treat an employee <em>fairly</em> in
                    the <em>manner</em>of dismissal. In that case, the
                    plaintiff-employee had suffered work related stress and the employers became
                    aware of his particular psychological vulnerability. The employee was asked to
                    attend a meeting one day, and no specific allegations were put to him. He was
                    dismissed later on the same day. He made a complaint of unfair dismissal to an
                    industrial tribunal which upheld his complaint and awarded him compensation. The
                    employee thereafter commenced proceedings in court against the employer for
                    damages for wrongful dismissal, claiming that he had suffered a mental breakdown
                    and was thus unable to work due to the <em>unfair
                        manner</em> in which he had been dismissed. The Court of Appeal upheld
                    the Judge’s decision to strike out the claim as disclosing no reasonable
                    cause of action. The House of Lords conclusively held that the there is no cause
                    of action in common law for the unfair manner of dismissal, and that the claim
                    was properly struck out. In particular, Lord Hoffmann held that, whilst it has
                    been established in <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em> that a breach of
                    the implied term of trust and confidence can give rise to an action in damages,
                    the courts are not prepared to extend the implied term of trust and confidence
                    to the <b><em>manner</em></b> of the dismissal, per Lord Hoffmann
                    at [44] to [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Mahmud v Bank of Credit and Commerce International
                            SA</em> [1998] AC 20, 51 Lord Steyn said that
                            the<b><em> true ratio of Addis's case was that damages were
                            recoverable only for loss caused by a breach of contract, not for loss
                            caused by the manner of its breach</em></b>... the only loss caused by
                        a wrongful dismissal flows from a failure to give proper notice or make
                        payment in lieu. Therefore, if wrongful dismissal is the only cause of
                        action, nothing can be recovered for mental distress or damage to
                        reputation. On the other hand, if such damage is loss flowing from a breach
                        of another implied term of the contract, Addis's case does not stand in the
                        way. That is why, in Mahmud's case itself, damages were recoverable for
                        financial loss flowing from damage to reputation caused by a breach of the
                        implied term of trust and confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case, Mr Johnson says likewise that his <b><em>psychiatric injury is a consequence of a breach of the implied term of
                            trust and confidence</em></b>, <b><em>which required
                            Unisys to treat him fairly in the procedures for dismissal</em></b>.
                        He says that implied term now fills the gap which Lord Shaw of Dunfermline
                        perceived and regretted in Addis's case, at pp 504-505, by creating a breach
                        of contract additional to the dismissal itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I rather doubt whether the term of trust and confidence should be
                        pressed so far. In the way it has always been formulated, it is concerned
                        with preserving the continuing relationship which should subsist between
                        employer and employee. So it does not seem altogether appropriate for use in
                        connection with the way that relationship is terminated.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The rationale behind the decision in Johnson v Unisys</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The necessary consequence of the above is
                    that, as far as the position in English law is concerned, the law does not
                    recognise any implied term that an employer will not act unfairly towards the
                    employee in relation to the manner of dismissal, and any claim based on such
                    implied term that does not exist would not disclose a reasonable cause of action
                    in common law. Therefore, going by the <em>ratio</em> in
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys itself</em>, it would be plain and
                    obvious that a claim for damages based on unfair dismissal discloses no
                    reasonable cause of action. However, if one examines the <b><em>reasons</em></b> behind the <em>ratio</em> in
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, the situation becomes
                    evidently more “grey” and less plain and obvious than it seemed to
                    be. In coming to their decision, the House of Lords deferred to
                    Parliament’s expressed intention in having enacted the Employment Rights
                    Act 1996, which granted employment tribunals the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon
                    employer-employee disputes on unfair dismissal, and which further provided a
                    compensatory regime to allow employees to be compensated for being unfairly
                    dismissed. Lord Nicholls expressed the view that this statutory right not to be
                    unfairly dismissed could not satisfactorily co-exist with a common law right (at
                        [2]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having heard full argument on the point, I am persuaded that a common law
                        right embracing the manner in which an employee is dismissed cannot
                        satisfactorily coexist with the statutory right not to be unfairly
                        dismissed. A newly developed common law right of this nature, covering the
                        same ground as the statutory right, would fly in the face of the limits
                        Parliament has already prescribed on matters such as the classes of
                        employees who have the benefit of the statutory right, the amount of
                        compensation payable and the short time limits for making claims. It would
                        also defeat the intention of Parliament that claims of this nature should be
                        decided by specialist tribunals, not the ordinary courts of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The deference to Parliament’s intention
                    was evident in Lord Hoffmann’s grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Employment law requires a balancing of the
                            interests of employers and employees, with proper regard not only to the
                            individual dignity and worth of the employees but also to the general
                            economic interest. Subject to observance of fundamental human rights,
                                <em>the point at which this balance should be struck
                                is a matter for democratic decision</em>. The development of
                            the common law by the judges plays a subsidiary role. Their traditional
                            function is to adapt and modernise the common law. But such developments
                            must be consistent with legislative policy as expressed in statutes. The
                            courts may proceed in harmony with Parliament but there should be no
                            discord.</p>

                            creating a statutory implied term that the power of dismissal should be

                            represented an attempt to balance fairness to employees against the

                            restricted that remedy to a maximum of £11,000, whereas
                            Mr Johnson wants to claim a good deal more. The question is whether
                            the courts should develop the common law to give a parallel remedy which
                            is not subject to any such

                            pay respectful tribute, went in my opinion to the heart of the matter
                            when he said:</p>

                            and I ask myself, if this is the situation, why on earth do we have this
                            special statutory framework? What is the point of it if it can be
                            circumvented in this way? ... it would mean that effectively the
                            statutory limit on compensation for unfair dismissal would
                            disappear."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    I can see no answer to these questions. For the
                            judiciary to construct a general common law remedy for unfair

                            intention of Parliament that there should be such a remedy but that it
                            should be limited in application and extent.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Lord Millet held the same view, and added the
                    simple, yet powerful point that, in view of the statutory right not to be
                    unfairly dismissed, it would <em>not be necessary</em> to
                    imply in every contract of employment a term to the same effect (at
                    [80]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the creation of the statutory right has made any such development
                        of the common law both unnecessary and undesirable. In the great majority of
                        cases the new common law right would merely replicate the statutory right;
                        and it is obviously unnecessary to imply a term into a contract to give one
                        of the contracting parties a remedy which he already has without it. In
                        other cases, where the common law would be giving a remedy in excess of the
                        statutory limits or to excluded categories of employees, it would be
                        inconsistent with the declared policy of Parliament. In all cases it would
                        allow claims to be entertained by the ordinary courts when it was the policy
                        of Parliament that they should be heard by specialist tribunals with members
                        drawn from both sides of industry. And, even more importantly, the
                        coexistence of two systems, overlapping but varying in matters of detail and
                        heard by different tribunals, would be a recipe for chaos. All coherence in

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Transposing Johnson v Unisys onto the local existing statutory
                framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As can be seen from the above, the House of
                    Lords in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em> was constrained in
                    implying the term not to be unfairly dismissed in employment contracts, in view
                    of the express statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed found in Part X of
                    the UK Employment Rights Act. It is therefore arguable that, given that there is
                    no such <em>equivalent</em> legislation in Singapore (as
                    observed in <em>Aldabe Fermin</em> at [51]), there would be no similar impediment (as
                    the one faced by the House of Lords) in preventing our Courts from implying a
                    term to protect employees from being unfairly dismissed, into every contract of
                    employment. Despite so, it cannot be said that the existing legislative
                    framework in Singapore is entirely oblivious to the possibility of employees
                    being dismissed in an unfair manner. For a start, s 10 of the Employment
                    Act (Cap 91, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) mandates that, in
                    a situation where notice is given by the employer for termination of contract,
                    the period of notice should be as that agreed in the contact of employment. If
                    the contract does not provide for the period of notice, the Act stipulates a
                    graduated fixed period of notice; the longer the employee has been employed, the
                    longer the period of notice:</p>

                    provides that an employer may, <b><em>after due inquiry</em></b>,
                    dismiss the employee without notice on grounds of misconduct. If the employee
                    thinks that he was dismissed <b><em>without just cause or
                        excuse</em></b>, he may make representations in writing to the Minister.
                    Under the Act, the Minister has the power to request the Commissioner to
                        <em>inquire</em> into the dismissal to determine
                    whether the dismissal was made without just cause or excuse. If the Minister is
                    satisfied that the dismissal was made without just cause or excuse, he may
                    direct the employer be reinstated or to pay an amount of wages to compensate the
                    employee. He has the power, under s 14(4) to give these directions
                        “<em>notwithstanding any rule of law or agreement to
                        the contrary</em>”. Section 14(5) provides that the
                    Minister’s decision is final and conclusive, and cannot be challenged in
                    any court (subject to the requirements of natural justice; see <em>Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd v Minister for

                    Minister’s direction to reinstate or to compensate in wages the employee
                        <em>operates as a bar against any action for

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">How it is not plain and obvious that the law does not recognise a
                former employee’s claim in damages for the unfair manner of
                dismissal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In view of the various measures of statutory
                    protection given to employees under the Act, it could be argued that, in line
                    with Lord Millet’s reasoning in <em>Johnson v
                        Unisys</em> (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above), it
                    is not altogether necessary to imply into the employment contract a term to
                    protect employees from being dismissed in an unfair manner. Indeed, one could
                    argue that the existing statutory framework under the Act manifests
                    Parliament’s intention that matters in the sphere of protecting employees
                    from being unfairly dismissed should be legislated, and that these matters lies
                    within the province of Parliament. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the
                    Employment Act does not apply to all contracts of employment. A person employed
                    in a managerial or an executive position, and who receives a salary exceeding
                    $4,500 a month (excluding overtime payments, bonus payments, annual wage
                    supplements, productivity incentive payments and any allowance) does not
                    fall within the definition of “employee” under s 2 of the Act
                    (it is not in dispute that the Act does not apply to the plaintiff’s
                    contract of employment); while the Act has limited applicability to persons
                    employed in a managerial position or an executive position and who receives a
                    salary not exceeding $4,500 a month (see s 2(2) of the Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Furthermore, despite the substantial measure
                    of protection given to (certain definitions of) employees under the Employment
                    Act, it remained so that <b><em>unlike the position in
                        England</em></b>, <b><em>there is no express statutory right
                        not to be unfairly dismissed</em></b>. Given that there is no such express
                    statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed, Lord Millet’s reasoning in
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys</em> based on the <b><em>necessary</em></b> implication of terms (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above) <em>would not be
                        evidently</em> applicable to the local context. Nevertheless, this is
                    not a case where an argument could simply be made that, <b><em>just
                        because</em></b> the express statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed
                    does not exist in Singapore, an employee would <em>ipso
                        facto</em> have a common law claim in damages for unfair dismissal;
                    for there is undeniable force in Lord Hoffmann’s argument in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em> (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above) that the implication of a term to support such a
                    claim would be a decision based upon <b><em>policy</em></b>, and
                    would involve the intricate balance between the individual dignity and worth of
                    the employees against the general economic interests of the community. Simply
                    put, the questions relating to the fairness of dismissal, in so far as <em>every contract of employment</em> is concerned, would be a
                    matter of (in Lord Hoffmann’s view) <b><em>democratic
                        decision</em></b> that falls outside the province of the
                Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     That the issues involved in the sphere of
                    unfair dismissal requires a considered and nuanced approach in taking into
                    account the interests of all stakeholders is without doubt, and is particularly
                    emphasized by the fact that, in England, <b><em>even
                        with</em></b> an existing comprehensive statutory regime to protect
                    employees from unfair dismissal, the House of Lords found it necessary to
                        <em>minimize</em> the impact of the <em>ratio</em> in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>. In this
                    regard, it is pertinent that in about three years after the decision of
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, the House of Lords took the
                    opportunity to clarify and delineate the <em>ratio</em> of
                        <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, in the decisions of
                        <em>Eastwood v Magnox Electric</em> and <em>McCabe v Cornwall County Council</em> [2005]
                    1 A.C. 503 (“<em>Eastwood</em>” and
                        “<em>McCabe</em>”), in what Lord Nicholls
                    termed the “<em>Johnson exclusion
                    area</em>”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The boundary line</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Identifying the boundary of the <em>'Johnson</em> exclusion area', as it has been called, is
                            comparatively straightforward. The statutory code provides remedies for
                            infringement of the statutory right not to be dismissed unfairly. An
                            employee's remedy for unfair dismissal, whether actual or constructive,
                            is the remedy provided by statute. If before his dismissal, whether
                            actual or constructive, an employee has acquired a cause of action at
                            law, for breach of contract or otherwise, that cause of action remains
                            unimpaired by his subsequent unfair dismissal and the statutory rights
                            flowing therefrom. By definition, in law such a cause of action exists
                            independently of the dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In the ordinary course, suspension apart, an
                            employer's failure to act fairly in the steps leading to dismissal does
                            not of itself cause the employee financial loss. <em>The
                                loss arises when the employee is dismissed and it arises by reason
                                of his dismissal. Then the resultant claim for loss falls squarely
                                within the Johnson exclusion area</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    Exceptionally this is not so. Exceptionally,
                            financial loss may flow directly from the <em>employer's
                                failure to act fairly when taking steps leading to
                                dismissal</em>. Financial loss flowing from suspension is an
                            instance. Another instance is cases such as those now before the House,
                            when an employee suffers financial loss from psychiatric or other
                            illness caused by his pre-dismissal unfair treatment. In such cases the
                            employee has a common law cause of action which precedes, and is
                            independent of, his subsequent dismissal. In respect of his subsequent
                            dismissal he may of course present a claim to an employment tribunal. If
                            he brings proceedings both in court and before a tribunal he cannot
                            recover any overlapping heads of loss twice over.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Lord Nicholls’ definition of the
                        “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area” reduces
                    the impact of the <em>ratio</em> in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>. Under the defined “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area”, a claim in damages arising from
                    the <em>unfair manner of dismissal</em> falls within the
                    exclusion, and does not give rise to any common law claim, for such a claim
                    already exists within the statutory protection against unfair dismissal; whereas
                    a claim in damages arising from <em>pre-dismissal
                        events</em> falls outside the exclusion area and would give rise to a
                    common law cause of action for breach of the contract (specifically, breach of
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence) that is independent from the
                    fact of the dismissal itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In <em>Eastwood</em>, the
                    two employees-plaintiffs had a superior who had a long standing grudge against
                    them. The superior and the employees’ manager had worked together to
                    encourage colleagues to provide false statements and to formulate complaints of
                    sexual harassment against the employees. The employees was suspended (but not
                    dismissed), without being informed of the allegations made against them. The
                    employees claimed that the members of management conduct a campaign to
                    demoralise them prior to their dismissal, and that this was a breach of the
                    implied term of trust and confidence which took place prior to their dismissal.
                    They claimed to have suffered psychiatric illnesses caused by a deliberate
                    course of conduct by members of the management. Lord Nicholls, applying the
                        “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area”, held
                    that the employees’ claim in <em>Eastwood</em> fell
                    outside the exclusion area and found that the claim in damages gave rise to a
                    cause of action in common law. In doing so, His Lordship was at the same time
                    acutely aware of the practical problems that would naturally arise from the
                        “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area”, one of
                    which was the disconcerting anomaly that an employer would be better off
                    dismissing an employee rather than to suspend him, for an employer in the former
                    position would be able to restrict the amount of damages compensable to that of
                    the prescribed statutory limit; whereas employees would attempt to circumvent
                    the statutory limit by identifying facts which occurred prior to the dismissal,
                    in order to create a claim based not on the unfairness of the dismissal itself,
                    but on the breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence (per Lord
                    Nicholls):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    ...the existence of this boundary line means that

                            constructive dismissal <em>a distinction will have to be

                            where financial loss is claimed as the consequence of psychiatric
                            illness said to have been brought on by the employer's conduct before
                            the employee was dismissed. Judges and tribunals, faced perhaps with
                            conflicting medical evidence, <em>may have to decide
                                whether the fact of dismissal was really the last straw which proved

                                occurred even before he was dismissed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    The existence of this boundary line produces other

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Lord Nicholls’ definition of the
                        “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area” in
                        <em>Eastwood</em>, made in about three years after the
                    decision of <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, serves to emphasize
                    the fact that the <em>ratio</em> in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em> is <em>necessarily
                        dependent</em> upon the existence of the statutory right not to be
                    unfairly dismissed; the delineation set out by the “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion area” thus underscores the symmetry
                    between the non-existence of a common law cause of action in unfair dismissal
                    and the existence of a corresponding statutory cause of action. Likewise, the
                    existence of a common law cause of action for breach of an implied term of
                    mutual trust and confidence reflects the non-existence of a corresponding
                    statutory cause of action. Applying the logic of that symmetry to the present
                    context may very well lead to a compelling case that a common law cause of
                    action in unfair dismissal would exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Subject to Lord Hoffmann’s significant
                    caveat (in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>) that the sphere of
                    unfair dismissal should be a matter of <em>democratic
                        decision</em>, one could argue that the non-existence of an express
                    statutory protection against unfair dismissal signify <em>Parliament’s intention</em> to leave this issue to be decided
                    by the Courts. In my view, given that the position in England itself is still in
                    a state of development (as is evident from the recent judicial pronouncements in
                        <em>Eastwood</em>), despite having the benefit of
                    guidance from a comprehensive and express statutory regime in Part X of the UK
                    Employment Rights Act against unfair dismissal of employees, it would be
                    ambitious for the defendant in the present case to proclaim that the position in
                    Singapore is settled. This is particularly so given that the Courts in Singapore
                    have not, to date, had the opportunity to consider the reasoning in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, and to decide to <em>what extent</em> would the reasoning in that decision apply <em>viz</em> the existing local legislative
                framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Whether the existing statutory regime in
                    Singapore is sufficient to protect employees’ rights relating to unfair
                    dismissal, and whether <em>even if</em> sufficient, are
                    there any other reasons to (or not to) imply such a term (with especial regard
                    to Lord Hoffmann’s view that this could very well be a question to be
                    decided on <em>policy</em> grounds (and hence to be left to
                    the province of Parliament)), are questions that have yet to be <em>fully</em> considered by a Court of law. There is no doubt
                    that time is required for the development of the implied term of mutual trust
                    and confidence which was apparently accepted in the local decision of <em>Wong Leong Wei v Acclaim Insurance</em> only very recently,
                    especially for a task as important as that of implying a <em>further</em> (and separate) term in <em>every contract
                        of employment</em>. For the reasons above, I am <em>not</em> prepared to strike out the plaintiff’s claim <em>on the ground</em> that a claim for damages based on unfair
                    dismissal clearly and plainly discloses no reasonable cause of
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether it is plain and obvious that the law does not recognise the
                existence of an implied term that the employer will not exercise the contractual
                right to terminate the employment contract in bad faith</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant’s position is that the
                    implied term that the employer will not exercise the contractual right to
                    terminate the employment contract in bad faith does not exist in employment
                    contracts. This is because the reasons and motivations behind the dismissal are,
                    according to the defendant, irrelevant. This position is substantially weakened
                    by the local Court of Appeal’s decision of <em>Latham Scott
                        v. Credit Suisse First Boston</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30
                        (“<em>Latham Scott</em>”). In that case,
                    the employee (“Latham”) entered into a written contract of
                    employment with the employer (“CSFB”). Its terms included a
                    discretionary bonus in addition to the salary, and it also provided that either
                    party could terminate the contract by giving the other a month’s notice.
                    Latham was asked by CSFB to leave shortly after he started work, and CSFB
                    terminated the contract of employment through a letter giving him a
                    month’s remuneration in lieu of notice. Latham commenced an action against
                    CSFB for damages in wrongful dismissal. Latham also alleged that CSFB had acted
                    in bad faith in dismissing him, thereby wrongfully depriving him of the chance
                    to earn a bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Court of Appeal (at [42]) considered the allegations based on bad
                    faith as Latham’s “second <em>substantive</em>
                    ground of appeal”, and considered the evidence to determine the <b><em>motivations</em></b> behind the dismissal. Upon an analysis of
                    the evidence, the Court of Appeal found that Latham’s dismissal could not
                    be said to be <em>purely motivated</em> by Latham’s
                    complaints of alleged insider trading made against some of CSFB’s senior
                    employees; and that there were several other events which related to
                    Latham’s attitude and the poor manner in which he interacted with his
                    colleagues which amounted to reasonable grounds for dismissal. The Court of
                    Appeal held that Latham’s dismissal was motivated by several factors, one
                    of which was that his relationship with his colleagues had deteriorated to such
                    a great extent that CSFB thought Latham should no longer remain in its
                    employment. As such, the Court of Appeal <em>concluded</em>
                    that CSFB did not act in bad faith in dismissing Latham (at para [52]-[53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, even if Latham was right to complain and comment that the use
                        of the information relating to the Srithai bonds buy-back by Harvey and Chan
                        amounted to insider trading, and that Harvey was annoyed with him for this
                        reason, <em>it did not mean that Latham's dismissal was
                            motivated purely by this event</em>. Although Latham tried to
                        establish that this was the sole reason for his dismissal, we have already
                        considered the fact that <em>there were many other complaints
                            about his attitude and the manner in which he interacted with his
                            colleagues, the Bloomberg incident and the Chakra incident, that
                            amounted to reasonable grounds for CSFB to decide that Latham should not
                            be retained</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Latham's complaints to Harvey and some other senior officers at
                        CSFB that Chan was mis-marking CSFB's books in order avoid paying taxes,
                        that Latham claimed annoyed Chan and Harvey so much so that he was dismissed
                        for it. In the first place, the judicial commissioner found that Latham's
                        accusations were unfounded. Latham himself recognised this but asserted that
                        there was no malice in his actions. This was accepted by the judicial
                        commissioner. Again, <em>it would be wrong to accept Latham's
                            suggestion that his dismissal was motivated by Chan's and Harvey's anger
                            and bad faith in relation to this matter. Clearly, his relationship with
                            his colleagues and Harvey was not going well and, by 19 September 1997,
                            had deteriorated to such an extent that the Chakra incident was the
                            final straw</em>. On an overall assessment of the events
                        throughout the five to six months of Latham's employment with CSFB, rather
                        than regarding the incidents in isolation, it was apparent that Latham was
                        not able to fit into the organisation. Thus, CSFB was entitled to decide
                        that Latham should no longer remain in their employ even though they might
                        well have breached the contractual provision requiring them to give one
                        month's notice to him. <em>CSFB did not act in bad faith in
                            dismissing Latham</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     An argument could be made that the presence of
                    the employer’s duty not to exercise its contractual right to terminate the
                    employment in bad faith was <em>implicit</em> in the
                    decision of <em>Latham Scott</em>, as it could be said that
                    the Court of Appeal’s willingness to consider the evidence to decide
                    whether the employer had acted in bad faith, <em>presupposes</em> that the employer had a duty not terminate

                    case. It was submitted that <em>Latham Scott</em> is a
                    different case because the employment contract in that case does not expressly
                    provide that the contract can be terminated with one month’s salary in
                    lieu of notice, unlike the present case. When this submission was made before
                    me, I queried counsel why would a duty not to dismiss in bad faith (“the
                    duty”) exist in a contract of employment which allows for termination
                    with a month’s notice (such as the situation in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em>), but that such a duty does not exist in a contract of
                    employment which allows for termination with payment of a month’s salary
                    in lieu of notice (such as the situation in the present case)? I asked for the
                    rationale of such an anomaly, and counsel submitted that it was because in the
                    present case where the contract can be terminated with payment of salary in lieu
                    of notice, there was no requirement to provide any reasons for the dismissal;
                    and as there was no such requirement to give reasons, it must follow that the
                    reasons for the dismissal are irrelevant (“counsel’s
                    submission”). In addition, it is not in dispute that the employment
                    contract does not expressly state that reasons must be given for the
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Counsel’s submission presupposes that
                    there can be no claims of dismissal in bad faith where there is no requirement
                    to provide reasons for dismissal. It is not necessary to decide whether
                    counsel’s submission is correct in law, suffice to say that the position
                    is <em>not plain and obvious</em>, in view that the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Latham Scott</em> had went on to consider
                    the substantive allegations of bad faith, <em>notwithstanding</em> the Court of Appeal’s express recognition
                    that there was <em>no requirement</em> to provide any
                    reasons to terminate the employment contract (at [42], [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Latham's <em>second substantive ground of
                            appeal</em> was that CSFB had acted in bad faith in dismissing
                        him, thereby wrongfully depriving him of the chance to earn his bonus
                        payment. Latham's argument in this respect was two-pronged. On the one hand,
                        he said that he made substantial contributions to CSFB during the course of
                        his employment with them. In support of this allegation, he cited a list of
                        projects that he was involved in where he helped CSFB make profits as a
                        result of his proficient research skills. Latham also highlighted Harvey's
                        favourable written assessment of him in late June 1997. Furthermore, Latham
                        was allotted a tentative bonus of US$400,000 by Harvey as late as August
                        1997, a mere three weeks before his dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…It may well be that Latham was performing reasonably well in
                        certain areas but not in all. This did not mean that he was immune from
                        being contractually dismissed. We noted from the outset that Latham's
                        termination, eventually found to be wrongful by the judicial commissioner on
                        the technical ground that he was not given the requisite one month's notice,
                        was purportedly contractual. CSFB never claimed that Latham had committed
                        some form of gross misconduct that entitled them to terminate his employment
                        immediately. <em>Under the terms of the contract, both Latham
                            and CSFB could terminate the employment contract without any reason, as
                            long as the one month notice period was adhered to. As such, the focus
                            here would be whether CSFB acted in bad faith by dismissing Latham
                            because he had complained rightfully that his colleagues were engaging
                            in insider trading as regards the Srithai issue</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As can be seen from the above, the fact that
                    the employment contract could be terminated without the requirement to provide
                    reasons, did not prevent the Court of Appeal in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em> from considering the substantive allegations of bad
                    faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s submissions on Hui Cheng Wan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Nevertheless, the defendant’s counsel
                    made a second argument. It was submitted that the decision of <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em> is authority for the position that the reasons and
                    motivations behind an employer’s decision to terminate a contract of
                    employment are irrelevant, whenever there is an express term that allows the
                    employer to terminate the employment contract with payment of salary in lieu of
                    notice (such as that in the present case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Just like in the present case, the employment
                    contract in <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em> provided that either
                    party may terminate the contract with a month’s notice in writing, or one
                    month’s salary in lieu of notice. As a result of the employee’s
                    (“Ms Hui”) conduct and her alleged refusal to follow
                    instructions, the employer terminated the contract of employment with payment of
                    one month’s salary in lieu of notice. Ms Hui commenced an action
                    against the employer for wrongful dismissal. The Court found that the employment
                    contract was validly terminated; even though one Mr Kondo (the managing
                    director of the parent company of Ms Hui’s employer) gave evidence
                    that the employer would not issue a one month notice without good reason, the
                    employer was nevertheless entitled under the contract to terminate her
                    employment with payment of one month’s salary in lieu of notice even
                    without any good reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Ms Hui, however made an alternative
                    argument that her dismissal was made in bad faith because she “knew too
                    much”. In this regard, the facts in <em>Hui Cheng
                        Wan</em> are similar to the present case, where the employee was
                    dismissed because the employer allegedly intended to “silence
                    her”. More specifically, Ms Hui claimed she knew that there had been
                    excessive purchases at inflated prices by the employer from several companies
                    set up by a lady who had a close and personal relationship with Mr Kondo,
                    and that Mr Kondo had revised his own salary package with prior approval.
                    In the hearing before me, the defendant’s counsel brought my attention to
                    para [89] of the decision, where the Court observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was of the view that the allegation of bad faith was a <em>red herring</em> as Nippon SPT was entitled to terminate
                        her employment by paying one month’s salary in lieu of notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The defendant’s counsel submitted that
                    the above paragraph shows that that the reasons and motivations behind an
                    employer’s decision to terminate a contract of employment are irrelevant,
                    where there is an express term that allows the employer to terminate the
                    employment contract with payment of salary in lieu of notice. The true purport
                    of this observation that the allegation of bad faith was a “red
                    herring” is unclear (and it could very well be <em>obiter
                        dicta</em>), as the Court went on to find that Ms Hui had failed
                    to establish bad faith <em>on the merits</em> of her
                    allegations (see <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em> at [90]). With
                    respect, it does not appear, at least from the written decision in <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em> that the observation was made with
                    consideration of any authorities. No authorities were mentioned in arriving at
                    that observation, not least the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Latham Scott</em> which was decided and reported before the decision
                    of <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em>. Notwithstanding the “red
                    herring” observation made in <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em>,
                    the pertinent question remained: what could be the rationale to explain the
                    anomaly where bad faith is relevant in the context where the employment contract
                    can be terminated with a month’s notice (as was the situation in <em>Latham Scott</em>), but was irrelevant in the context where
                    the employment contract can be terminated with payment of a month’s salary
                    in lieu of notice? In both cases, there is no requirement to provide reasons;
                    yet this did not prevent the Court of Appeal in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em> from considering the substantive allegations of bad faith.
                    The defendant’s counsel had no answer to explain the rationale for this
                    purported anomaly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In my view, notwithstanding the submissions
                    made on <em>Hui Cheng Wan</em>, the bigger obstacle to the
                    plaintiff’s case lies in the seminal Court of Appeal decision of <em>Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Ng Giap
                    Hon</em>”) (a decision which the defendant did not submit upon).
                    The Court of Appeal decided <em>not</em> to endorse the
                    doctrine of good faith in contracts in Singapore, and dismissed the
                    appellant’s argument for an implied duty of good faith in the agreement
                    between the appellant and the respondent, <em>in so far
                        as</em> the appellant’s argument for an implied duty of good
                    faith is premised upon an implied term in law that applies to <em>all</em> contracts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    The implied terms
                            which the appellant sought to rely upon are (as just mentioned) framed
                            in the alternative and are to be found in para 14 of the Statement of
                            Claim, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]here was an implied duty of good faith between the [appellant] and
                            [the first respondent] as between agent and principal. Further or in the
                            alternative, it was an implied term of the [A]gency [A]greement that the
                            [first respondent] would not do anything to deprive the [appellant] from
                            earning his commission. [emphasis added; underlining in original
                            omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We shall hereafter refer to the former term (ie, that relating to the
                        implied duty of good faith) as "the First Implied Term", and to the latter
                        term (ie, that relating to the first respondent's obligation not to do
                        anything to deprive the appellant from earning his commission) as "the
                        Second Implied Term".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    The First Implied Term is (as can be seen from the
                            quotation in the preceding paragraph) premised on the general doctrine
                            of good faith and (more importantly) appears to fall within the broader
                            category of "terms implied in law"…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    It is clear, in our view, that if a term relating
                            to good faith is to be implied into the Agency Agreement, <em>that term cannot be premised on the broader category of
                                "terms implied in law", especially having regard (in the context of
                                the present appeal) to the general doctrine of good faith that
                                constitutes the pith and marrow of the First Implied
                            Term</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    … it is not surprising that the <em>doctrine of good faith continues… to be a fledgling
                                one in the Commonwealth</em>. Much clarification is required,
                            even on a theoretical level. Needless to say, u<em>ntil
                                the theoretical foundations as well as the structure of this
                                doctrine are settled</em>, it would be inadvisable (to say the
                            least) to even attempt to apply it in the practical sphere … In
                            the context of the present appeal, this is, in our view, <em>the strongest reason as to why we cannot accede to the
                                appellant's argument that this court should endorse an implied duty
                                of good faith in the Singapore context</em>. The First Implied
                            Term should not, therefore, be implied into the Agency
                        Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As emphasized by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Ng Giap Hon</em>, the doctrine of good faith is a
                    fledgling doctrine in English and Singapore contract law which requires much
                    clarification, even on a theoretical level. There remain differing views as to
                    what the doctrine meant and how it was to be applied. In so far as the implied
                    term that the employer will not exercise the contractual right to terminate the
                    employment contract in bad faith is based upon the doctrine of good faith, the
                    authority of <em>Ng Giap Hon</em> poses substantial
                    difficulties to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Nevertheless, the precise question of whether,
                        <b><em>in the sphere of employment contracts</em></b>, there
                    is a <b><em>sui generis</em></b> contractual duty not to
                    terminate the employment contract in bad faith, was not placed before the court
                    in <em>Ng Giap Hon</em>, neither was the authority of
                        <em>Latham Scott</em> placed before the Court of Appeal
                    for consideration. It would also not have escaped the defendant’s counsel
                    that the plaintiff’s basis for establishing such a duty was intricately
                    linked with the argument based on unfair dismissal; and in that regard, it is
                    pertinent that, in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>, Lord Hoffmann
                    was prepared to contemplate that the implied term that the power of dismissal
                    should be exercised fairly and in good faith can be developed from the existing
                    implied term of trust and confidence between the employer and employee:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    In this case, Mr Johnson says … that
                            his psychiatric injury is a consequence of a breach of the implied term
                            of trust and confidence, which required Unisys to treat <em>him fairly in the procedures for
                                dismissal…</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    … I rather doubt whether the <em>term of trust and confidence</em> should be pressed
                            so far. In the way it has always been formulated, it is concerned with
                            preserving the continuing relationship which should subsist between
                            employer and employee. So it does not seem altogether appropriate for
                            use in connection with the way that relationship is terminated.
                                <em>If one is looking for an implied term, I think a
                                more elegant solution is McLachlin J's implication of a separate
                                term that the power of dismissal will be exercised fairly and in
                                good faith</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The decision of <em>Ng Giap
                        Hon</em> would pose no difficulty, if indeed, the <em>juridical basis</em> of the implied term that the employer will not
                    exercise the contractual right to terminate the employment contract in bad
                    faith, is derived not from the doctrine of good faith, but from the implied term
                    of mutual trust and confidence between the employer and employee (as suggested
                    by Lord Hoffmann in <em>Johnson v Unisys</em>), restricted
                    in its <em>sui generis</em> form to employment contracts
                    only. Conclusively, in view of the decision of <em>Latham
                        Scott</em>, and in particular, the Court of Appeal’s
                    consideration of the evidence to determine the <em>motivations</em> behind the dismissal as well as the Court of
                    Appeal’s <em>conclusion</em> that the dismissal was
                        <em>not made in bad faith</em>, it <em>could not</em> be said that the law plainly and obviously does not
                    recognise the existence of an implied term that the employer will not exercise
                    the contractual right to terminate the employment contract in bad faith. The

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    This is the widest
                            general ground for striking out. Needless to say, there is, by its very
                            definition, an inevitable overlap with the other grounds. As Yong CJ
                            succinctly emphasised in <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek
                                Kiau</em> at [15], abuse of process characterises a proceeding
                            which is "wanting in bona fides and is frivolous, vexatious or
                            oppressive". The Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peter
                                &amp; Partners v Wee Chong Jin</em> ([36] supra) at [22]
                            broadly outlined what amounts to an abuse of process:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The term, 'abuse of the process of the Court', in O 18 r 19(1)(d), has
                            been given a wide interpretation by the courts. It includes
                            considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. This term
                            signifies that the process of the court must be used bona fide and
                            properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent the improper use
                            of its machinery. It will prevent the judicial process from being used
                            as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. The
                            categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous, vexatious or an abuse
                            of process are not closed and will depend on all the relevant
                            circumstances of the case. A type of conduct which has been judicially
                            acknowledged as an abuse of process is the bringing of an action for a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the present case, it is common ground
                    between the parties that the plaintiff was paid <em>more
                        than</em> one month’s salary in lieu of notice; specifically the
                    sum of S$26,993.47. The plaintiff pleaded in [15] of the statement of claim the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By reason of the said unfair dismissal and/or dismissal in bad faith, the
                        Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     According to the plaintiff’s <em>pleaded</em> position, the <em>material
                        facts</em> are unlike the case of <em>Johnson v
                        Unisys</em> where the employee suffered a mental breakdown due to the
                    unfair manner of dismissal. The plaintiff did not plead that she had suffered
                    injury to feelings, mental distress, and/or loss of reputation as a result of
                    the unfair dismissal (as was the case in <em>Addis v
                        Gramophone</em>) (I add here parenthetically, that this does not
                    conclude that even if such material facts were pleaded, that the alleged losses
                    of such nature were recoverable at law). Unlike the case of <em>Mahmud v BCCI</em>, this was not a case where the plaintiff pleaded
                    that she had suffered loss of employment prospects, or that she had difficulty
                    finding alternative employment as a result of the unfair manner of dismissal or
                    dismissal made in bad faith. It was also not pleaded that she suffered
                    psychiatric injury or psychiatric illnesses (as was pleaded in <em>Eastwood</em> and <em>McCabe</em>). Nor
                    did the plaintiff plead that she had suffered loss of future earnings, or
                    expenses incurred in obtaining future employment, as a result of the unfair
                    dismissal. The plaintiff pleaded for damages to be assessed. However, the
                    damages have to be assessed based on the losses and damages <em>suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant’s breach, as
                        discerned from the material facts pleaded</em> (and of course,
                    evidence would be required at a subsequent stage to prove such material facts).
                    In the present case, taking the plaintiff’s pleaded position as it stands,
                    none of the material facts that related to any of those losses were pleaded, nor
                    was such facts alleged or submitted throughout the proceedings before
                me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Instead, the only <em>material
                        facts</em> that discern any viable loss and damage <b><em>suffered by the plaintiff as a result of</em></b> the defendant’s
                    unfair dismissal or dismissal in bad faith, <b><em>as
                        pleaded</em></b>, would be that the unfair dismissal or dismissal in bad
                    faith had deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity to receive a variable bonus
                    known as the “incentive compensation”. This is analogous to the
                        <em>Latham Scott</em> situation where the employee
                    claimed that the dismissal in bad faith had wrongfully deprived the employee the
                    chance to earn his discretionary bonus. In the present case, the plaintiff
                    pleaded that (see Reply at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the Plaintiff had expressed that the <em>manner</em> in which she was being terminated is <em>unfair</em>, especially given her many years of
                        contribution to the Defendant, the manner in which she was targeted to
                        leave, how her annual leave balance was adjusted to reflect only up till
                        31 January 2011 even though the Plaintiff’s employ had not been
                        terminated at the point of time, and the fact that the <em>ex
                            gratia payment of S$40,000 offered in the 17 January Letter would,
                            in any case, have been due from the Defendant to her as part of her
                            incentive compensation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff considered that the
                    defendant’s offer of <em>ex gratia</em> payment of
                    S$40,000 would have, in any case, been due from the defendant to her as part of
                    her incentive compensation. When the defendant queried what was the basis upon
                    which the plaintiff allege that she is entitled to the incentive compensation,
                    the plaintiff pleaded that she has been receiving the incentive compensation for
                    the past 10 years, and that s<em>he would have received it if her
                        employment had not been terminated</em> (see Further and Better
                    Particulars dated 29 April 2011 at answer number 3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[The Plaintiff] has been receiving incentive compensation for the past
                        10 years in or about February of each year and [she] was of the view that
                        she would have been given such incentive compensation in or about February
                        2011 <em>if her employment with the Defendant had not been
                            terminated</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In other words, according to the plaintiff,
                    the unfair dismissal and/or dismissal in bad faith had deprived the plaintiff of
                    the opportunity to earn the incentive compensation (which she would have
                    allegedly received if not for the termination). In the hearing before me, the
                    plaintiff’s counsel also submitted, in the same vein, that the plaintiff
                    would have received the incentive compensation but for the defendant’s
                    unfair termination of employment. However, the plaintiff made two material
                    admissions which have severe consequences on their claim. The plaintiff pleaded
                    the following (see Further and Better Particulars dated 29 April 2011 at
                    answer number 1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff <b><em>did not claim that it was her
                            right</em></b> to receive the incentive compensation <b><em>or that her right to the incentive compensation arises out of
                            any contractual obligation on the part of the Defendant</em></b>. [The
                        Plaintiff] has said...that the <em>ex gratia</em>
                        payment of S$40,000 offered in 17 January Letter would have included the
                        incentive compensation due from the Defendant to her. [Emphasis added in
                        bold italics].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff admitted that she has no right
                    to receive the incentive compensation, and that the defendant has no contractual
                    obligation to pay the incentive compensation to the plaintiff. At this juncture,
                    it is apposite to set out several settled principles relating to the award of
                    damages in a breach of an employment contract. The Court of Appeal in <em>Latham Scott</em> held (at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principle is that damages for breach of contract are awarded
                        as a compensation to the plaintiff for the damage, loss or injury he has
                        suffered through that breach. He is to be placed in the same position as it
                        the contract had been performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It has been elegantly opined in Selwyn’s
                    Law of Employment (16<sup>th</sup> ed, Oxford University Press
                    2011) at para [16.21]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principle in contract law (and it must be remembered that
                        employment law is basically concerned with a <em>contract</em> of employment) is that the purpose of damages is to
                        put the innocent party in the position in which he would have been had the
                            <em>contractual obligations</em> been performed,
                        insofar as it is possible to do this by a monetary award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the present case, and as explained above in
                        <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>, based on the plaintiff’s
                        <b><em>pleaded case</em></b>, the only material facts that
                    discern any viable loss and damage that she would have suffered from the unfair
                    dismissal and/or dismissal in bad faith was the deprivation of her opportunity
                    to earn the incentive compensation. Yet in the very same breath, found in the
                    same set of pleadings, the plaintiff conceded that there is no contractual
                    entitlement to the incentive compensation. In effect, the payment of incentive
                    compensation would be in the defendant’s absolute goodwill and discretion.
                    As such, taking the plaintiff’s pleaded case at its highest (that is,
                    assuming <em>arguendo</em> that her claim in unfair manner
                    of dismissal, and dismissal in bad faith is successful), the defendant’s
                    unfair dismissal and dismissal in bad faith <b><em>had not deprived
                        the plaintiff of anything that she was contractually entitled to</em></b>.
                    In view of the material admissions, <em>even if the plaintiff had
                        continued to be employed by the defendant</em>; and on the other hand,
                    even if the defendant had terminated the contract of employment in good faith,
                    or if the defendant had performed a fair manner of dismissing the
                    plaintiff’s employment, the plaintiff <b><em>would still not
                        be contractually entitled to the incentive compensation</em></b>, much
                    less when her employment was terminated in accordance with the express terms of
                    the contract, with payment of more than one month’s salary in lieu of
                    notice. (I add here parenthetically, that it also does not lie in the
                    plaintiff’s mouth to claim that she is entitled to the <em>ex gratia</em> payments of S$40,000 and S$75,000, as it is beyond
                    doubted that she had rejected these two offers from the defendant, as admitted
                    in her pleadings.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The present situation is analogous to that in
                        <em>Latham Scott</em>, where the employee
                    (“Latham”) claimed that he was wrongfully dismissed and that the
                    employer had owed him a guaranteed bonus of almost US$2m. Latham also claimed
                    that the dismissal made in bad faith had deprived him of the opportunity to earn
                    the bonus. The Court of Appeal considered whether Latham would have been
                    entitled to a discretionary bonus if he had not been dismissed from the company.
                    The relevant clause of Latham's employment contract stated that "a bonus may be
                    paid to you at the end of each calendar year, based on Company profitability and
                    your performance during the year". The Court of Appeal observed that the bonus
                    payment was entirely discretionary. Even if Latham had continued to be employed
                    at the company, he would not have had a legal right to claim a bonus from the
                    company (at [71]-[72]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    In our view, it would be wrong to allow an employee
                            in Latham's position to lay claim to a discretionary bonus on a proper
                            construction of his employment contract when his services were
                            terminated even before his bonus was properly declared. In both
                                <em>Walz v Barings Services Ltd</em>, a
                            preliminary hearing before the English Industrial Tribunal, and
                                <em>Bajor v Citibank International plc</em>
                            (Queen's Bench Division, 19 February 1998, unreported), the plaintiffs
                            were employed in an industry in which the employees operated within a
                            'bonus culture' in which bonuses were very commonly and even invariably
                            paid. However, both plaintiffs were held not to be entitled to claim the
                            bonus as a matter of contractual obligation after being dismissed, even
                            if they were wrongfully dismissed as in the case of <em>Bajor v Citibank International plc</em>. In <em>Walz v Barings Services Ltd</em>, this was so even
                            though the bonus had already been announced by the respondents. It was
                            held there that, as the bonus was totally discretionary, there was
                            simply no obligation to pay. Announcing it did not convert the payment
                            of the bonus into a contractual obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Latham's situation was akin to the plaintiffs in
                            these two cases. Unless the bonus had been expressed to be guaranteed,
                            an employee in Latham's position could not claim to be legally entitled
                            to a bonus, the granting and quantum of which are entirely at the
                            discretion of the employer. While he might have hoped for a bonus if he
                            had indeed remained in the employ of CSFB, the fact remained that, even
                            then, he would not have been able to claim to be entitled to a bonus as
                            of right as it was entirely at the discretion of CSFB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As the payment of bonus was found to be
                    entirely within the employer’s discretion in <em>Latham
                        Scott</em>, the “incentive compensation” in the present
                    case would <em>a fortiori</em> be found to be within the
                    defendant’s absolute discretion. There is nothing in the plaintiff’s
                    employment contract that guarantees the incentive compensation. Furthermore, the
                    clause in Latham’s employment contract tagged the payment of bonus to the
                    employee’s performance as well as the employer’s profitability for
                    that given year, and yet the Court of Appeal still found the payment of bonus to
                    be entirely within the employer’s discretion. In the present case, given
                    that clause 3 of the plaintiff’s letter of appointment merely states
                    “you <em>may</em> be paid a <em>discretionary</em> variable bonus equivalent to one month’s
                    gross salary, and proportionately in respect of any incomplete year of
                    service”, where the payment of bonus is expressed to be discretionary,
                    and where it is not tagged to the performance of the employee or the
                    employer’s profitability (unlike the situation in <em>Latham Scott</em>), it must be all the more so that the payment of
                    incentive compensation is in the employer’s absolute
                discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Notwithstanding the reference to the decision
                    of <em>Latham Scott</em> above, the present situation is
                    unlike that in <em>Latham Scott</em> where the Court has to
                    determine whether the payment of bonus was discretionary. There was no such need
                    in the present case, as the plaintiff had effectively <b><em>conceded</em></b> (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> -
                        <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above) that there is no contractual
                    basis for the payment of the incentive compensation, and that the payment of
                    such is entirely within the defendant’s discretion. In this regard, the
                    plaintiff’s admissions have rendered the claim inescapably and
                    fundamentally flawed. The claim is, in essence, a “<em>non-claim</em>”, <em>in so far as</em>
                    she has admitted that the defendant’s breach did not deprive her of
                    anything that she was contractually entitled to. Given that the plaintiff is
                        <b><em>already placed in the position she would have been in if
                        the termination had not been made in bad faith or made unfairly</em></b>
                    (with the payment to the plaintiff of more than one month’s salary in lieu
                    of notice, and with the plaintiff’s material concession that, even if the
                    contract of employment was not terminated, she would not in any case be
                    contractually entitled to the incentive compensation (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>, <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>
                    above)), the continuance of the plaintiff’s claim in trial would therefore
                    achieve <b><em>no practical or useful purpose other than to advance
                        the plaintiff’s collateral interests</em></b> in pursuing against
                    the defendant to pay her more than what she was contractually entitled to under
                    her employment contract. For the reasons above, the claim is struck out as it is
                    frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The plaintiff’s claim is struck out with
                    costs. I will hear parties’ submissions on costs at a later
                date.</p>
