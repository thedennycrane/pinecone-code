The terms of these contracts permitted the defendant to advise the plaintiff on a delivery date and/or a port of destination for the equipment ordered. Subsequently, the equipment which had been contracted for was never delivered. The plaintiff alleges that its failure to deliver was caused by the defendant’s repudiatory breaches of implied terms of the contracts in dispute. The alleged implied terms include (a) a term requiring the defendant to advise the plaintiff on a delivery date within a reasonable time; and (b) a term requiring the defendant to nominate a port of destination within a reasonable time, that was sufficiently early to allow the plaintiff to effect delivery by the agreed delivery date. The defendant counterclaims that the plaintiff had wrongly terminated the contracts in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The key questions in this case, therefore, are whether the alleged implied terms exist, whether the defendant was in breach of these terms and whether the defendant’s breach of these implied terms entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contracts. Having considered the evidence and the submissions before me, I find that the plaintiff succeeds in its claim, and I dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim in its entirety. </span>I set out the reasons for my decision below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff is a Singapore-incorporated company.

The first group – comprising seven contracts brought into issue by the plaintiff’s claim (POs 9968, 9969, 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290, 11651) and two contracts brought into issue by the defendant’s counterclaim (POs 8874 and 8875) – consists of contracts for which there are, allegedly, mutually-agreed delivery dates. The second group consists only of the contract evidenced by PO 10601, for which it is undisputed that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> mutually agreed delivery date.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The plaintiff relies on two English cases in support of this argument. In the first case, <span class="font-italic">Tsakiroglou</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Ltd v Transgrains, SA </span>[1958] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 562 (“<span class="font-italic">Tsakiroglou</span>”), the sellers contracted to sell 500 tons of groundnuts to the buyers. Shipment was to take place in November 1956, on a “c.i.f. basis freight rate Hamburg/Rotterdam”. Both the sellers and the buyers understood this to mean that the buyers had the option of choosing Hamburg or Rotterdam as the port of destination. However, the buyers only informed the sellers of its nomination on 5 November 1956, whereupon the sellers cancelled the contract. When the buyers subsequently made a claim for non-delivery, the sellers submitted that the contract was subject to an implied condition that the buyers had to nominate the port to which the goods were to be shipped, and that this nomination had to be made known to the seller a reasonable time <span class="font-italic">before</span> the first day of the shipment period. McNair J agreed with the sellers’ submissions and held (at 572): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t seems to me to be abundantly plain that this contract simply will not work unless the sellers are informed by the buyers as to whether or not, and how, their option is going to be exercised … It is plain that, if the nomination … is not given to [the buyers] by a day or two before Nov. 1, they cannot perform, and they are really being deprived of part of their rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the second case, <span class="font-italic">Mansel</span><span class="font-italic"> Oil Ltd and another v Troon Storage Tankers SA (The “Ailsa Craig”) </span>[2008] EWHC 1269 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Mansel</span><span class="font-italic"> Oil (HC)</span>”), the defendant owners contracted to charter their vessel to the claimant charterers, and the agreed delivery date was 15 November 2007. When the owners failed to deliver the vessel by the agreed delivery date, the charterers brought a claim against them. One of the issues was whether the charterers were entitled to cancel the charterparty by reason of the owner’s failure to nominate a delivery port. Clarke J held (at [49]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [O]wners and charterers would ordinarily understand that charterers’ option to select the delivery port was an option that they were <span class="font-italic">obliged </span>to exercise. The expectation of the parties is that the charterer <span class="font-italic">will</span> declare where the vessel is to be delivered, not that he <span class="font-italic">may</span> do so. Further, the nomination is necessary in order to complete the definition of the parties’ contractual obligations. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 On the question of <span class="font-italic">when </span>such an obligation arose, the learned judge held (at [56]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t was for charterers to make their nomination within a reasonable time which would be such time as was (a) not so late as would mean that, because of the lateness of the nomination, the vessel could not make her cancelling; and (b) early enough to ensure that the vessel suffered no delay resulting from the absence of nomination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 These propositions were subsequently upheld on appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Mansel</span><span class="font-italic"> Oil Limited, Vitol S.A. v Troon Storage Tankers SA </span>[2009] EWCA Civ 425). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having considered the authorities above, I agree with the plaintiff’s submission and find that the contracts evidenced by POs 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290, 11651, 8874 and 8875 were subject to an implied term that the defendant would nominate a port of destination within a reasonable time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a point of time which was sufficiently early to enable the plaintiff to deliver the goods ordered by September 2013 (for PO 8874), October 2013 (for PO 8875) and January 2017 (for POs 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290 and 11651). Although <span class="font-italic">Mansel</span><span class="font-italic"> Oil (HC) </span>did not frame the charterer’s “obligation to nominate” as an implied term of the contract, I am of the view that the case is nevertheless helpful for the general proposition that a party to a contract who has been offered the option of nominating the port of destination must do so within a reasonable time in order to ensure the business efficacy of that contract. I also find that the plaintiff’s formulation of the term to be implied satisfies the officious bystander test (<span class="font-italic">viz., </span>the third requirement of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>test outlined at [27] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The position in relation to the contracts evidenced by POs 9968 and 9969 is slightly more complex. As a matter of logic, a term of this nature can only be implied if the parties have <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>agreed on a date of delivery. This is because the point of time at which the obligation to nominate arises must be defined by reference to an agreed delivery date. However, the parties have taken diametrically opposing positions regarding the existence of agreed delivery dates under POs 9968 and 9969. While the plaintiff alleges that the parties were able to agree on the delivery dates for both contracts during a meeting on 9 April 2016, the defendant argues that these dates were never agreed upon. Rather, its position is that both contracts were mutually terminated on that date, and that any subsequent allusions to delivery dates for Hulls 1610 and 1611 were made only in reference to a <span class="font-italic">proposed</span> revised contract which the parties never concluded.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the contracts evidenced by POs 9968 and 9969 were <span class="font-italic">not</span> mutually terminated on 9 April 2016. Rather, the contemporaneous evidence strongly suggests that the parties agreed on “May 2017” and “July 2017” as the delivery dates for the contracts evidenced by POs 9968 and 9969 respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, the defendant relies on an e-mail dated 6 April 2016 sent by one of its employees, Mr Gary Quah (“Gary Quah”), to Ho Kah Huat (“Ho”), the plaintiff’s General Manager of Power Systems. The e-mail states that “[Quah Peng Wah] had given an instruction to terminate [POs 9968 and 9969] with [the plaintiff]”.

They are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the defendant was permitted, by way of an implied term or a “course of dealing”, to postpone delivery under the contracts in accordance with its ship construction schedule; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the inclusion of the phrase “TBA by POET” in the POs issued by the defendant meant that the defendant had an unfettered right to postpone the delivery date from time to time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In respect of the first subsidiary issue, I echo my reasoning at [67]-[69] above. I find that the defendant has not discharged its burden of showing that there was any term (whether implied or incorporated by course of dealing) which allowed the defendant to unilaterally extend the delivery dates without the plaintiff’s prior consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I now turn to the second subsidiary issue, which concerns the legal effect of the phrase “TBA by POET”. In this regard, I find Vinodh Coomaraswamy J’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 409 (“<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>”) to be particularly instructive. The plaintiff in that case had sued the defendant for failing to meet a delivery deadline. Coomaraswamy J held (at [46]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I acknowledge that the words “final date to be advised” are curious given the prior unequivocal statement that the delivery deadline would be changed to end-January 2012 … But <span class="font-italic">I am unable to accept the defendant’s contention that the words “final date to be advised” </span><span class="font-italic">thereby negate the otherwise-clear agreement between the parties as at 31 May 2011 that the deadline for delivery would be end-January 2012, ie, 31 January 2012</span>. At most, these words were intended to reassure the defendant that it would not unilaterally bring the delivery date forward and to indicate to the defendant a possibility that the plaintiff might at some future time agree with the defendant a further delay in the delivery deadline. The plaintiff never reached any such agreement with the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I agree with the plaintiff that the inclusion of the phrase “TBA by POET” in the POs issued by the defendant did not negate the parties’ <span class="font-italic">subsequent </span>unequivocal agreement that delivery for POs 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290, 11651, 8874 and 8875 would take place by January 2017. In my judgment, the phrase “TBA by POET” only indicated that the defendant had the right to elect a delivery date at some future time after the date of contract.

The plaintiff’s pleadings did not specify whether it was relying on any of the four situations set out at [76] above. In its closing submissions, however, the plaintiff’s case became clearer: it advanced the argument that the implied term requiring the defendant to nominate a port of destination within a reasonable time was a <span class="font-italic">condition</span> of the contract. The defendant’s actions thus constituted a “Situation 3(a)” breach which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I do not think that the plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the defendant had committed a “Situation 2” breach.  Firstly, although “Situation 2” breaches are sometimes referred to as “repudiatory” breaches (see for example, <span class="font-italic">San International Pte Ltd (formerly known as San Ho Huat Construction Pte Ltd) v Keppel Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 447 at [20]), I am of the view that the plaintiff intended for the term “repudiatory breach” to be interpreted in its broader sense, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as a type of breach which would entitle the plaintiff to terminate the contract. In other words, the plaintiff was simply characterising the defendant’s breach as one which fell within<span class="font-italic"> any</span> of the four situations set out at [76] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Furthermore, a “Situation 2” breach entails a <span class="font-italic">complete </span>renunciation of the contract by the party in breach. This was elaborated upon in the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Hugh Beale ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (at 24-018), which was cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Econ Piling Pte Ltd v GTE Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2009] SGHC 213 (at [30]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… An <span class="font-italic">absolute refusal</span> by one party to perform his side of the contract will entitle the other party to treat himself as discharged, as will also <span class="font-italic">a clear and unambiguous assertion by one party that he will be unable to perform</span> when the time for performance should arrive. Short of such an express refusal or declaration, however, the test is to ascertain whether the action or actions of the party in default are such as to lead a reasonable person to conclude that he <span class="font-italic">no longer intends to </span><span class="font-italic">be bound by its provision</span>s … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In my judgment, “evinc[ing] an inability to comply with” a contract cannot be equated with an “absolute refusal” by one party to perform his side of the contract. Nor can it be regarded as a “clear and unambiguous assertion” by the contract-breaker that he will be unable to perform the contract <span class="font-italic">in its totality</span>, or that he no longer intends to be bound by the contractual provisions. Thus, I disagree that the plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the defendant had committed a “Situation 2” breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The defendant’s second objection rests on the following passage in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (at [54]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am also satisfied that this was not a breach of a condition. I find that the varied delivery deadline was not a condition because of the words “final date to be advised” in the e-mail dated 31 May 2011. As I have said at [47] above, these words do not negate a finding that the delivery deadline was end-January 2012. But <span class="font-italic">they do indicate that the parties at the time did not view the deadline as a term so important that exceeding it by even a day would entitle the plaintiff to terminate the contract</span>. Those words suggest a mutual understanding at the time that there was a more than fanciful possibility of the parties agreeing to a further delay in delivery at some future time. To that extent, parties did envisage at the time a degree of flexibility in the deadline, such flexibility to be achieved by future agreement. For this reason, the stipulated delivery deadline could not have been of such importance to the parties at the time as to qualify as a condition of PO 1.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 These remarks<span class="font-italic"> </span>must be understood in their proper context. In <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>, the words “final date to be advised” were mentioned in the <span class="font-italic">same e-mail </span>as the agreed delivery date. The relevant portions of the e-mail read as follows (at [46]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hi Mr Tanabalan, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Please note!

If the innocent party chooses to exercise this right by <span class="font-italic">affirming </span>the contract, he is said to have waived his right to terminate the contract on the grounds of the same breach. This is the concept of waiver by election (see <span class="font-italic">Chai Cher Watt (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) v SDL Technologies Pte Ltd and another </span>[2012] 1 SLR 152 at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The test for waiver by election is well-established.

</div> I am not satisfied that such conduct constitutes an <span class="font-italic">unequivocal </span>representation by the plaintiff that it had elected to affirm the contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In this regard, I draw guidance from the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 (at [58]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Next, it is well established that mere silence or inaction will not normally amount to an unequivocal representation: <span class="font-italic">Foo</span><span class="font-italic">k Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo</span><span class="font-italic">k Gee Finance</span>”) at [36]. However, as we also observed in <span class="font-italic">Foo</span><span class="font-italic">k Gee Finance </span>(at [37]), “in certain circumstances, particularly where there is a duty to speak, mere silence may amount to [such] a representation”. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal then elaborated on the circumstances in which a “duty to speak” might arise (at [61]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">The expression “duty to speak” does not refer to a legal duty as such, but to circumstances in which a failure to speak would lead a reasonable party to think that the other party has elected between two inconsistent rights or will forbear to enforce a particular right in the future, as the case may be</span>. We emphasise that this is not the subjective assessment of the other party but an objective assessment made by reference to how a reasonable person apprised of the relevant facts would view the silence in the circumstances, though unsurprisingly, the parties’ relationship and the applicable law which governs it will be a critical focus of the court’s assessment of whether those circumstances exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It must be emphasised that cases in which a “duty to speak” arises are the exception and not the norm. Although the parties in the present case shared a longstanding business relationship, they were ultimately no more than commercial entities engaged in a series of arms-length transactions. In my assessment, there was nothing exceptional about their relationship or course of dealings which gave rise to a “duty to speak” on the plaintiff’s part, and the defendant did not adduce any evidence to persuade me otherwise. As such, I find that the plaintiff’s “accommodating” conduct alone cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence of its intention to affirm the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The defendant also submits that the plaintiff, through e-mails dated 13 and 16 February 2017, made “clear unequivocal written and express representations” that delivery of the equipment under the contracts could be discussed as long as the defendant settled its other outstanding sums.

Moreover, Ho caveated that the outcomes of these discussions would be subject to the plaintiff’s management’s approval.

Nevertheless, I am of the view that the defendant cannot avail itself of this defence even if its case is taken at its highest. Firstly, as stated at [90] above, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff had clearly and unequivocally represented to the defendant that it would not discharge the contracts. Secondly, even if the first element is made out, the defendant has neither particularised nor led evidence to prove the detriment which it has allegedly suffered in consequence of its reliance on the plaintiff’s conduct. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to consider this submission further. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether the plaintiff was required to give the defendant reasonable notice before terminating the contracts </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Finally, I come to the defendant’s contention that the plaintiff could not terminate the contracts without providing the defendant with reasonable prior notice of its intention to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 This argument rests on two limbs. First, the defendant relies on Clause 17 of the Orgalime S2000 General Conditions for the Supply of Mechanical, Electrical and Electronic Products which were incorporated into the quotations corresponding to POs 9968 and 9969.

</div> This clause reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless the Purchaser’s failure to accept delivery is due to any such circumstance as mentioned in Clause 39, the Supplier may by notice in writing require the Purchaser to accept delivery within a final reasonable period. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If, for any reason for which the Supplier is not responsible, the Purchaser fails to accept delivery within such period, the Supplier <span class="font-italic">may </span><span class="font-italic">by notice in writing terminate the contract in whole or in part</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I note that this point does not form part of the defendant’s pleadings. In any event, I agree with the plaintiff that the defendant’s reliance on this clause is misplaced. This clause merely specifies an optional <span class="font-italic">mode</span> by which the supplier <span class="font-italic">may </span>choose to terminate the contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>“by notice in writing”. It does not suggest that the supplier must give prior<span class="font-italic"> </span>notice to the defendant before terminating the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The defendant also relies on <span class="font-italic">Charles Rickards v </span><span class="font-italic">Oppenhaim </span>[1950] 1 K.B. 616 (“<span class="font-italic">Charles Rickards</span>”) for the proposition that the plaintiff was obliged to provide it with reasonable notice before terminating the contracts evidenced by POs 9968, 9969, 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290, 11651, 8874 and 8875. In that case, the defendant buyer ordered a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith chassis from the plaintiff suppliers. When the car was not delivered on the agreed delivery date, the buyer did not cancel the contract but continued to press for delivery. Eventually, the buyer gave a notice to the supplier stating that he would not accept the car unless it was delivered by 25 July 1948. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Denning LJ (as he then was) held (at 623) that the buyer was estopped, by its initial conduct, from terminating the contract on the grounds of the supplier’s late delivery:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the defendant, as he did, led the plaintiffs to believe that he would not insist on the stipulation as to time, and that, if they carried out the work, he would accept it, and they did it, he could not afterwards set up the stipulation as to the time against them. Whether it be called waiver or forbearance on his part, or an agreed variation or substituted performance, does not matter. It is a kind of estoppel. By his conduct he evinced an intention to affect their legal rights. He made, in effect, a promise not to insist on his strict legal rights. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 However, Denning LJ also went on to stress that if the buyer subsequently gave notice to the supplier fixing a reasonable time for delivery, thus making time of the essence once again, it would be entitled to terminate the contract if delivery was not fulfilled by the new time stipulated (at 624): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would be most unreasonable if the defendant, having been lenient and waived the initial expressed time, should, by so doing, have prevented himself from ever thereafter insisting on reasonably quick delivery. In my judgment he was entitled to give a reasonable notice making time of the essence of the matter. Adequate protection to the suppliers is given by the requirement that the notice should be reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Charles Rickards </span>only assists the defendant’s case if it succeeds in proving that the plaintiff had waived its right to, or was estopped from, terminating the contract by reason of the defendant’s failure to nominate a port of destination within a reasonable time. As established above, however, neither waiver nor estoppel are made out in the present case. I thus find that the plaintiff had validly exercised its right to terminate the contracts evidenced by POs 9968, 9969, 9992, 10600, 11289, 11290, 11651, 8874 and 8875. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues concerning the contract evidenced by PO 10601</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the contract was subject to an implied term that the defendant would advise the plaintiff on a delivery date within a reasonable time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I now turn to the issues surrounding the contract evidenced by PO 10601. The plaintiff acknowledges that the parties did not, at any point in time, agree on a delivery date for this contract. Instead, its case is that the contract was subject to an implied term that the defendant would advise the plaintiff on a delivery date within a reasonable time from the date of contract. It further submits that a “reasonable time” would have been a maximum of 2 years from the contract, based on the previous course of dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I agree with the plaintiff that the contract evidenced by PO 10601 was subject to an implied term that the defendant would advise the plaintiff on a delivery date within a reasonable time. In my view, the implication of such a term meets the requirements of the three-step <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>test for the implication of terms set out at [27] above. As the plaintiff has pointed out, the terms of the contracts were such that 90% of the contract price would only become payable upon delivery of the equipment ordered. Thus, for as long as the defendant withheld advising the plaintiff on a delivery date, the plaintiff would not have been able to deliver and therefore would not have become entitled to the remaining 90% of the contract price. In my view, this was clearly a “gap” which the plaintiff and the defendant had failed to contemplate, and which needed to be addressed in order for the contract to make commercial sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I am also unable to accept the defendant’s allegation that the equipment purchased under PO 10601 had been expressly purchased as “stock”. I accept Koh’s evidence that the word “stock” was not intended to mean that the plaintiff would purchase and store equipment for the defendant. Rather, it was used to signify a particular engine which had been ordered under a previous PO, but which had been transferred to a new hull and designated under a new PO with the plaintiff’s agreement.

</div>
</div> of the disputed contract in that case “expressly stipulated” that the respondent would be entitled to terminate the contract should the appellant in that case breach any item under clause 2.7. Since the appellant had breached clause 2.7.2 of the contract, the respondent’s right to terminate the contract “immediately arose” (see <span class="font-italic">Fu Yuan Foodstuff</span> at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The Court of Appeal also distinguished the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rice v Great Yarmouth Borough Council </span>[2003] TCLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Rice</span>”).  In <span class="font-italic">Rice</span>, the issue was whether a local council was entitled to terminate two maintenance contracts with a contractor on the basis of the following contractual term: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23.2 If the contractor: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23.2.1 commits a breach of any of its obligations under the Contract; … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the Council may, without prejudice to any accrued rights or remedies under the Contract, terminate the Contractor’s employment under the Contract by notice in writing having immediate effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Hale LJ (as she then was) (with whom Peter Gibson and May LJJ agreed) remarked that, on its face, the clause ostensibly “visit[ed] the same draconian consequences upon any breach, however small, of any obligation, however small”. In her view, “the notion that this term would entitle the council to terminate a contract such as this at any time for any breach of any term fl[ew] in the face of commercial common sense”. Accordingly, she affirmed the decision of the judge at first instance that Clause 23.2.1 only accorded a right to terminate in the event of a repudiatory breach, or an accumulation of breaches which, as a whole, could properly be described as repudiatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fu Yuan Foodstuff </span>characterised <span class="font-italic">Rice </span>as a case where a termination clause was artificially “read down” in order to control its legal effect. It declined to adopt the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Rice </span>because the contested termination clause in <span class="font-italic">Fu Yuan Foodstuff </span>was “consistent with the commercial reality between the parties” (at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In my view, the approach in <span class="font-italic">Rice </span>is similarly inapplicable in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Rice</span>, the contractor operated a small-scale horticultural business and was contracting with the local council for the first time. In addition, the contracts were intended to last for four years (a substantial duration) and involved a myriad of obligations of differing importance and varying frequency. By contrast, the defendant in this case is an established business entity which was involved in a longstanding commercial relationship with the plaintiff. The defendant was well-acquainted with the plaintiff’s Conditions of Sale, which were annexed to all of the plaintiff’s quotations. Moreover, the contract in dispute was not a long-term service contract, but a straightforward arms-length transaction for the purchase and delivery of shipbuilding equipment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In light of these circumstances, I am satisfied that the literal meaning of Clause 11, which <span class="font-italic">expressly </span>and <span class="font-italic">unambiguously</span> entitles the plaintiff to terminate the contract evidenced by PO 10601 if the defendant breaches “any” of its obligations (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether express or implied) to the plaintiff, accurately represented the parties’ intentions at the time of their entry into the contract. Like <span class="font-italic">Fu Yuan Foodstuff</span>, the present case falls within “Situation 1” of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([76] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Additionally, the <span class="font-italic">contra </span><span class="font-italic">proferentem </span>rule is only applicable in cases where there is doubt or ambiguity about the meaning of a particular contractual provision, and therefore does not assist the defendant in the present case (see <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1083 at [47]), since there is no ambiguity within Clause 11 itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I note in passing that the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Rice</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([124] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>has been widely critiqued (see for example, Simon Whittaker, “Termination Clauses” in <span class="font-italic">Contract Terms</span> (Andrew Burrows &amp; Edwin Peel eds) (Oxford University Press, 2007) at pp 277–283; Ewan McKendrick, <span class="font-italic">Contract Law</span><span class="font-italic">: Text, Cases and Materials </span>(Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2012) at pp 792-793). Furthermore, recent English decisions appear to suggest that contractual terms which expressly provide for a right of termination are effective even if the events on which those rights are exercisable do not amount to repudiatory breaches (see <span class="font-italic">Kason </span><span class="font-italic">Kek-Gardner Ltd v Process Components Ltd </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 2132; <span class="font-italic">Firodi</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping Ltd v Griffon Shipping LLC </span>[2013] EWCA Civ 1567). Nevertheless, it is not necessary for me to discuss the legal merits of the approach in <span class="font-italic">Rice</span>, and I do not propose to do so here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Although the analysis above is sufficient to dispose of this issue in its entirety, I will cursorily address the parties’ other submissions for completeness. These relate to the questions of (a) whether the implied term to advise on a delivery date within a reasonable time is a condition under Situation 3(a) in <span class="font-italic">RDC </span><span class="font-italic">Concrete</span>; and (b) whether breaching such a term would deprive the plaintiff of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, pursuant to Situation 3(b) in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Parties referred me to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Shawton</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering Ltd v DGP International Ltd </span>[2006] BLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Shawton</span>”), which Coomaraswamy J discussed at length in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>The relevant portion of <span class="font-italic">Shawton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  … In the present case, there were originally fixed dates for completion, but it is correctly agreed that variations had rendered those dates inoperable. <span class="font-italic">Instead, the obligation was to complete within a reasonable time.</span> That obligation did not depend on Shawton giving any notice.

As such, the aggrieved party can only terminate the contract if it has given reasonable notice making time of the essence, or if the breach was of such a nature as to deprive it of substantially the whole benefit of the contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a Situation 3(b) breach).

The concept of reasonableness in the context of mitigation is a flexible one. In essence, it bars an aggrieved party from profiting or behaving unreasonably at the expense of the defaulting party, and encapsulates complex interplaying notions of responsibility and fairness. As with any principle of law that encapsulates notions of fairness, the principle of mitigation confers on the courts considerable discretion in evaluating the facts of the case at hand in order to arrive at a commercially just determination. The principle embodies a fact-centric flexibility which, whilst remaining in harmony with sound business practice, stands in vivid contrast to the strictness with which rules in other areas of contract law are applied.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The plaintiff has led evidence by Ho to illustrate the steps which it has taken to sell the equipment under the contracts in dispute.
