The drugs were so well hidden that he could not have known about it unless he was told of it. His behaviour throughout, except at the time of arrest, had been consistent with a person who had no inkling of the presence of drugs in the Black Luggage. His explanation for his lies at the time of arrest was not unreasonable given the situation he found himself, including the fact that he was in a foreign land for the first time and unfamiliar with its laws and customs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The CA conviction decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Prosecution appealed against the acquittal of Ilechukwu by way of Criminal Appeal No 10 of 2014 (“CCA 10/2014”).

The Prosecution called one expert witness, psychiatrist Dr Christopher Cheok (“Dr Cheok”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Defence applied for the admission of sworn statements from two witnesses, Nzube Ilechukwu (“Nzube”) and Emeka Ikechukwu Ilechukwu (“Emeke”) under s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). They were both brothers of Ilechukwu who were called to give evidence of his childhood. Nzube lives in California, USA, having gone there in 2016. He stated in his affidavit that he was juggling between school and minimum wage jobs and could not afford to travel to Singapore to give evidence. Emeke lives in his home village in Nigeria and also could not afford to travel to Singapore to give evidence. Based on the evidence of Ilechukwu’s background, and the assertions made by Nzube and Emeke in their statements, I was satisfied that they were outside Singapore and that it was not practicable to secure their attendance in court to give evidence. As the evidence that they proposed to give were relevant to the inquiry before me, I admitted their sworn statements, which were notarised in California and Nigeria respectively. Ilechukwu called three psychiatrists to give evidence as experts: (a) Dr Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), (b) Dr Ken Ung (“Dr Ung”) and (c) Dr Sarkar. Together with the Prosecution’s psychiatrist, Dr Cheok, the four experts gave their evidence in conclave on 7 and 8 August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I set out in this judgment my findings on the matters remitted to me by the Court of Appeal in CA/CM 4/2017 and CA/CM 22/2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Wukari massacre</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The case for Ilechukwu turns on an incident that he claimed occurred when he was five to six years old.

Severity and course specifiers should be applied to denote the individual’s current presentation, but only when the full criteria are met. When full criteria are not met, clinicians should consider whether criteria for an “other specified” or “unspecified” designation…On the basis of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinical judgment, a final diagnosis is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I do not think that this meant that the use of “clinical judgment” should replace the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria.

For adults, both Criterion C and Criterion D symptoms must be satisfied. Under the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria (Childhood) for children, a person needs to manifest either symptom Criterion C or D to qualify for a PTSD diagnosis.

According to Ilechukwu, the Black Luggage was passed to him by an individual known as Kingsley.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Prosecution argued that the “Kingsley story” was false.

He was also arrested for drug trafficking in a separate operation. According to Adili, he saw Ilechukwu carrying a black luggage bag in the house of one Izuchukwu. Adili claimed that they both left Izuchukwu’s house with Ilechukwu carrying the black luggage bag.

</div> The Defence objected to the admission, and challenged the reliability of Adili’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I am unable to take into account Adili’s evidence for the following reasons.  Adili’s evidence was adduced to challenge the veracity of Ilechukwu’s version of the circumstances which preceded his arrest on 14 November 2011 in order to demonstrate that he was not telling the truth to the psychiatrists who examined him. The Prosecution argued that Adili’s evidence was relevant because it determined the reliability of Ilechukwu’s account to Dr Sarkar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I am unable to agree with this for the following reasons. Adili’s evidence would have been relevant in the original trial, which was the subject of <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span>, at which the veracity of Ilechukwu’s account could have been challenged in the appropriate manner. Had it been done at that trial, Adili’s evidence would have to be given at the committal hearing. The Defence would then have had notice of this challenge to Ilechukwu’s version of the events in Nigeria and have had the opportunity to prepare for the cross-examination of Adili. In addition, the Defence would also have had the opportunity to cross-examine other Prosecution witnesses as well as to call its own witnesses on this issue. The Prosecution did not do this at that trial. In my view, it is not proper for the Prosecution to adduce evidence from Adili on an important aspect of the Prosecution’s case in the trial even though it might be relevant on a subsidiary issue of the truth of Ilechukwu’s account to Dr Sarkar. In any event, without the Defence being given a full opportunity to challenge Adili’s evidence, it is not possible for me to make any finding on whether Adili’s evidence had affected the veracity of Ilechukwu’s account to Dr Sarkar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Prosecution also suggested that Ilechukwu’s alleged lies about his symptoms after the charge was read to him show that the possibility of Ilechukwu “malingering” his PTSD symptoms could not be excluded.

</div> I agree that symptoms suffered because of the Wukari massacre should not be used to diagnose Ilechukwu with PTSD arising out of the 2011 arrest, and vice-versa.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As regards the second objection, I find that both sides, including the Prosecution, were guilty of this approach. However, this approach of matching Ilechukwu’s evidence to particular criterion within the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria was largely a product of the diagnostic approach taken by Dr Sarkar and Dr Winslow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Neither Dr Sarkar nor Dr Winslow used the CAPS-5 diagnostic tool. The CAPS-5 diagnostic is a criterion-by-criterion questionnaire tying Ilechukwu’s responses to specific criterion under the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria. Only Dr Ung of the Defence used the CAPS-5 diagnostic. As a result, the Defence sometimes matched specific DSM-5 PTSD Criteria with statements made by Ilechukwu (either in the clinical interview or elsewhere), even when the expert did not expressly do so in their written medical reports or during the Remitted Hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I did not think it appropriate to disregard the Defence experts’ opinion simply because there was no statement of an express link between a particular symptom and the specific DSM-5 PTSD Criteria. My approach to this problem was to analyse whether the expert’s clinical observations were sufficiently and justifiably linked to the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria even though the specific DSM-5 PTSD Criterion was not expressly stated. It was sometimes apparent from the context that the Defence experts were in fact talking about the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria even though they did not expressly say so. In any case, I do not find it fatal to the Defence’s case that their experts did not always link their observations to the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I agree with the Prosecution’s third objection. The Defence was not entitled to construct its own “piecemeal” diagnosis of PTSD from the evidence of the various experts. Accordingly, I place no weight on the Defence’s attempts to construct its own “piecemeal” diagnosis of PTSD from the evidence of the various experts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Objectivity and reliability of the expert witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I do not agree with both the Prosecution and Defence’s attempts to undermine the credibility of the opposing experts.

Firstly, he premised this solely on Ilechukwu’s testimony in court and at the earlier trial (CC 32 of 2014). There would have been a stronger case had this conclusion been based on material gathered in his clinical interview with Ilechukwu. Secondly, it is not clear that Ilechukwu’s “persistent and exaggerated beliefs” were causally linked or attributable to the Wukari massacre. Evidence that Ilechukwu had such beliefs during childhood or early adulthood would have been more persuasive. This was not presented to the court. Thus, I could not rule out that Ilechukwu’s beliefs were caused by his arrest in 2011 and the events thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In relation to Criterion D7, Dr Sarkar was of the view that Ilechukwu’s lack of friends or romantic relationships demonstrated that he had a “persistent inability to experience positive emotions”. This conclusion seems reasonable. As for Criterion D6, Dr Sarkar concluded that this was made out by Ilechukwu’s feelings that there was “no one rushing to help him”. I am not certain how this conclusion follows from those feelings which relate to a sense of abandonment rather estrangement or detachment. Lastly, Dr Sarkar’s opinion that Criterion D5 was satisfied is questionable as it is not clear that his refusal to eat or drink was attributable to the Wukari massacre. It seems to be that this symptom was due to Ilechukwu’s 2011 arrest than to the traumatic Wukari massacre.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Ung</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Dr Ung stated that the following criteria were satisfied:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D2 as Ilechukwu displayed strong negative feelings about the world, stating “the world is not okay…I don’t know how to explain”.

The fact that this evidence was not independently corroborated cannot prevent the court from coming to a conclusion based on what is available before it. The only issue is the quality of the evidence in support of and against the proposition. In that regard, due consideration must be given to the fact that the evidence of Ilechukwu’s brothers was admitted without the benefit of cross-examination.

His mother, who would probably be the best person to give such evidence in the absence of evidence from medical professionals, was not available to give evidence on his behalf. The DSM-5 PTSD Criteria guide the psychiatrist in coming to a diagnosis of mental illness for the purpose of deciding on the course of treatment of that patient. On the other hand, the purpose of the forensic analysis in court is to determine questions of fact.

</div> None of the Defence experts explained how being verbally told that he would face the death penalty was an event which satisfied Criterion A. No expert evidence was adduced to support the claim that a verbal warning like this could constitute the requisite degree of trauma. I therefore find that the Defence has not proven the existence of the Criterion A traumatic event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 There is, nonetheless, some evidence that Ilechukwu suffered from specified PTSS after his arrest on 14 November 2011. Given that the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria prescribes that all eight criteria must be satisfied to constitute a positive PTSD diagnosis, and that I have already found Criterion A to be absent, it is clear that Ilechukwu did not suffer from a fresh episode of PTSD in relation to the 2011 events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I now proceed to analyse whether Ilechukwu suffered from PTSS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether Ilechukwu was suffering from PTSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 All the experts agreed that Ilechukwu suffered from at least some PTSS at some point in time.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I did not find the Prosecution’s witnesses to be helpful in shedding light on the circumstances of the arrest and the recording of the Pocketbook Statement. It was clear that they did not have specific recollection of the events that took place on the morning of 14 November 2011 and were relying on what was recorded in the Investigation Diary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I recognise, however, that if something completely out of the ordinary had happened, it would have been recorded in the Investigation Diary. An indication of this was Ilechukwu’s refusal to have his lunch at 1.48pm on the day of the arrest. This showed that he was sufficiently distressed to refuse food, even though he had not eaten anything since at least the previous night, as he was awakened by the front desk in the morning. This is not inconsistent with his position that he was under “intense or prolonged psychological distress”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 A close examination of Ilechukwu’s testimony (see above at [140] and [141]) reveals that he did suffer from some form of “fear” at the time of the arrest. It is possible that this fear was causally related to the Wukari massacre, based on Ilechukwu’s description of his arrest as a “war” with “everyone scattering”, and that the arrest itself provided either a cue that “symbolised or resembled an aspect of the traumatic” Wukari massacre. But it is equally possible that he was fearful because he was under arrest. The fact that this took place in a strange country would amplify the fear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 On the question whether Ilechukwu was exaggerating his perception of the arrest during his testimony in the trial of CC 32 of 2014, I am not inclined to think that he was. There was no reason for him to do so because PTSD was not contemplated at the time. Further, the Prosecution did not dispute the essential parts of his narrative, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> that the CNB officers had burst into his room and that he was immediately pinned down and handcuffed before he was informed of anything.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Weighing the evidence, I find, on balance, that it showed that Ilechukwu was suffering from “intense psychological distress” at the time when the Pocketbook Statement was recorded. I note that the Pocketbook Statement was recorded about two hours after Ilechukwu’s arrest at 11.14am on 14 November 2011. I took this to be sufficiently contemporaneous such that whatever symptoms suffered by Ilechukwu at the time of the arrest would have still been present when the Pocketbook Statement was recorded. Thus, I find that the Criterion B4 symptom was made out at the time the Pocketbook Statement was recorded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">During the recording of the Cautioned Statement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The Defence submitted that Ilechukwu suffered from the following symptoms during the recording of the Cautioned Statement:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Criterion B3: Dissociative reactions;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Criterion B4: Intense and prolonged psychological distress;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Criterion D4: Persistent negative emotional state (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, fear); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Criterion E5: Problems with concentration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">B3: Dissociative reactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I note that Dr Sarkar’s report stated that Ilechukwu suffered from “dissociative symptoms, which commenced after arrest when he became aware of death penalty”.

I reproduce the relevant excerpts from Dr Sarkar’s report in their entirety:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43. When asked what he meant by the term ‘lost’ he said ‘I was very frightened. I was in shock. Even the CNB officers who saw me outside after this asked what is wrong and said I should trust the legal system as Singapore has a very fair system of justice.’ He said he felt really weak, and was very hungry, his last meal being over a day and half earlier. He said he just ‘lie down on floor’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. He said over the following few days he could not think ‘like a human’, which he clarified meant he could not think logically. He said ‘For seven days they kept me. It was so cold. I have never shivered so much in my life. I lie on the floor and saw my life leaving me. I was dying’. When asked what he meant by it, he said he felt he was out of his body looking at himself lying on the floor and feeling that his ‘life was leaving me’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45. He said during the next few days the only contact he had with the outside world was ‘when they came to do spot-checks and to ask me to sign if I did not want to eat. I did not eat much at all’, he said…They say the temperature is fixed. They could not give me blankets when I asked.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46. He said food, drinks and toilet breaks were provided and denied any coercion on part of interrogators. He claimed that he was in shock, had no appetite, and could not sleep because of the cold and ‘Awu’ (an Igbo word that the interpreter said means intense fear). He described himself to be ‘not feeling like a human’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48. He said for a week before he made the long statements he ruminated about death and dying. He claimed that the ‘main officer’ who was interrogating him had said ‘You are lying. You will hang’ and was convinced his life was in immediate danger. He said that he therefore ‘lied a lot’ as he did not wish to die …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49. …I could not link black luggage and Maria with 2 packets of drugs and Hamida.

He sat transfixed and gently kept shaking his head. Then he sobbed loudly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 From the above, I accept that Dr Sarkar was suggesting that Ilechukwu was suffering from Criterion B4, D2 and D4 symptoms at the time when the Long Statements were recorded during his remand despite the fact that the observations were not explicitly linked to these symptoms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Thus, taking the above into account, the only symptoms which were supported by an expert’s opinion – in this case, Dr Sarkar – are Criterion B4, D2, and D4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The Defence cited Ilechukwu’s testimony at trial in CC 32 of 2014 as further supporting Dr Sarkar’s opinion.

</div>
</div> I disagree on this point as I already found that Dr Sarkar expressed the opinion that B4 was satisfied (although not by way of an express statement in his report) (see above at [167]). On balance, I find that there was evidence that Ilechukwu was suffering from “intense psychological distress” during the period in which he was placed in remand. The words which Ilechukwu used to describe his period of remand are extreme and forceful, implying a degree of intensity which was out of the ordinary. Furthermore, Ilechukwu’s recollection of his time in Cantonment was made in the trial of CC 32 of 2014. I did not think it likely that Ilechukwu was exaggerating his mental conditions experienced during the stint in remand at the time of the 2014 trial. The evidence given by Ilechukwu in the trial of CC 32 of 2014 is also broadly consistent with Ilechukwu’s self-reported symptoms to Dr Sarkar in the First Sarkar Report of 6 March 2017. I find that Ilechukwu was experiencing the Criterion B4 symptom of “intense and prolonged psychological distress” when he was remanded in Cantonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">D2: Persistent and negative beliefs about others</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Next, in relation to Criterion D2, the Prosecution stated that Dr Sarkar’s comments on Ilechukwu’s alleged paranoia should be regarded as distinct from, and should not be conflated with PTSS. This was because any alleged paranoia suffered by Ilechukwu stemmed from Ilechukwu’s supposed abnormal personality (on Dr Sarkar’s evidence) and in any event was not the subject of the inquiry in the Remitted Hearing.

Now, we know from his Wukari incident that he has persistently blamed the Hausas and Muslims and kept his distance from them apart from when he has to do business with them.

</div> The Prosecution also stated that there was no reason for Ilechukwu to be fearful of his life unless he was guilty of the charge faced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Here, I was only concerned with whether Ilechukwu was suffering from Criterion D4 during the period of remand <span class="font-italic">after </span>the charge had been served on him. I do not think the lies which Ilechukwu allegedly told Dr Sarkar in relation to the service of the charge particularly relevant. I also could not take into account the possibility of Ilechukwu’s guilt as furnishing an alternative explanation for his fearful reactions as this would involve exceeding the Terms of Reference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As in the case of Criterion B4, I am again of the view that the words Ilechukwu used to describe his period of remand in Cantonment during the trial of CC 32 of 2014 to be extreme and forceful. They display a degree of negativity which was unusual and persistent. I do not think it likely that Ilechukwu was lying or exaggerating his emotional state during his stint in Cantonment. There was no reason for him to have done so at the time. Ilechukwu’s testimony on his emotional state in Cantonment is also broadly consistent with the observations recorded in the First Sarkar Report. I also disagree with the Prosecution’s submission that there was no reason for Ilechukwu to be fearful unless he was guilty. Being incarcerated in a foreign land, all alone and not knowing what was going to happen is more than sufficient reason for anyone to be fearful even if one were not guilty of any crime. I therefore find that Ilechukwu suffered from the Criterion D4 symptom of a “persistent negative emotional state” when he was remanded in Cantonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effects of PTSS on Ilechukwu </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">179 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that PTSD/PTSS does not directly cause lying.

Secondly, I disagree that it was not the position of any of the expert witnesses’ that these PTSS had such a connection with the lies to the CNB. Dr Sarkar was the expert who provided the connection between the PTSS suffered and Ilechukwu adopting an “overly defensive course”. Thirdly, I disagree with the Prosecution’s characterisation of the issue of Ilechukwu’s lies having already been rejected by the Court of Appeal. The point of the present proceedings is to hear new evidence and decide whether Ilechukwu’s PTSS could furnish an explanation – one backed by expert evidence – as to why he told lies. Lastly, I disagree with the Prosecution’s submission that it is simply “fear and stress” which caused Ilechukwu to choose to lie in order to save himself. The Defence’s case is based on <span class="font-italic">recognisable </span>psychiatric symptoms, as contained in the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria, which caused Ilechukwu’s mind to act in certain ways, which in turn caused him to lie. From the perspective of a layman, it is understandable why one could characterise some of the PTSS symptoms, for <span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">g,</span> “intense psychological distress” and “persistent negative emotional state”, as akin to ordinary human reactions of “fear and stress”. However, I am of the view that the experts would have been capable of distinguishing ordinary human reactions of “fear and stress” from a diagnosis of specific PTSS. This is what the experts in these proceedings are tasked to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Having dealt with the Prosecution’s objections, I now detail my findings on the specific effects which the various PTSS had on Ilechukwu during the three relevant periods of time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">During the recording of the Pocketbook Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I have already accepted that Ilechukwu was suffering from “intense psychological distress” during the recording of the Pocketbook Statement (see above at [148]).

I note that Dr Sarkar did not say that this was a recognised psychiatric condition and the evidence he gave at [190] above was an opinion based on his clinical experience dealing with trauma patients. In view of this, I am unable to make a finding that this was what had happened in Ilechukwu’s case. However, it was clear from the evidence that Ilechukwu was an individual deeply affected by the traumatic memories of the Wukari massacre. While a normal person might not have lied under such circumstances, it is not inconceivable that a person with a traumatic past would have done so if he believed that lying would get him out of the traumatic predicament that he was in, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that lying would be a means to “protect” oneself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">During the recording of the Long Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I have made findings that Ilechukwu suffered from “intense psychological distress”, “persistent and negative belief about others” and a “persistent negative emotional state” during the recording of the Long Statements (see above at [163] – [178]). The issue is whether these specified PTSS caused him to develop “persistent paranoia” of the Investigating Officer which in turn caused him to consciously maintain his previous lies. The following excerpts from Dr Sarkar’s testimony reveal in greater detail the nature of the  “persistent paranoia” that Ilechukwu had towards the Investigating Officer:

This is in his 2014 testimony.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And some of the reasons that he gives almost borders, as I said earlier, not so much psychosis but certainly paranoid…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The suspicion that he had towards the IO in particular borders on sort of paranoia a bit more than normal suspicion that he would have.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 From the above excerpt, Dr Sarkar appeared to be establishing the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Investigating Officer was “playing him” and “setting him up in a kind of conspiratorial game” where he was “amassing evidence to justify the killing”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Investigating Officer did not explain how the Black Luggage and the drugs were linked.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Some of the reasons provided by Ilechukwu on why he failed to be honest with the Investigating Officer borders on paranoia.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The suspicion that Ilechukwu had towards the Investigating Officer was more than normal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 In my view, the above effects are justifiably linked to the criterion of a “persistent and negative belief about others”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 The Defence failed to detail how the remaining symptoms of “intense psychological distress” and a “persistent negative emotional state” suffered during the recording of the Long Statements caused Ilechukwu to develop a “persistent paranoia”.

Dr Sarkar stated in his report that the presence of PTSD was “likely to have led to an overestimation of [the] threat to his life” which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in order to save his life.

</div>
</div> Although Dr Sarkar did not say in his report that the presence of PTSS (as opposed to PTSD) would result in a similar effect, it was clear that Dr Sarkar held this view in light of his testimony at trial. As for Dr Ung, he stated that the two relevant effects that PTSD had on Ilechukwu were in relation to (a) effects on his thinking and decision making and (b) hyper-arousal and avoidance behaviour.

</div> At the same time, Dr Ung also concurred with Dr Sarkar’s view that the PTSD  was “likely to have led to an overestimation of [the] threat to his life”. Dr Winslow too expressed agreement with this aspect of Dr Sarkar’s opinion, and also that “the defendant was suffering from acute symptoms of PTSD with dissociation around the time that he made the inconsistent and unreliable statements (between 24 November and 21 November 2011). This could be a factor relevant in providing an unreliable account.” Dr Cheok, like the Defence experts, simply stated that there was no direct link between PTSD and lying.

</div>
</div> As the Defence relied primarily on Dr Sarkar’s view that Ilechukwu overestimated the threat to his life as a result of the symptoms, I confine my analysis solely to this aspect of his opinion. As I have already stated above at [188], I find that the Defence failed to spell out with sufficient clarity how the symptom of “intense psychological distress” caused Ilechukwu to overestimate the threat to his life during the recording of the Pocketbook Statement. For purposes of clarity, I also state that I find that the Defence had not shown how any of the <span class="font-italic">other</span> PTSS caused Ilechukwu to overestimate the threat to his life on a balance of probabilities in relation to the Cautioned Statement and Long Statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The foregoing paragraphs in this conclusion section are sufficient to address the Terms of Reference for this trial.  However, there is one point that I would like to express which is beyond those terms. At [88] of the Grounds of Decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated that “[w]hat tipped the scales are the numerous lies and omissions made by [Ilechukwu] in his statements, for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">which there is no innocent explanation</span>” (emphasis added).  Although the Court of Appeal in CA/CM 22/2018 had not expressed it as such, it seems to me that the true question is whether, in view of the evidence at this trial and the findings that may be made from such evidence, such an innocent explanation is possible. As the answer is not within the Terms of Reference of the Remitted Hearing, I must be content merely to pose the question.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kristy Tan, Tan Wee Hao, Zhou Yihong and Uni Khng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Public Prosecutor<span class="font-italic">;</span><div class="font-italic"><br/></div><div class="font-italic"><br/></div>Eugene Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya, Johannes Hadi (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP)  and Jerrie Tan (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the second accused<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
