</div> The facts of this case were said to be less serious than those of <span class="font-italic">Adri, </span>meriting downward calibration of the sentence there imposed. The cases of <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Pham Duyen Quyen </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1289 (“<span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span>”)<span class="font-italic">, P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Tan Swim Hong and others </span>[2019] SGHC 246 (<span class="font-italic">“Tan Swim Hong</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Abdul Qayyum Bin Abdul Malik </span>[2021] SGDC 89<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Abdul</span>”) were also relied upon and I discuss these cases below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I start my analysis with <span class="font-italic">Adri</span>, because of the reliance placed by both sides on this case. Adri had pleaded guilty to importing not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine into Singapore. Recruited by a drug syndicate to assist in the transportation of drugs between Guangzhou and Jakarta, Adri had ingested, inserted into his anus or hidden in his clothing 43 pellets of methamphetamine. He flew from Guangzhou to Singapore, intending to take a connecting flight to Jakarta, but he missed his connecting flight. At Changi Airport, he confessed to a customer service officer while in the transit area of the airport that he was in possession of drugs and was thereafter arrested. The Court of Appeal upheld his sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. It considered as aggravating (at [82]) that the accused took active and sophisticated steps to avoid detection of the offence. The Defence emphasised the absence of this aggravating factor in their argument for a downward calibration for this accused. At the same time, the Court of Appeal regarded as mitigating (at [83]) that Adri had voluntarily confessed to his crime, co-operated with authorities and pleaded guilty at an early stage. The Prosecution relied on the absence of the same mitigating factors in the present case to press for an upward calibration for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The exercise of comparing a case with a precedent must be a contextual one; a matter of weighing the various factors, rather than adding and subtracting in a mathematical exercise. In context, the specific aggravating factor found in <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> did not have as much significance as the particular mitigating factors in the same case. In general, an offender who takes active and sophisticated steps has made more effort and put more intention into his actions. Hence the Court of Appeal’s characterisation of the sophisticated scheme used in <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> as an aggravating factor. Here, the means of concealment was simpler than that used in <span class="font-italic">Adri</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> There was, I would agree, the absence of the particular aggravating factor. Nevertheless, a courier, because of his limited role within a necessarily larger enterprise, typically does not have full control in respect of the plan for the transport of the drugs. Thus, while the accused was able to exercise limited control over the means by which the Drugs were packaged, having requested through Syafie for the Drugs be broken into two (see [3]), he remained under Syafie’s direction. In contrast, in considering the particular mitigating factors found in <span class="font-italic">Ad</span><span class="font-italic">ri</span>, whether and to what extent any accused person chooses to co-operate with investigations is a matter entirely within his control. Further, public resources are saved wherever remorse on the part of the accused results in an early admission of guilt; and Adri’s confession was extremely timely. For this reason, the importance of the mitigating factors outstripped the importance of the aggravating factor in comparing the context at hand with <span class="font-italic">Adri</span>. The three operative factors highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> at [83] were very strongly mitigating: (a) Adri voluntarily confessed to his crime, a factor that Sundaresh Menon CJ characterised as “highly significant”; (b) Adri co-operated with the authorities from the outset; and (c) Adri pleaded guilty at an early stage. His early expression of contrition would have had a tangible and practical effect on public resources that would otherwise have been expended on investigation and trial. In contrast, the accused in the present case first attempted an excuse that his seat compartment could not be opened. Next, when questioned about the two bundles thereafter found when the compartment was opened, he chose to remain silent. He did not admit to the offence in any of his statements. His plea of guilt came after his case was readied for trial. It would not be a fair result for the present accused to be given a lighter sentence than Adri. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In this context, I deal with <span class="font-italic">Murugesan</span> and <span class="font-italic">Vashan</span>, with which, in my judgment, the present case had substantial commonality. In particular, <span class="font-italic">Murugesan</span> concerned an accused person in fairly similar circumstances. Murugesan pleaded guilty to trafficking not less than 14.99g of diamorphine, which placed the indicative starting point at the same point of the matrix as this offence. Using his motorcycle to transport two packets containing diamorphine, he parked at a HDB carpark where two others, Ansari and Bella, arrived in a car driven by a fourth person. Murugesan delivered the two packets of diamorphine to Ansari at the void deck of an adjoining block of HDB flats. All four were arrested shortly after. The High Court highlighted that the accused was a mere courier and exhibited genuine remorse in pleading guilty. The Court of Appeal, dismissing Murugesan’s appeal, observed that the sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes was consistent with authorities such as <span class="font-italic">Vashan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Hari Krishnan Selvan</span> [2017] SGHC 168 (“<span class="font-italic">Selvan</span>”): at [9]–[10]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 <span class="font-italic">Vashan</span>, too,<span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned a one-off transaction. Vashan, a 25-year old male, pleaded guilty to importing not less than 14.99g of diamorphine, which placed the indicative starting point at 26–29 years’ imprisonment pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework. He received two packets containing diamorphine from a Malaysian acquaintance. His instructions were to keep the packets in his underwear as he entered Singapore and thereafter to deliver them to a third person at a traffic light after he cleared the Tuas Checkpoint. He was promised RM1,000 in return. He was a first-time offender, had pleaded guilty and there was substantial co-operation with the CNB. The court imposed a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane: at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In submitting on a 26-year term, the Prosecution contended that this accused’s plea was late in the day, The fact remains that his plea has obviated the public expense of trial. Insofar as his change of heart came after Syafie’s plea of guilt, the charge the accused faced, too, was more serious than Syafie’s. In <span class="font-italic">Selvan</span>, where the High Court imposed 26 years’ imprisonment, two aggravating figures were highlighted (at [19], referring to [11]): Selvan had recruited two others to assist in his act of trafficking; and there was an element of concealment. In the present case, the act of concealment was more rudimentary. While Selvan placed, within his lorry, baskets of vegetables atop the baskets containing cabbages with diamorphine hidden within them, in the present case, the accused had merely placed the two bags of methamphetamine under bags of work tools. More importantly, the accused had not recruited others to assist in the plan, but was himself recruited to function as a courier. For this reason, I did not find the Prosecution’s suggestion of 26 years’ imprisonment persuasive. Returning to <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> in this context, while there was logic in the Prosecution’s submission that the present case merited a harsher sentence than <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> because of the absence of the operative factors highlighted at [21], it seemed to me fairer to consider <span class="font-italic">Adri</span> together with <span class="font-italic">Murugesan, </span><span class="font-italic">Vashan and Selvan</span> in context, viewing the precedents as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other cases cited by the Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I deal here with three other cases cited by the Defence.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Pham</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC), </span>the High Court sentenced the accused to 24 years’ imprisonment despite his having claimed trial. Defence counsel omitted to mention, and the Prosecution helpfully brought to my attention, that the Court of Appeal subsequently delivered grounds of decision in a later appeal: <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 571 (“<span class="font-italic">Pham (CA)</span>”). There, Tay Yong Kwang JA observed that the decision in the lower court was given prior to <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and using the <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span> benchmark, the appropriate sentence would have fallen within the top range of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment (at [55]). Further, using the methodology adopted by Chao Hick Tin JA prior to <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span>, in<span class="font-italic"> </span>the case of<span class="font-italic"> Loo Pei X</span><span class="font-italic">iang Alan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 5 SLR 500 at [14]–[18] also yielded a sentence at the top end of the sentencing range: at [57]. The Court of Appeal therefore held that there was no basis to reduce the sentence, and in fact, the sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment imposed by the lower court was “was lower than it would have been had the equivalent sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span> been applied”: at [58]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Swim Hong</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> one of the accused in the joint trial was sentenced by the High Court to 24 years’ imprisonment despite having claimed trial. Defence counsel omitted to mention that this sentence was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Reduan bin Mustaffar v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter</span> [2021] SGCA 64. Again, the Court of Appeal noted that “the sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment can, in fact, be said to be relatively lenient” (at [68]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Lastly, in <span class="font-italic">Abdul</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> an accused was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment in a more serious situation involving a syndicate. This case was not relevant as the sentence there was imposed in the context of multiple offences where the totality principle was in play. The district judge stated that a sentence of 26 years was suitable but adjusted this downwards to 25 years in the light of the sentences to be made consecutive (at [39] and [43]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Specific factual context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Coming to the specific context of this case, the starting point for analysis was the highest end of the sentencing band of 26–29 years' imprisonment as the charge was framed for the importation of not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine. Regarding the factors relevant at the second step, the accused performed a limited function under the direction of Syafie. He was not an orchestrating hand in the illicit activities: see <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span> at [51]. There were no aggravating factors and the accused had no antecedents. In light of the accused’s plea of guilt, his limited role as a courier and some co-operation with authorities in investigations, a discount from this starting point was appropriate. The accused was 30 years of age at the time and a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment would not be crushing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Pertinent to this is the sentence imposed on Syafie, who had offered the accused the task. In a query posed directly by the accused at his sentencing, he asked for a sentence lower than Syafie’s. It was not disputed that the accused had a smaller role in the overall transaction than Syafie. However, as mentioned at [10], Syafie had been charged with abetting the accused to import a lower amount of methamphetamine under s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA. The applicable range for the amount of methamphetamine Syafie was charged with was 20–22 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Syafie received 22 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, which is the highest end in the sentencing band applicable. As I explained to the accused, Syafie’s lower sentence resulted from his charge specifying the importation of a smaller amount of methamphetamine. In drug importation cases, the gravity of the offence is measured by the quantity of drugs involved: see <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span> at [21], [29] and [32]. The fact that both these charges were reduced from capital charges is not relevant; the relevant fact is the amount specified in the particular amended charge: see <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span> at [36]. Differentiating between offenders in this manner is a legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion: see <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span><span class="font-italic">Ravinthran v Attorney-General </span>[2012] 2 SLR 49 at [65]. Syafie’s lower sentence was a function of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Bee Ngan Karen v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1120, while discussing the parity principle, Chao JA highlighted at [41] that the principle should not be used to correct sentences which are disproportionate as a result of charging decisions made by the Prosecution. Chao JA explained, in this context at [38] and [45], the comment made by Yong Pung How CJ in <span class="font-italic">Phua Song Hua v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2004] SGHC 33 at [38] when comparing an accused who claimed trial with co-offenders who had pleaded guilty to less serious charges. In declining to apply the parity principle, Yong CJ concluded that there was “no longer any common basis for comparison”. The same principle applies in the present case. Syafie’s less serious charge reflects the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and it would not have been appropriate for the accused to be sentenced to a term lower than Syafie’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The relative roles played by the two men did have impact, nevertheless, on their individual sentences. As a result of his larger role, Syafie was sentenced to a term of imprisonment at the top of his applicable range. For the present accused, his smaller role was one of the reasons that I reduced the term of imprisonment to a term that was below the sentencing range applicable to him. The two sentences sit well one with the other. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For these reasons I sentenced the accused to 15 strokes of the cane and 25 years’ imprisonment, backdated to 31 March 2018. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean   </div><div class="txt-body text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mark Jayaratnam, Lim Shin Hui and Pavithra Ramkumar (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/> Gino Hardial Singh and Joel Wang (Abbots Chambers LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
