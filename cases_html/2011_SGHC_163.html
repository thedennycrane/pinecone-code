<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case (Originating Summons No 759 of 2010
                    (“OS 759”)) is one of two cross-appeals on several questions of
                    law which arise out of an arbitral award. The other is Originating Summons No
                    769 of 2010 (“OS 769”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The factual background is set out in detail in
                    my judgment in OS 769. For present purposes, it is enough to say that LW
                    Infrastructure Pte Ltd (“LW”) was the main contractor and Lim Chin
                    San Contractors Pte Ltd (“LCS”) was the sub-contractor in respect
                    of a building project involving the design and construction of an industrial
                    building at 31 Toh Guan Road East, Singapore (“the Project”). The
                    developer of the Project and LW’s employer under the main construction
                    contract was Topmost Industries Pte Ltd (“the
                Employer”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       LCS was appointed pursuant to a letter of award
                    issued by LW on 14 May 2001. The formal sub-contract document was executed on 30
                    November 2001. LCS was required to complete the sub-contract works by 2 August
                    2002. The sub-contract provided that the works would be practically completed
                    upon receipt of a Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) from the
                    relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 12 May 2003, LW terminated the sub-contract
                    pursuant to cl 27.1.2 which allowed it to do so upon failure by the
                    sub-contractor to proceed regularly and diligently with the performance of its
                    obligations. New sub-contractors were engaged and the TOP was eventually granted
                    on 1 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 22 June 2004, LW served a notice of
                    arbitration on LCS. Mr Johnny Tan Cheng Hye (“the
                    Arbitrator”) accepted appointment as the arbitrator on 9 November 2007.
                    He issued his award on 29 June 2010 (“the Award”). Subsequently,
                    both parties brought appeals on questions of law arising out of the
                    Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Questions of law raised in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       OS 759 was filed by LW, the main contractor, in
                    an appeal on the following questions of law:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the contractual right of LW to claim for
                            liquidated damages against LCS under the provisions of the sub-contract
                            for delay to the completion of the works by LCS, which accrued prior to
                            termination of the sub-contract, had been extinguished or rendered
                            inapplicable following termination of the sub-contract (“the
                            first question of law”);</div>

                            for delay to the completion of the works by LCS, which accrued prior to
                            termination of the sub-contract, had been extinguished or rendered
                            inapplicable following completion of the works by others after
                            termination of the sub-contract (“the second question of
                            law”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether, in a claim for liquidated damages
                            incurred or suffered by LW prior to the termination of the sub-contract
                            for delay in completion by LCS, LW was required to prove the extent of
                            damages incurred or suffered and attributable to LCS’s breach of
                            contract arising out of their delay in completing the works (“the
                            third question of law”).</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During the Arbitration, LW put its claim for
                    damages for delay in the completion of the sub-contract works as being
                    recoverable on the basis of three alternative grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as liquidated damages from 31 October 2002 to 28
                            July 2003 at the rate of $5,000 per day;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as liquidated damages from 31 October 2002 to 12
                            May 2003 at the rate of $5,000 per day, and general damages between 13
                            May 2003 and 28 July 2003 calculated at the same rate; or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as general damages between 31 October 2002 and 28
                            July 2003 calculated at the rate of $5,000 per day.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       All three bases of claim were rejected by the
                    Arbitrator. The total amount claimed by LW on each of the three alternative
                    grounds was the same ($1,360,000) because the general damages were also
                    calculated at $5,000 per day. This was the rate of liquidated damages which was
                    imposed on LW by the Employer for delay in the main contract works. In relation
                    to the claim for general damages, the Arbitrator held that LW had failed to
                    prove the extent of its loss which was attributable to LCS because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the main contract works included both the
                            sub-contract works and M&amp;E works, and LW had failed to prove the
                            extent of the delay in the main contract works which was attributable to
                            the delay in the sub-contract works; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">part of the delay after termination of the
                            sub-contract was due to the conduct of LW itself, and LW had failed to
                            prove the extent of delay after termination which was due to LCS’s
                            delay.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In its appeal, LW chose to focus solely on the
                    period between 31 October 2002 and 12 May 2003, <em>ie</em>
                    the period between the date on which the sub-contract ought to have been
                    completed (as extended by an agreed extension of time) and the date on which the
                    sub-contract was terminated by LW. Essentially, LW’s position is that its
                    termination of the sub-contract on 12 May 2003 did not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> have the effect of preventing the making of any claims for
                    liquidated damages which are based on the period <em>before</em> termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Arbitrator’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The liquidated damages clause in the
                    sub-contract is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">24</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<u>Damages for
                                non-completion</u>
</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">24 .1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If the Contractor fails to complete the
                            construction of the Works by the Completion Date the Employer shall
                            issue a notice in writing to the Contractor to that
                        effect.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">24 .2 .1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">     Subject to the
                            issue of a notice under clause 24.1 the Contractor shall, as the
                            Employer may require in writing not later than the date when the Final
                            Account and Final Statement become conclusive..., pay or allow to the
                            Employer the whole or part of a sum calculated at the rate [of $5,000
                            per day] as liquidated and ascertained damages for the period between
                            the Completion Date and the date of Practical Completion and the
                            Employer may deduct the same from any monies due or to become due to the
                            Contractor under this Contract (including any balance stated as due to
                            the Contractor in the Final Account and Final Statement) or the Employer
                            may recover the same from the Contractor as a debt.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">2     If, under clause 25.3.3, the
                    Employer fixes a later Completion Date, the Employer shall pay or repay to the
                    Contractor any amounts recovered allowed or paid under clause 24.2.1 for the
                    period up to such later Completion Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Arbitrator began his analysis by asking
                    the question, “Does Clause 24.2.1 survive after the termination of the
                    Sub-Contract?” He agreed with LCS that all future obligations cease upon
                    termination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    I agree with [LCS]
                            that when a contract is terminated, all future obligations under the
                            contract cease with the termination. [LCS] relied on <em>Re Sanpete Builders</em>... where the learned judge quoted
                                <em>Keatings</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>on Building Contracts</em>
                                (4<sup>th</sup> Edn):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“If the contract is brought to an end by determination or
                            otherwise, then prima facie all future obligations cease and no claim
                            can be made for liquidated damages accruing after determination. But
                            there may be some special clause which has the effect of keeping the
                            provision for payment of liquidated damages alive although the work has
                            been taken out of the hands of the contractor.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86    The learned judge
                            then went on to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“In <em>British Glanzstoff</em>... the
                            House of Lords held that a clause on liquidated damages applied only
                            where the contractors had completed the contract and did not apply where
                            the control of the contract had passed out of their
                            hands.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Arbitrator then went on to decide that the
                    liquidated damages clause “does not apply and any claim for damages by
                    [LW] would be by way of general damages”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    A party to a contract cannot be made responsible
                            for not fulfilling obligations which he has been denied the opportunity
                            on account of the termination of the contract unless there are specific
                            provisions in the contract that expressly has the effect of keeping that
                            provision alive after the termination. In this Sub-Contract there is no
                            such provision. Further, <em>as decided by the House of
                                Lords, liquidated damages apply only where the contractor had
                                completed the contract and not when their employment had been
                                terminated and control of the contract passed out of their
                                hands</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    In the present case, [LCS] had not completed the
                            contract. The completion of the Sub-Contract was taken out of their
                            hands. Hence, Clause 24.2.1 does not apply and any claim for damages by
                            [LW] would be by way of general damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">LW’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     LW accepts that the Arbitrator correctly
                    decided that all future obligations under the sub-contract ceased upon
                    termination so that no claim for liquidated damages which accrue after
                    termination may be made. This concession was rightly made: Stephen Furst QC
                    &amp; Sir Vivian Ramsey, <em>Keating on Construction
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006,
                        8<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Keating</em>”) at para 9-028. Its disagreement with the
                    Arbitrator stems from his decision, based on <em>British
                        Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company, Limited v General Accident, Fire and Life
                        Assurance Corporation, Limited</em> [1913] AC 143 (“<em>British Glanzstoff</em>”), that a liquidated damages
                    clause only “applies” where the sub-contractor against which the
                    liquidated damages claim was brought had in fact completed the works. In other
                    words, he decided that because the liquidated damages clause did not
                    “apply” in such a situation, no <em>claim</em> for liquidated damages could be brought regardless of
                    whether it was brought in relation to the period before or after termination of
                    the sub-contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     LW submits that <em>British
                        Glanzstoff</em> does not support the Arbitrator’s decision. The
                    report of the judgment of the House of Lords is somewhat brief and merely states
                    the following (at 144):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The First Division of the Court of Session... held, upon the construction
                        of clauses 24 and 26 of the contract, that the clause as to liquidated
                        damages applied only where the contractors had themselves completed the
                        contract and did not apply where the control of the contract had passed out
                        of their hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The House affirmed the decision of the First Division of the Court of
                        Session upon the grounds stated by that Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Arbitrator was content to take these paragraphs at face value and
                    decided that, <em>as a matter of law</em>, <em>all</em> claims of liquidated damages cannot be sustained
                    where the contractor has not in fact completed the works. However, an
                    examination of the decision of the lower court, as reported at <em>The British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company, Limited v The General
                        Accident, Fire, and Life Assurance Corporation, Limited</em>
                    [1912] SC 591, does not support the Arbitrator’s decision
                    because, on the facts, it was a case where the termination of the contract
                    occurred before the date of completion (at 592-593):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... By article 23 of the said articles of agreement it was provided that
                        possession of the site should be given to the contractors on or before the
                        1st of May 1909, and that they should begin the works immediately thereafter
                            <em>and complete</em> the same <em>by the 31st day of January 1910</em>. Possession was duly given
                        to the contractors on said 1st day of May 1909. By article 24 thereof it was
                        provided that if the contractors failed to complete the works by 31st
                        January 1909, or within any extended period allowed by the architect
                        thereunder, the contractors should be bound to pay to the employer the sum
                        of £250 sterling per week for the first four weeks, and £500
                        sterling per week for all subsequent weeks during which the works remained
                        unfinished. ... The [contractors] entered upon the construction of the said
                        works and <em>carried them on until the 20th day of August
                            1909, when a receiving order was granted ... against them</em>. No
                        further work was done by the [contractors]. In consequence of the ...
                        failure to complete the contract it was necessary for the [employer] to
                        obtain the services of other contractors, and on <em>16th
                            September 1909</em> they entered into articles of agreement with
                        Messrs Joshua Henshaw &amp; Sons ... who duly completed the construction of
                        the said works. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the facts of <em>British
                        Glanzstoff</em> were such that the termination of the contract (on 16
                    September 1909) had occurred before the agreed date of completion (on 31 January
                    1910). Therefore, by definition, there could not have been any claim to
                    liquidated damages as of the date of termination because the completion date had
                    not yet arrived. This was explained by Lord MacKenzie in the lower court (at
                    600):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am unable to see how the [employer] can charge [the
                        contractors] under a liquidated damages clause, because they failed to
                        complete the works by 31st January 1910, when on [the contractors’]
                        bankruptcy the [employer] made a contract with Henshaw &amp; Sons to
                        complete by 31st December 1909.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The decision was but a different iteration of the well-established
                    principle that no liquidated damages accrue once a contract has been terminated,
                    in the absence of express contractual provision to the contrary. LW submits that
                    the House of Lords did not intend that termination or the fact that the control
                    of the contract had passed out of the hands of the contractor should constitute
                    a new defence to a claim of liquidated damages. I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     LW’s interpretation is supported by the
                    well-established principle that the termination of a contract does not affect
                    rights which have accrued before termination: <em>Bank of Boston
                        Connecticut v European Grain and Shipping Ltd</em> [1989] 1 AC 1056 at
                    1098H-1099D; <em>Hurst v Bryk and others</em> [2002]
                    1 AC 185 at 199D-E. This was explained in H G Beale QC (gen ed),
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts vol 1</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 2008, 30th Ed) (“<em>Chitty</em>”)
                    at paras 24-048 and 24-051 in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [I]n principle, only those primary obligations falling due after the
                        date of discharge will come to an end; <em>those which have
                            accrued due at the time may still be enforceable as such</em>.
                        Thus, while both parties are discharged from further performance of their
                        primary obligations under the contract, “<em>rights
                            are not divested or discharged which have been unconditionally
                            acquired</em>”. The party in breach can therefore enforce
                        against the innocent party such rights as it has “unconditionally
                        acquired” by the date of termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This principle was reiterated in Nicholas Dennys QC, Mark Raeside QC
                    &amp; Robert Clay, <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010,
                        12<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Hudson</em>”) at para 6-039:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the absence of special provision, it is submitted that any liquidated
                        damages accrued due prior to the date of rescission, forfeiture or
                        determination will be recoverable, but in respect of any later delay the
                        Employer will be required to prove their damage (if any) in the normal
                        way... Again, it has been seen that the Full Court of Victoria [in <em>SMK Cabinets</em>, see <em>infra</em> at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>],
                        consistently with this, has held that, in a case of prevention by the
                        ordering of extras where there is no applicable extension of time clause,
                            <em>liquidated damages already accrued due up to the date
                            of the order for the variations will be recoverable</em>, but only
                        general damages for delay thereafter. <em>This accords with
                            the general principle, following rescission of a contract at common law,
                            that previously accrued rights, including rights of payment up to that
                            time if such exist, will be enforced</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, there is no express provision which stipulates
                    that a right to liquidated damages for the period between the agreed (or
                    extended) completion date and termination will be extinguished upon
                    termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Arbitrator also relied on <em>Re Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 5
                        (“<em>Re Sanpete Builders</em>”). LW
                    submits that the case does not support the Arbitrator’s interpretation of
                    the law. I agree. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) was not concerned with the
                    validity of a claim for liquidated damages accruing <em>prior</em> to the termination of the contract. This is clear from the
                    following passage in the judgment (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>As on the date of termination of the sub-contract, no
                            liquidated damages have accrued to Sanpete because the date for
                            completion has yet to arrive</em>. There is nothing in the
                        sub-contract which preserves the right to liquidated damages after
                        termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     
          <em>Re Sanpete
                        Builders</em> was a case where the termination of the sub-contract by
                    the contractor occurred before the completion date (as extended by the
                    architect). The original completion date was 25 July 1986, but this was extended
                    by six months by the architect to 25 January 1987. The sub-contract was
                    terminated on 4 October 1986. Chao JC made it quite clear that he was only
                    dealing with the situation where termination occurred before the extended
                    completion date (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the fact that the subcontract was terminated by Sanpete on 4
                        October 1986, it seems clear to me that the liquidated damages clause can
                        have no application <em>as the clause talks about if the
                            contractor fails to complete the said works by the date. That is a
                            condition precedent which must be satisfied before liquidated damages
                            may be imposed</em>. A contractor has until the last hour of the
                        day fixed for completion in which to finish the works: see <em>Startup v MacDonald</em> (1843) 6 Man &amp; G 593
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, Chao JC rejected the claim of liquidated damages despite the
                    fact that it was estimated by the architect that, as of 8 July 1986 (<em>ie</em>, before the extended completion date), the works were
                    behind schedule by 163 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In summary, the cases cited by the Arbitrator,
                        <em>ie</em>, <em>British
                        Glanzstoff</em> and <em>Re Sanpete Builders</em>,
                    do not support his conclusion. It is well-established that the effect of
                    termination on liquidated damages is only that no claim to liquidated damages
                    can be brought in respect of the period after termination. In the absence of
                    express provision to the contrary, termination of the contract does not affect a
                    claim to liquidated damages in respect of the period before
                termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether cl 24 survived termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     LCS argues that cl 24 (the liquidated damages
                    clause) did not survive the termination of the sub-contract, relying on
                        <em>British Glanzstoff</em> and <em>Re
                        Sanpete Builders</em>, and that therefore no <em>claim</em> to liquidated damages for the period <em>before</em> termination could be brought. It is not disputed that cl
                    24 did not survive termination in the absence of express provision to the
                    contrary; rather, what is disputed is whether or not this should necessarily
                    mean that liquidated damages for the period before that cannot be <em>claimed</em>. For the reasons outlined in the previous
                    section, the two cases do not assist LCS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     LCS also relies on <em>Engineering Construction Pte Ltd v Attorney-General</em> [1994] 1
                    SLR(R) 125 (“<em>Engineering
                    Construction</em>”). LCS initially argued that Lim Teong Qwee JC
                    held (at [31]) that the employer was not
                    entitled to deduct or recover liquidated damages in respect of any period during
                    which the contractor was in delay before termination. However, this in itself
                    does not assist LCS because, as LW points out, the <em>ratio</em> of the case was that the condition precedent to the right
                    to liquidated damages had not been fulfilled. In its further submissions, LCS
                    accepts that the facts in <em>Engineering Construction</em>
                    were different but relies instead on observations made by the judge (at
                        [30]). Because these observations
                    relate to the issue of the point in time at which the right to liquidated
                    damages accrues under the contract, I will leave this point aside for the time
                    being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether time had been set at large</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     LCS argues that the Arbitrator was correct to
                    hold that LW was not entitled to liquidated damages for the period between the
                    agreed completion date (as extended) and the date of termination, because time
                    had been set at large by reason of acts of prevention on LW’s part
                    (although this was not the justification which was articulated by the
                    Arbitrator). As I have dismissed LCS’s argument in OS 769 that time was
                    set at large, it is unnecessary to deal with this argument any
                further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the avoidance of doubt, even if I was
                    wrong to have held that time had not been set at large, a claim of liquidated
                    damages would still be available to LW to the extent that it was made in
                    relation to the period before the acts of prevention had been committed: see
                        <em>SMK Cabinets v Hili Modern Electrics Pty Ltd</em>
                    [1984] VR 391 (“<em>SMK
                    Cabinets</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether LW’s right to liquidated damages had accrued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I have held that liquidated damages which have
                    accrued before termination of a contract may still be claimed or deducted after
                    termination. The question which then arises is whether or not LW’s right
                    to liquidated damages had accrued as of the date of termination on 12 May 2003.
                    This is the crux of this appeal. LCS argues that LW’s right to claim
                    liquidated damages <em>had not yet accrued</em> and
                    therefore did not survive the termination. It advances several grounds for this
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Validity of notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     First, LCS argues that LW had failed to
                    provide a valid notice pursuant to cl 24, the relevant portion of which is
                    as follows:</p>

                                effect</em>.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     LW argues that it had in fact provided a valid

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We reserve our rights to take any action deemed necessary by us for the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     LCS argues that this letter did not constitute
                    a valid notice because it did not <em>specifically</em>
                    refer to LW’s right to liquidated damages. In my opinion, such a reference
                    is not a requirement of cl 24.1 which <em>prima facie</em>
                    merely requires that the notice should state that the sub-contractor failed to
                    complete the works by the completion date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In any event, this argument does not
                    constitute an argument of law. While it is true that s 49(1) of the Arbitration
                    Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) merely specifies that
                        <em>appeals</em> must be brought on questions of law
                    arising out of arbitral awards, by necessary implication the arguments raised in
                    opposition to such appeals must <em>also</em> be arguments
                    of law, although they need not themselves necessarily arise out of the award due
                    to the operation of O 69 r 6(6):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the respondent contends that the relevant part or parts of the award
                        should be upheld on grounds not or not fully expressed in the award, such
                        grounds should be included in the Respondent’s Case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">LCS’s argument that there was no valid notice pursuant to cl 24
                    contains two distinct elements: (a) that there was an erroneous <em>interpretation</em> of the notice requirement in cl 24;
                    and/or (b) that there was an erroneous <em>application</em>
                    of this requirement to the letter. The first element is indeed a question of
                    law, but it is one which does not “arise out of” the Award for the
                    simple reason that the Arbitrator decided that LW’s claim of liquidated
                    damages failed at the preliminary stage because cl 24 did not
                    “apply” where the sub-contract had been terminated; he did not go
                    on to consider whether all the prerequisites to the right to liquidated damages
                    had been satisfied. The second element is a pure question of fact which is not
                    open to appeal under s 49.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Interpretation of cl 24</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Secondly, LCS argues that cl 24 provides that
                    the <em>right</em> to liquidated damages <em>only arises</em> upon <em>actual</em> completion
                    of the works. LCS notes that cl 24.2.2 provides that in the event that LW grants
                    an extension of time under cl 25 and fixes a later completion date, LW is not
                    entitled to claim liquidated damages for the extended period. This is certainly
                    correct, but it does not even begin to answer the broader question of whether
                    liquidated damages can be claimed for the period <em>beyond</em> the extended completion date up to the time of
                    termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Additionally, LCS notes that cl 24.2.1
                    specifies that liquidated damages are calculated “for the period between
                    the Completion Date and the date of Practical Completion”. The Arbitrator
                    held that the completion date was extended to 4 November 2002. It is not
                    disputed that practical completion eventually occurred when the TOP was obtained
                    on 1 August 2003. LCS notes that in <em>Re Sanpete
                        Builders</em>, Chao JC stated (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>As on the date of termination of the sub-contract, no
                            liquidated damages have accrued to Sanpete because the date for
                            completion has yet to arrive</em>. There is nothing in the
                        sub-contract which preserves the right to liquidated damages after
                        termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">LCS submits that, similarly, at the time of termination on 12 May
                    2003, the date of practical completion had yet to arrive because the TOP had not
                    been obtained, and that therefore no right to liquidated damages had accrued. It
                    is undoubtedly true that the date of practical completion had not yet arrived,
                    but this does not assist LCS in any way. Its reliance on <em>Re
                        Sanpete Builders</em> is misplaced because Chao JC was but reiterating
                    the well-established principle that the right to liquidated damages only arises
                    once the date of completion has passed. The date of completion referred to by
                    Chao JC in that paragraph was the date of <em>agreed</em>
                    completion (and not the date on which the works were actually
                completed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     More pertinently, LCS’s argument should
                    be rejected because it conflates, on the one hand, the conditions for the
                    existence of a right to liquidated damages, and, on the other hand, the total
                    quantum of damages which may be recovered pursuant to that contractual right. As
                    LW points out, if it was the parties’ intention that the right to
                    liquidated damages would only accrue once the actual date of practical
                    completion had passed, they could have easily provided for this in the clause.
                    However, cl 24 does not in terms provide for any condition precedent apart from
                    the requirement to issue a notice. It is not inconceivable that the parties
                    would have intended that liquidated damages could be claimed or deducted in
                    respect of a shorter period if practical completion was not yet achieved when
                    the sub-contract was terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This interpretation of cl 24 is supported by
                    the fact that it is well-established that the function of a liquidated damages
                    clause is to allow the employer to claim or deduct liquidated damages
                    immediately the agreed completion date has been overrun. This was explained in
                        <em>Hudson</em> (at para 6-029):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he most important practical function of liquidated damages clauses
                        is to confer a power to deduct the damages <em>immediately</em> from monies due to the Contractor <em>on interim certificate once the completion date or extended
                            date has passed</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Hudson</em> goes on to explain the importance
                    of this principle (at para 6-040):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [A]s in many forms of contract liquidated damages <em>become due immediately on the date when completion should have
                            occurred, and provision is made for a right of immediate deduction of
                            liquidated damages from monies due after that date</em> (for
                        example, on interim certificate); financial rights or obligations may well
                        have accrued by the time of determination or rescission, and it would, to
                        say the least, be highly inconvenient to reopen the whole state of accounts
                        between the parties, as would be the case if the liquidated damages
                        provision was held to have been invalidated retrospectively upon
                        forfeiture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Uncertainty as to date of contractual completion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     LCS’s most promising argument is based
                    on the inherent uncertainty as to the exact completion date according to which
                    the <em>total</em> amount of liquidated damages will
                        <em>eventually</em> be calculated. This argument is
                    advanced primarily on the basis of certain <em>obiter</em>
                    observations in <em>Engineering Construction</em>. The
                    facts of the case were as follows. The plaintiff agreed to complete certain
                    construction works for the government by 18 December 1991. Cl 31(a) provided
                    that the government would be entitled to liquidated damages for any delay in
                    completion, and cl 32(a) provided for the certifying engineer to have the power
                    to grant and certify extensions of time. On 30 April 1992 (<em>ie</em>, after the agreed completion date), the government wrongfully
                    terminated the agreement. The plaintiff accepted this termination as a
                    repudiatory breach. At that time, the works were not yet completed.
                    Subsequently, on 29 September 1992, the certifying engineer issued a certificate
                    stating that the works ought reasonably to have been completed by 28 December
                    1991 and another certificate stating the amount of liquidated damages which was
                    due to the government. The plaintiff successfully sought a declaration that the
                    government was not entitled to the liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The <em>ratio</em> of the
                    decision was that the certifying engineer lost the power to issue the
                    certificates (which were a condition precedent to the right to liquidated
                    damages) once the contract was terminated. Lim JC nonetheless went on to express
                    his views on the other issues that were argued before him, citing the decision
                    of the lower court in <em>British Glanzstoff</em> with
                    approval. The observations relied upon by LCS (at para [30] of the judgment) can be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">So long as the contract remains in force, events
                            for which an extension of time may be granted may occur. Therefore, the
                            total length of extensions of time cannot be determined until the works
                            are actually completed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Under cl 31 of the contract, liquidated damages
                            are payable in respect of the period the works remain uncompleted. This
                            period cannot be finally determined until the works are in fact
                            completed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">This period also cannot be determined if the
                            works can no longer be completed by the contractor by reason of the
                            contract having come to an end (citing <em>British
                                Glanzstoff</em>);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If there is already delay to completion when the
                            contract is terminated, that period of delay may in fact be shorter upon
                            completion (if the contract had not been terminated) than at the time of
                            termination. Say the date for completion is 30 June. The works are not
                            completed and will require another 15 days. The contractor proceeds with
                            the works, and on 5 July extras are ordered by the employer and the
                            engineer allows an extension of 25 days (<em>ie</em>, to 25 July). The contractor completes the original
                            works as well as the extras on 30 July. What was potentially a 15-day
                            period of delay has been reduced to one of only 5 days;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The first extension of time certificate issued by
                            the engineer cannot be final until the works are actually completed, and
                            since further performance has been taken out of the contractor’s
                            hands altogether, the extension of time clause can no longer
                            operate.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     LCS relies on these observations to establish
                    that liquidated damages can only be calculated and imposed after the works are
                    completed by the original contractor and after the project consultants take into
                    account all events that happened prior to the completion of the works. This is
                    because the completion date in a construction contract is liable to change and
                    there may be events which occur after termination which in fact reduce the
                        <em>effective</em> delay <em>before</em> termination <em>for which a contractor is
                        liable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my view, however, the observations in
                        <em>Engineering Construction</em> do not provide any
                    assistance to LCS. Statements (a), (b), (d) and (e) are undoubtedly true but do
                    not address the issue of whether a right to liquidated damages has already
                    arisen. As noted above, the right to liquidated damages on LW’s part arose
                    as soon as actual completion of the works was not achieved by the agreed
                    completion date. What is uncertain is merely the total amount of liquidated
                    damages to which LW is entitled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The observation in (d) that, <em>ex post facto</em>, the total period of delay may turn out to
                    be shorter than the expected period of delay viewed at the agreed completion
                    date, is indeed correct. But this does not assist LCS because the right to
                    liquidated damages may be characterised in the following manner: a right to
                    liquidated damages arises the moment the works have not been completed by the
                    agreed completion date, and the total quantum of a claim to liquidated damages
                    consequent on this right will increase with every day (or week, <em>etc</em>, as the case may be) that actual completion is not
                    achieved. However, the total quantum of liquidated damages that may be claimed
                    is subject to alteration by subsequent events such as extensions of time which
                    will, by extending the agreed completion date, reduce the effective period of
                    delay for which the contractor is liable. In other words, the <em>maximum</em> quantum of liquidated damages that can be claimed
                    increases as time passes, but the actual quantum of liquidated damages which are
                    eventually claimed or deducted, over the entire period, may be less than
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This characterisation is supported by the
                    terms of the sub-contract. LW points out that the sub-contract stipulates that
                    the parties should deal with issues of extension of time <em>as
                        and when</em> the relevant events occur: there is no requirement to do
                    so only after practical completion is achieved, and in fact such an approach is
                    prohibited. Cl 25.2.1 requires LCS to give notice of an event which will or is
                    likely to cause delay to the progress of the works <em>once this
                        becomes reasonably apparent</em>. Cl 25.2.3 also requires notice to be
                    given <em>whenever there is a subsequent material
                        change</em> in the circumstances. In turn, cl 25.3 requires LW to
                    grant the necessary extension of time and fix a new completion date (where
                    applicable) within 12 weeks of LCS’s notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     LW also points out that the sub-contract
                    provisions stipulate that liquidated damages accrue <em>upon</em> the occurrence of a delay in the completion of the
                    sub-contract works. LW is entitled to deduct any liquidated damages from
                    payments <em>other than</em> the balance stated as due to
                    LCS in the final account and final statement – cl 24.2.1. Also, LW has to
                        <em>repay</em> to LCS any liquidated damages <em>previously</em> paid to LW <em>upon the fixing
                        of a later completion date</em> – cl 24.2.2. It is clear that
                    cll 24.2.1 and 24.2.2 directly contradict LCS’s submission that LW’s
                    right to liquidated damages cannot accrue before actual
                completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This characterisation is additionally
                    supported by two cases. In <em>JF Finnegan Ltd v Community
                        Housing Association Ltd</em> (1995) 77 BLR 22, the English Court of
                    Appeal dealt with the construction and interpretation of a liquidated damages
                    clause in a JCT contract which is <em>in pari materia</em>
                    with cl 24 of the sub-contract. Peter Gibson LJ held that liquidated damages
                    accrue once there is delay to the completion of the construction works,
                    regardless of the fact that the agreed completion date may be subsequently
                    revised. The relevant passage from the judgment is as follows (at 34H-I):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Until another completion date is fixed, the employer is entitled to claim

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>SMK Cabinets</em>,
                    it was held by the Full Supreme Court of Victoria that an employer may not claim
                    liquidated damages in respect of delay arising after it had ordered certain
                    variation works after the due date for completion had passed. However, the
                    employer’s right to claim liquidated damages in respect of delay occurring
                    before its order of variation remained intact. Brooking J explained the position
                    quite clearly:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first matter concerns the date of the prevention... The obligation is
                        to complete by a certain date... ; the subsequent ordering of extras cannot
                        have prevented the contractor’s performance of that obligation. Such
                        is the argument. But... <em>the consequences to the
                            contractor of [its] failure depend on the number of days during which
                            the failure continues: the provision is for graduated sums, the
                            obligation being to pay a larger sum for every day by which completion
                            is delayed. The promise is to pay alternative sums, depending on the
                            date by which the work is finished: $35 if it is not finished before 22
                            July, $70 if it is not finished before 23 July, $105 if it is not
                            finished before 24 July, and so on</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he ordering of variations after the due date which must
                        substantially delay completion will, unless the contract provides otherwise,
                        and in the absence of an applicable extension of time clause, disable the
                        proprietor from recovering or retaining liquidated damages which might
                        otherwise have accrued after the giving of the order, <em>the
                            employer’s right in respect of amounts that have already accrued
                            by way of liquidated damages not being affected</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     LCS submits that it would be perverse if, in
                    the situation where the sub-contract has been terminated, events after
                    termination which could decrease the total number of days by which completion is
                    delayed should be ignored. LW’s argument does not, however, lead to this
                    outcome: it acknowledges that events after termination may affect the quantum of
                    a claim for liquidated damages for the period before termination. Rather,
                    LW’s contention is that the possibility of post-termination events which
                    may result in extensions of time should not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> negate the existence of the right to recover liquidated
                    damages. For the reasons outlined above, this is correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The only statement in <em>Engineering Construction</em> which addresses the issue directly is
                    statement (c), which is made in reliance on <em>British
                        Glanzstoff</em>. I have dealt with this point above and found that
                        <em>British Glanzstoff</em> was decided in very
                    different circumstances. The correct interpretation of <em>Engineering Construction</em> is that Lim JC did not mean that
                    post-termination events should affect the <em>existence</em> of a right to liquidated damages: he merely observed,
                    correctly, that such events could affect the <em>quantum</em> of the <em>total</em> claim of
                    liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Standard industry practice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     LCS’s final argument relies on the
                    provisions contained in two standard forms widely used in Singapore, <em>ie</em>, the <em>Public Sector Standard
                        Conditions of Contract for Construction Works</em> (Building and
                    Construction Authority, 2008, 6th Ed) (“<em>PSSCOC</em>”) and the <em>Singapore Institute
                        of Architects Articles and Conditions of Building Contract: Lump Sum
                        Contract</em> (Singapore Institute of Architects, 2008, 8th Ed)
                        (“<em>SIA Contract</em>”), to support its
                    proposition that further delay arising between termination and actual completion
                    has to be taken into account before the <em>right</em> to
                    liquidated damages arises. It is doubtful whether the terms of other contracts,
                    even if they are contained in standard forms widely used in Singapore, are at
                    all relevant to the interpretation of cl 24 which is clear and not ambiguous.
                    Even if the terms of such standard forms were materially similar to cl 24 and cl
                    24 was ambiguous, the ultimate objective is to ascertain the parties’
                    objective intentions as expressed in the contract which they have entered into
                    and not some other contract. As the Court of Appeal stressed in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [132(d)], the
                    principle of objectively ascertaining the shared contractual intentions of the
                    parties remains paramount and that therefore any extrinsic evidence must go
                    towards proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately
                    agreed upon. In the present case, there was no evidence that the parties had
                    regard to the <em>PSSCOC</em> or <em>SIA
                        Contract</em> when entering into the sub-contract. Indeed, as will be
                    explained later, it is apparent that the chosen allocation of rights and
                    obligations in the sub-contract is significantly different from that in the
                        <em>PSSCOC</em> and <em>SIA
                        Contract</em>. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness LCS’s
                    arguments will be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     LCS argues that standard industry practice
                    dictates that the final statement and final account are issued only after
                    practical completion is achieved. Therefore, the parties must have intended that
                    LCS be given an opportunity to make representations to LW as to the state of
                    accounts between themselves before the final statement and final account is
                    issued. Although it is undoubtedly true that the final statement and final
                    account are, as a matter of practice, issued only after practical completion is
                    achieved, this is neither here nor there. It is also not uncommon that interim
                    statements and interim certificates are issued and that the amounts stated in
                    those documents are immediately payable upon their issue (subject only to
                    adjustment in subsequent statements and/or certificates). This was explained in
                    Chow Kok Fong, <em>Law and Practice of Construction
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2004,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed) (“<em>Chow Kok
                        Fong</em>”) (at p 338):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Interim certificates are certifications of payments made in accordance
                        with a timetable in the contract... These certifications are never intended
                        to be a precise determination of the value of the works... A more accurate
                        view of the amount certified in an interim certificate is to treat them as
                        estimates of the value of the work done up to the date shown in the
                        certificate. Thus, while the employer or owner is obliged to pay what is
                        certified, the amounts certified are not binding on the parties in the sense
                        that they are subject to adjustment on completion ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     This provisional quality of interim
                    certificates was also explained in <em>Keating</em> at para
                    5-009 and <em>Hudson</em> at para 4-074 to 4-075. Clause
                    24.2, which envisages that a right to liquidated damages may accrue before
                    practical completion and the issue of the final statement and final account,
                    encapsulates this industry practice.</p>

                    statement and final account, LCS relies on specific clauses contained in the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     LCS argues that clauses such as cl 31.3 of the
                        <em>PSSCOC</em> and cl 32(8)(g) of the <em>SIA Contract</em> were introduced because it was recognised
                    that liquidated damages are assessed for the period up to actual completion:
                    these clauses empowered the contract administrator (a) to assess events
                        <em>after</em> termination that could change the
                    overall situation and (b) to give the terminated contractor credit for events
                    that happen after termination. LCS points out that cl 25 (the extension of time
                    clause) also contemplates that the completion date is liable to further changes.
                    However, this argument does not assist LCS. In advancing this argument, LCS has
                    again conflated, on the one hand, the conditions for the existence of a right to
                    liquidated damages, and, on the other hand, the total quantum of liquidated
                    damages to which the contractor is entitled. The uncertainty as to the total
                    quantum of liquidated damages available to an employer or contractor does not
                    negate the existence of the right to liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In any event, LW notes that the liquidated
                    damages provisions in the <em>PSSCOC</em> and <em>SIA Contract</em> survive termination unlike cl 24 of the
                    sub-contract because there is express contractual provision to this effect: see,
                    respectively, cl 31.3(a) of the <em>PSSCOC</em> and cl
                    32(8)(g)(i) of the <em>SIA Contract</em>. Therefore, credit
                    was given to the original contractor for matters following termination which
                    would have entitled the original contractor to an extension of time had it
                    completed the works itself. The provision of such credit was not because of the
                    termination <em>per se</em>, but because of the continued
                    application of the liquidated damages provisions to the original contractor
                    after termination. By contrast, in the present case the sub-contract did not
                    provide for the same liquidated damages to be applied to the original
                    sub-contractor after termination. Thus, these clauses cannot possibly be
                    relevant to the interpretation of cl 24 given the significantly different
                    allocation of rights and obligations in the event of delay to the completion of
                    the works and subsequent termination of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I hold that the answer to the first question
                    of law is “No”. Thus, I allow LW’s appeal on the first
                    question of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I would note one last point before turning to
                    the appeal on the second question of law. Both parties argued their respective
                    cases before the Arbitrator and this court on the basis that the termination was
                    that <em>of the sub-contract</em>. The first issue referred
                    to the Arbitrator by LW was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether the <em>termination of the Sub-Contract</em>
                        by [LW] on 12 May 2003 was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And, on appeal, the first question of law posed was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether the contractual right of [LW] to claim for liquidated damages
                        against [LCS] under the provisions of the Sub-Contract for delay to the
                        completion of the Sub-Contract Works by [LCS], which accrued prior to
                            <em>termination of the Sub-Contract</em>, is
                        extinguished or rendered inapplicable following <em>termination of the Sub-Contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There is, however, a clear conceptual
                    distinction between termination <em>of the contract</em>
                    and termination <em>of one’s employment</em> under
                    the contract. This distinction was explained in <em>Chow Kok
                        Fong</em> (at p 598):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The activation of the termination proceedings usually operates to alter
                        the employer’s obligations for payments. These changes may occur at
                        two levels. Firstly, where the termination provision provides for the
                        contract to be terminated as opposed to the determination of the
                        contractor’s employment, it would seem that the effect is that
                            <em>all the arrangements under the contract comes to an
                            end</em>. In these circumstances, an architect or engineer becomes
                            <em>functus officio</em> and he can no longer
                        certify payments or administer the contract: <em>Engineering
                            Construction Pte Ltd v Attorney General (No. 2)</em> (1994). For
                        this reason, <em>the wording used in the provisions of
                            contracts like the JCT and the SIA standard forms distinguish carefully
                            between the determination of a contractor’s employment and the
                            termination of a contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This conceptual distinction was also explained in <em>Chitty vol 2</em> (at para 37-242):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[Determination] refers to termination of the employment
                            of the contractor under the contract, as opposed to bringing the
                            contract itself to an end</em>... Both parties remain bound by
                        terms of the contract which are to apply upon determination coming into
                        effect... <em>The consequences of determination for default
                            are broadly equivalent to the effect of acceptance of repudiatory breach
                            of contract as terminating the contract. In the case of determination,
                            however, the contract makes express provision for the
                            consequences</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the present case, the notice of termination
                    by LW on 12 May 2003 was, on closer examination, a notice of termination of
                    LCS’s employment under the sub-contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As you have failed to proceed regularly and diligently with the
                        performance of your contractual obligations, we hereby give you notice to
                        determine the contract under Clause 27 of the Conditions of Contract. We
                        therefore require you to leave site immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Cl 27 refers to a termination of employment and not a termination of
                    the sub-contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">27 .1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Without
                            prejudice to any other rights or remedies which the Employer may
                            possess, if the Contractor shall make default in any one or more of the
                            following respects, that is to say:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">if he fails to proceed regularly and diligently
                                with the performance of his obligations under this Contract;
                                ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then the Employer may give to him a notice... specifying the default. If
                        the Contractor either shall continue such default..., then the Employer may
                        within 10 days after such continuance or repetition... forthwith <em>determine the employment of the Contractor under this
                            Contract</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In truth, therefore, the mere termination of
                    LCS’s employment under the sub-contract on 12 May 2003 would not <em>ipso facto</em> have affected the existence of the liquidated
                    damages clause, although the claim of liquidated damages for the period
                        <em>after</em> termination of LCS’s employment
                    would still be barred, applying the reasoning in <em>British
                        Glanzstoff</em>, in the absence of express provision to the contrary.
                    Thus, the net result would have been the same. As the parties did not identify
                    and raise this issue before the Arbitrator, I have decided this appeal on the
                    basis that the termination on 12 May 2003 was that of the
                sub-contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     LW argues that the Arbitrator erred when he
                    decided that a claim for liquidated damages which had accrued before termination
                    would fail if the sub-contract had been terminated and control over the Project
                    had passed out of LCS’s hands. The relevant passage in the Award is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    A party to a contract cannot be made responsible
                            for not fulfilling obligations which he has been denied the opportunity
                            on account of the termination of the contract unless there are specific
                            provisions in the contract that expressly has the effect of keeping that
                            provision alive after the termination. In this Sub-Contract there is no
                            such provision. <em>Further, as decided by the House of
                                Lords</em> [in <em>British
                                Glanzstoff</em>]<em>, liquidated damages apply
                                only where the contractor had completed the contract and not when
                                their employment had been terminated and control of the contract
                                passed out of their hands</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In LW’s appeal on the first question of
                    law, I have concluded that a claim to liquidated damages may still be brought
                    even where the sub-contract has been terminated, provided that the liquidated
                    damages claimed relate only to the period between the agreed completion date and
                    the termination date (in the absence of express contractual stipulation to the
                    contrary). Therefore, events which occur after termination, such as the
                    appointment of other sub-contractors to complete the works, should not affect
                    the ability of a contractor to mount such a claim (again, in the absence of
                    express contractual stipulation to the contrary), although the total quantum of
                    such a claim may be subject to subsequent certificates. Thus, I allow LW’s
                    appeal on the second question of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     LW argues that the Arbitrator erred when he
                    decided that, in its claim for <em>liquidated</em> damages,
                    it was required to prove the extent of loss suffered which was attributable to
                    LCS’s breach of contract in the latter’s delay in completion of the
                    works. After the Award was made, LW requested on 2 July 2010 an additional award
                    pursuant to s 43(4) of the Act; according to LW, the omitted claim was for
                    liquidated damages between 5 November 2002 and 12 May 2003. Five days later, the
                    Arbitrator rejected this request on the ground that he had already dealt with
                    LW’s claims for general and liquidated damages for the entire period,
                        <em>ie</em>, from 31 October 2002 to 28 July 2003. In
                    so doing, he allegedly implied that cl 24 did in fact “apply” to
                    the claim for liquidated damages but that the claim had failed because LW had
                    failed to prove the loss which was attributable to LCS’s
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Arbitrator repeated his finding that cl 24
                    did not survive termination, and that therefore he rejected the post-termination
                    claim of liquidated damages. He then stated that, in relation to
                    “pre-termination damages (<em>liquidated or
                        otherwise</em>)”, he had rejected this claim due to LW’s
                    failure to prove the loss attributable to LCS’s breach. Although this
                    latter wording was somewhat imprecise, it is clear that the Arbitrator did not
                    change his mind on the issue and implications of whether cl 24 survived
                    termination. This reflected his error on the first and second questions of law.
                    In any event, if the letter had purported to decide the substance of LW’s
                    claim then it would have no legal effect because the Arbitrator would be
                        <em>functus officio</em> once the Award was issued on
                    29 June 2010: s 44(1). Thus, I dismiss the appeal on the third question of
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Remedies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As I have allowed LW’s appeals on the
                    first and second questions of law, the question of remedies has to be
                    considered. In its originating summons, LW prayed for the Award “to be
                    varied, set aside or be remitted to the arbitral tribunal for
                    reconsideration”. During the course of argument, it became clear that
                    LW’s preferred remedy was a variation of the Award so that its claim for
                    $945,000 as liquidated damages between 5 November 2002 and 12 May 2003 is
                    allowed. The court’s remedial jurisdiction in an appeal on a question of
                    law arising out of an award is provided by s 49(8) of the Act, which is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On an appeal under this section, the Court may by order —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">confirm the award;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">vary the award;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">remit the award to the arbitral tribunal, in whole
                            or in part, for reconsideration in the light of the Court’s
                            determination; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(d)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">set aside the award in whole or in
                        part.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The difficulty with LW’s preferred
                    remedy is that such a variation requires a finding that LW <em>was entitled</em> to all the liquidated damages claimed for that
                    particular period; this is a finding which necessarily requires that <em>all</em> the prerequisites of such a claim have <em>in fact</em> been satisfied. Because the Arbitrator rejected
                    LW’s claim of liquidated damages on the preliminary point of law that no
                    such claim could be brought after termination of the sub-contract, he did not
                    proceed to determine whether the other prerequisites were met. Although it is
                    undisputed that the sub-contract works were not completed by the extended
                    completion date of 4 November 2002, the Arbitrator did not deal with the issue
                    of whether the required notice was given by LW pursuant to cl 24.1. In <em>Fence Gate Limited v NEL Construction Limited</em> (2001) 82
                    Con LR 41, Judge Thornton QC observed at [93]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that <em>the power to vary ought ordinarily only
                            to be used where the necessary fact-finding has already been completed
                            by the arbitrator and the necessary answer is self-evident</em>.
                        Where a further role is to be performed by the arbitrator, particularly if
                        there <em>is insufficient information in the award to enable
                            the court to decide on the appropriate variation to make to the award in
                            the light of its findings on the questions of law</em> that have
                        led to the appeal succeeding, the appropriate remedy would normally be to
                        remit the award for his reconsideration...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar approach was adopted in <em>Marc Rich &amp;
                        Co AG v Beogradska Plovidba (The “Avala”)</em> [1994] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 363 at 365 by Tuckey J, who stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I am not persuaded that but for the concession the arbitrator would or
                        should necessarily have decided the point in favour of [the] charterers...
                        [E]ven if I had concluded that the award did raise a question of law
                            <em>I would not have felt able to determine the issues
                            between the parties on the facts presently found by the
                            arbitrator</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Although I am of the opinion that the required
                    notice under cl 24.1 was satisfied by LW’s letter of 2 January 2003, this
                    was a matter which was to be decided by arbitration pursuant to the
                    parties’ intentions as encapsulated in Art 5 of the sub-contract. It would
                    not be appropriate for the requested variation to be ordered in the absence of
                    sufficient findings by the Arbitrator to support it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For the above reasons, I allow LW’s
                    appeal on the first and second questions of law. Accordingly, I remit the Award
                    to the Arbitrator, pursuant to s 49(8)(c), for reconsideration on the issue
                    of whether LW was entitled to liquidated damages between 5 November 2002 and 12
                    May 2003, in light of my finding that a claim to liquidated damages for that
                    period, being the period after the extended contractual completion date but
                    before termination of the sub-contract, is not excluded by termination or the
                    fact that control over the works had passed out of LCS’s
                hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The appeal on the third question of law is
                    dismissed because it is not brought against a question of law arising out of an
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As LW has been successful in its appeal on two
                    of the three questions of law, I award costs for this appeal to LW. As for the
                    costs of the Arbitration, I remit this issue, pursuant to s 49(8)(c), to the
                    Arbitrator for reconsideration in the light of my decision on the first and
                    second questions of law and of the decision which he eventually reaches on
                    LW’s claim for liquidated damages for the specified period.</p>
