<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused persons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused persons are two Malaysian Chinese
                    from Penang, Malaysia. The first accused is Lim Boon Hiong
                    (“Lim”), 29 years old, and the second accused is Koay Teen Chew
                    (“Koay”), 30 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Prosecution proceeded against Lim and Koay
                    on one joint charge of drug trafficking (“the Charge”), <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[That you both] on the 28th day of May 2008 at or about 7.40pm in a
                        Malaysian registered motor car JKR 7393 along Dunearn Road approaching
                        Newton Circus in Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you
                        both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First
                        Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your
                        possession inside the said car for the purpose of trafficking two hundred
                        and nineteen (219) packets of substance containing not less than 120.96
                        grams of diamorphine without any authorisation under the said Act or the
                        Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under
                        section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and
                        section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 and punishable under section 33 of
                        the Misuse of Drug Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Surveillance operation leading to Lim and Koay’s
                arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Prosecution led evidence to show that on
                    28 May 2008, at about 4.30pm, a party of officers from the Central
                    Narcotics Bureau (the “CNB officers”) was tasked to conduct
                    surveillance on a Malaysian registered car JKR 7393 (“the
                    car”) at the Woodlands Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At about 6.10pm on 28 May 2008, the CNB
                    officers observed Lim and Koay entering Singapore from Johor Bahru at the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint in the car. The car made its way into the heartlands,
                    stopping first at Causeway Point in Woodlands where a male Chinese (subsequently
                    ascertained to be Koay) alighted from the car and boarded a taxi. Thereafter the
                    taxi and the car left together and proceeded to Bukit Timah Shopping Centre
                    where Koay alighted from the taxi and reboarded the car. The car then travelled
                    to, and stopped at, a Shell petrol kiosk along Upper Bukit Timah Road. The CNB
                    officers took up various positions nearby in order to continue the
                    surveillance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the petrol kiosk, both Lim and Koay were
                    observed by the CNB officers to have alighted from the car to use a restroom and
                    visit a convenience store, respectively. When they returned, Koay went to the
                    rear passenger seat of the car while Lim returned to the driver’s seat.
                    Subsequently, Koay moved to the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At about 7pm, the CNB officers observed a male
                    Chinese, later ascertained to be PW21, Goh Kong Seng (“Goh”),
                    walking up to the front passenger window of the car (there is some dispute as to
                    whether Goh walked up to the front passenger window or the driver’s window
                    but nothing turns on this), reaching in through the window and collecting a
                    black bundle from one of the accused persons. Koay testified in court that he
                    was the one who handed over the black bundle to Goh who then placed the black
                    bundle in his left trouser pocket before leaving in another car. Goh was
                    arrested later the same day (28 May 2008) and the black bundle that Goh had
                    collected at the petrol kiosk was seized. It was found to be labelled
                    “B”. Analysis of the contents of the black bundle by the Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”) revealed that the bundle contained
                    diamorphine, which is the scientific name for heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Lim and Koay then left the petrol kiosk, and
                    were travelling along Dunearn Road towards Newton Circus when they were
                    intercepted and arrested by the CNB officers, and their identities
                    ascertained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Questioning of Lim and Koay at Dunearn Road</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Lim and Koay were then questioned at the scene
                    by a number of CNB officers. None of the following sets of questions and answers
                    were reduced to writing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Senior Staff Sergeant Ng Yeong Kok
                        (“SSSgt Ng”) (PW11) asked Koay, in Mandarin, whether he had
                        anything illegal in the car to surrender, and Koay said “no”.
                        He then asked Koay what he was doing in Singapore, and Koay replied that he
                        had come to shop with his friend, but was unable to furnish details as to
                        where he had gone shopping or intended to shop. The same set of questions
                        was posed to Lim in Mandarin, and Lim claimed that he did not know if there
                        was anything illegal in the car to surrender, nor did he know why he had
                        come to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Staff Sergeant Malvern Wong (“SSgt Wong”) (PW14) also
                        questioned Lim in Mandarin at the scene. He asked Lim whether there was
                        anything illegal in the car, and Lim replied that there were
                        “things” in the loudspeaker in the car. When asked by SSgt
                        Wong what these “things” were, Lim replied that he did not
                        know.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Senior
                        Station Inspector Sea Hoon Cheng (“SSI Sea”) (PW12) asked Koay
                        five questions in Hokkien:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       SSI Sea asked Koay whether
                            he had anything illegal to surrender, to which Koay replied
                            “no”;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       SSI Sea asked Koay whether there was anything
                            illegal in the car, to which Koay replied “not
                            mine”;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       SSI Sea asked Koay what that was, and Koay
                            replied that he did not know;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       SSI Sea repeated the question, to which Koay
                            replied that it was in the car speaker but that it did not belong to
                            him;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_v"></a>(v)       SSI Sea asked Koay how he knew about it, and Koay indicated that Lim
                            was the one who told him that there were illegal “things”
                            in the car speaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Station Inspector David Ng (“SI David Ng”)
                        (PW13) asked Lim in Mandarin whether there was anything inside the car, to
                        which Lim replied “yes”. When asked by SI David Ng where the
                        things were, Lim replied that they were “behind the car boot”.
                        SI David Ng then asked Lim “how many behind the car boot”, and
                        Lim replied “5” or “about
                5”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Search of the car at Dunearn Road</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The car was searched by the CNB officers at the
                    scene, and a loudspeaker was found in the boot of the car. SSI Sea was informed
                    by SI David Ng that Lim had said that there were things inside the car boot, but
                    SSI Sea could not find any opening in the loudspeaker, and decided, in view of
                    the poor lighting and traffic conditions, to continue the search at the
                    headquarters of the CNB (“CNB HQ”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arrival at CNB HQ and initial statements recorded from Lim and
                Koay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Shortly after arriving at CNB HQ on the same
                    day (28 May 2008), at about 9.15pm, SSI Sea questioned Koay in a mixture of
                    Hokkien and Cantonese, and obtained a statement (P35) from Koay, which SSI Sea
                    reduced to writing in his pocketbook as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q1    What do you call the person who was arrested
                            together with you?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A1    I call him Ah Lim (Recorder’s note: Ah Lim is
                            one Lim Boon Hiong, IC: 801214075033).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q2    Were you arrested together with Ah Lim in the car
                            JKR 7393?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A2    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q3    Who is the driver of the car JKR
                        7393?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A3    Ah Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q4    Is there anything illegal in the car JKR
                            7393?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A4    Yes. In the speaker. (Recorder’s note: The
                            accused answer me in the Cantonese)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q5    How do you know that the speaker of the car JKR
                            7393 has things? (Asked in Cantonese)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A5    Ah Lim told me. (In Cantonese)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q6    When did Ah Lim told you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A6    I do not remember.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q7    What things is there inside the
                        speaker?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A7    Ah Lim just told me got things.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Shortly thereafter, at about 9.25pm, SSSgt Ng
                    questioned Lim in Mandarin and obtained a statement (P32) from Lim, which SSSgt
                    Ng reduced to writing in his pocketbook as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q1    Why did you come into Singapore
                        today?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A1    My friend “Banana” asked me to send
                            him to Singapore?</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A2    Take something for people.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q3    What thing?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A3    He said “medicine”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q4    For what, do you send him in for?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A4    He pays me a few hundred dollars between RM$500 to
                            RM$800.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q5    How many did he bring today?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A5    About 5 to 6 packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q6    Who is the person who ask you to drive in?
                            (Recorder’s note: B1 [Lim] pointed to Koay Teen Chew
                            A17767491)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A6    “Banana” or “Zhen
                            Xing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Search of the car at CNB HQ</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At about 9.45pm, the car was searched by SSI
                    Sea in the presence of Lim and Koay. When the boot of the car was opened, a
                    loudspeaker was found just behind the rear seat (as shown in photographs P3 and
                    P4). SSI Sea was unable to find any opening in the loudspeaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     During the search, SI David Ng asked Koay how
                    to open the loudspeaker, and Koay replied that there was an opening behind the
                    loudspeaker. With this information, SSI Sea located a concealed opening at the
                    back of the loudspeaker (as shown in photograph P5) which, when opened, revealed
                    a compartment, within which SSI Sea found 8 bundles each secured with black
                    masking tape. The 8 bundles were already labelled “A”,
                    “C”, “D”, “E1”, “E2”,
                    “E3”, “E4” and “E5” when they were
                    found, and contained small packets of granular/powdered substance. As stated in
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the bundle labelled
                    “B” was earlier delivered to Goh at the Shell petrol kiosk prior
                    to the arrest of Lim and Koay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Further statements recorded from Lim and Koay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At about 10.08pm on the same day (28 May
                    2008), SSSgt Ng questioned Lim in Mandarin, and obtained a further statement
                    from Lim in Mandarin (P33) which SSSgt Ng reduced to writing in his pocketbook
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q7    What is this? (Recorder’s note: I pointed to

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Police report lodged against Lim and Koay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 28 May 2008, at about 11.20pm, SSSgt
                    Ng lodged a police report (P34) pertaining to the arrest of Lim and Koay as well
                    as the exhibits recovered from the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     SSSgt Ng initially classified the case as both
                    consumption and trafficking of controlled drugs under s 8(b)(ii) and
                    s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”). Lim and Koay were also sent for instant urine tests
                    (“IUT”) in order to determine whether they had, in fact, consumed
                    controlled drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The IUT results revealed that Lim tested
                    negative for controlled drugs, while Koay tested positive for benzodiazepines.
                    Their urine samples were subsequently sent to the HSA for proper analysis, and
                    certificates from the HSA revealed that they tested negative for all controlled
                    drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">HSA analysis of the exhibits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The 8 bundles recovered from the boot of the
                    car contained a total of 219 small packets of granular/powdered substance. There
                    was initially some dispute as to the number of packets that were sent to the HSA
                    for analysis. Exhibit B1A-Photograph P11 showed a total number of 29 packets
                    while ASP Richard Soh (PW15) stated at para 29 of his witness statement (PS34)
                    that it was only 28 packets. Exhibit B2A-Photograph P13 showed a total number of
                    30 packets while para 29 of ASP Richard Soh’s witness statement referred
                    to 31 packets. ASP Richard Soh explained in cross-examination that it was
                    possible that he may have accidentally moved a packet from Exhibit B1A to
                    Exhibit B2A but that the total number of packets remained the same. ASP Richard
                    Soh’s explanation was accepted by Counsel for Lim and Koay. The bundles
                    were then sent to the HSA for analysis, the result of which indicated that they
                    contained not less than 120.96 grams of diamorphine. Lim and Koay did not
                    challenge the analysis by the HSA or the weight of the seized
                    diamorphine.</p>

                        is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession
                        appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or
                        promise having reference to the charge against the accused person,
                        proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the

                        avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Lim claimed that the four long statements were
                    inadmissible under s 24 of the EA on account of an inducement or promise
                    that was allegedly proffered to him by Mr Wu on 29 May 2008, sometime
                    between 6.09pm and 6.16pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was Lim’s case that, on that date and
                    at that time, just prior to the recording of the first long statement (P39),
                    while he was having his dinner in Room B0312A of CNB HQ, he had pleaded with
                    Mr Wu in Cantonese to spare his life, and asked him for the minimum
                    sentence in respect of the offence of drug-trafficking with which he was
                    charged, <em>viz</em> 5 years’ imprisonment and 5
                    strokes of the cane, as he did not want to die. In response to this alleged
                    plea, Mr Wu allegedly told Lim that he (Lim) would receive 5 years’
                    imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane if he made admissions in his statement.
                    As a result of and in reliance on this alleged representation or promise by
                    Mr Wu, Lim then gave the first long statement to ASP Richard Soh. Lim also
                    maintained that the inducement by Mr Wu continued to operate on his mind
                    when he gave the second (P42), third (P44) and fourth (P51) long statements. Lim
                    explained that he asked Mr Wu for the sentence of 5 years’
                    imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane because he was told by ASP Richard Soh
                    (through the interpretation of Mr Wu) that this was the minimum sentence
                    for the charge during the recording of the cautioned statement (D1) under
                    s 122(6) of the CPC. At the time, the purity of the diamorphine had not
                    been scientifically determined by the HSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It was common ground that Lim was indeed
                    informed that the minimum sentence for the charge could be 5 years’
                    imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane while the maximum sentence would be the
                    death penalty. Strictly speaking this may not be correct. At the time the
                    minimum sentence was mentioned, the purity of the seized drugs had not been
                    ascertained and, given that a charge had to be preferred against Lim within 48
                    hours of his arrest, the charge would have been based on the gross weight of the
                    drugs seized, which in Lim’s case was about 1.5 kilograms. Based on the
                    weight of the diamorphine stated in the charge when the cautioned statement was
                    recorded from Lim, the only sentence (if Lim was convicted) would be the
                    mandatory death sentence. This practice of informing the accused, prior to the
                    determination of the purity of the seized drugs, that the minimum sentence could
                    be 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane should perhaps be
                    reviewed. Alternatively, if this practice should continue, it would be advisable
                    for the CNB officers to clearly state on the cautioned statement itself that the
                    circumstances under which the minimum sentence would apply have been fully
                    explained to the accused. Such a practice will ensure that there is no
                    possibility of confusion by the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, it should be made clear
                    that it was not Lim’s case that the <em>mere
                        fact</em> that he had been informed, whether by ASP Richard Soh or by
                    Mr Wu, that the minimum sentence was 5 years’ imprisonment and 5
                    strokes of the cane, instead of the more likely sentence of death (based on the
                    weight of the drugs seized from the car), constituted an inducement or promise.
                    Nor is it alleged that ASP Richard Soh had deliberately misled Lim in so
                    informing him. Instead, the inducement or promise which Lim alleged was based
                    entirely on the representation or promise that Mr Wu was said to have
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Prosecution’s case was that Lim made
                    the first to fourth long statements voluntarily, and its main submission was
                    that the alleged conversation in Cantonese between Lim and Mr Wu never took
                    place, <em>ie</em> that Lim’s contention that
                    Mr Wu induced him into making the long statements was a lie.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Elements of s 24 of the EA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The law relating to the application of
                    s 24 of the EA is well settled. In <em>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619
                        (“<em>Kelvin Chai</em>”), Yong Pung How
                    CJ stated at [53] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test for determining admissibility under s 24 is, first, whether
                        the confession was made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or
                        promise, and second, whether in making that confession, the accused did so
                        in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would have led him
                        reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or would
                        avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are questions of fact
                        and are matters of judicial evaluation: see <em>Seow Choon
                            Meng v PP</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 338 and <em>Tan Boon Tat v PP</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 698,
                        following <em>DPP v Ping Lin</em>
                        [1976] AC 574. The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner
                        which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is
                        satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective
                        limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the
                        particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected
                        with the charge: <em>Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP</em>
                        [1983] 2 MLJ 232 and <em>Md Desa bin Hashim v PP</em>
                        [1995] 3 MLJ 350</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The only question in this case was the
                    objective one of whether there had been an inducement or promise by Mr Wu,
                    for Lim testified that it was because of Mr Wu’s alleged
                    representation or promise that he gave his long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this respect, the Prosecution and defence
                    counsel disagreed on the appropriate test as regards the burden of
                proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Burden of proof under s 24 of the EA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Mr Tiwary, for Lim, submitted that it was
                    for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Lim’s four
                    long statements had been voluntarily made, and that it was therefore sufficient
                    for Lim to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether or not there had been any
                    inducement or promise. Mr Ng, for the Prosecution, while accepting that it
                    had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the long statements had
                    been made by Lim voluntarily, nonetheless contended that the court first had to
                    find, as a fact, that there had been inducement, in order to conclude that a
                    reasonable doubt had been raised as to the voluntariness of Lim’s
                    statements. In other words, it was not enough, according to the Prosecution, for
                    doubts to be entertained as to whether or not there had been inducement:
                    inducement had to be found as a matter of fact, and this the accused bore the
                    burden of proving on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Prosecution’s submissions were
                    however not borne out by the authorities. Yong CJ at [53] of <em>Kelvin Chai</em>, in a passage immediately following the one quoted
                    above at [31], stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also established that where voluntariness is challenged, the burden
                        is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession
                        was made voluntarily and not for the Defence to prove on a balance of
                        probabilities that the confession was not made voluntarily: <em>Koh Aik Siew v PP</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 885.
                        However, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words,
                        it is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the
                        existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow
                        of influence or remnants of fear: <em>Panya Martmontree v
                            PP</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear, therefore, that, in order for a
                    confession to be rendered inadmissible under s 24 of the EA, a trial judge
                    need <em>not</em> find, as a matter of fact on a balance of
                    probabilities, that there had been inducement. It is sufficient if there is a
                    reasonable doubt as to the existence of an inducement and/or
                promise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It should be stressed, however, that what is
                    required is a <em>reasonable</em> doubt, and not merely
                    speculative or conjectural doubts arising from the slightest suspicion of an
                    inducement: <em>Panya Martmontree v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 at [32].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     After examining the evidence of Lim together
                    with the evidence of ASP Richard Soh, I was not satisfied that a reasonable
                    doubt existed as to the voluntariness of Lim’s long statements for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     I found it difficult to believe that
                        Lim would have pleaded with Mr Wu, a man he had just met, and further,
                        a man he had been introduced to as an <em>interpreter</em>, for his life;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     I found it equally unbelievable that Mr Wu
                        would, of his own accord, make the alleged representation or promise to Lim,
                        for no apparent reason, especially when ASP Richard Soh was present and
                        seated next to him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, given Mr Wu’s experience as an interpreter with
                        the CNB for a number of years and his limited and specific role as an
                        interpreter during the statement recording process, I found it improbable
                        that Mr Wu would have volunteered the alleged inducement or
                        promise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     ASP
                        Richard Soh, who gave cogent and convincing evidence, testified that Lim
                        could not have said anything to Mr Wu without him hearing it, as both
                        Mr Wu and ASP Richard Soh were seated next to each other and almost
                        equidistant from Lim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     ASP Richard Soh testified forthrightly that he would have recorded
                        the alleged conversation between Mr Wu and Lim in his investigation
                        diary, if such a conversation had transpired, and it was not in dispute that
                        no such record was made in ASP Richard Soh’s investigation
                        diary;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_f"></a>(f)     It was
                        highly implausible that ASP Richard Soh missed the alleged conversation, as
                        Mr Tiwary suggested, because he was preoccupied with some other
                        activity, given that Lim was in the room for the specific purpose of being
                        interrogated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_g"></a>(g)     It was also extremely unlikely that ASP Richard Soh had heard the
                        conversation but either chose not to or forgot to record it, given that it
                        occurred so abruptly and was on such an important matter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_h"></a>(h)     I found it deeply improbable that Lim
                        would have spoken to Mr Wu in Cantonese as, by his own testimony, he
                        did not even know at that time if Mr Wu was conversant in Cantonese
                        (the earlier s 122(6) statement had been recorded in
                    Mandarin).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Tiwary placed emphasis on the fact
                    that ASP Richard Soh did not record in either his investigation diary or his
                    witness statement that he had explained the punishment for the intermediate
                    category of trafficking between 10 to 14.99 grams of diamorphine to Lim when the
                    cautioned statement (D1) was recorded. In my view, the omission by ASP Richard
                    Soh did not give rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr Wu had
                    proffered the alleged inducement or promise to Lim on a separate and subsequent
                    occasion on 29 May 2008 between 6.09pm to 6.17pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Based on my observations of the behaviour and
                    demeanour of Lim as well as ASP Richard Soh during their respective testimonies
                    in the <em>voir dire</em>, I was satisfied that the
                    Prosecution had discharged its burden in establishing, beyond a reasonable
                    doubt, the voluntariness of Lim’s long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Proceeding from a person in authority”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Even assuming that Mr Wu had made the
                    alleged representation or promise to Lim, there was an additional difficulty
                    facing Lim in his attempt to rely on s 24 of the EA: the confession must
                    have been caused by an inducement or promise “proceeding from a <em>person in authority</em>” [emphasis
                added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Mr Tiwary submitted, and Mr Ng
                    accepted, during the course of oral arguments, that an interpreter could
                    “constructively” be a person in authority, if he proffered an
                    inducement or promise in the presence and to the knowledge of a person in
                    authority, unless the latter took steps to dissociate himself from the
                    inducement or promise. Mr Tiwary suggested that the interpreter in such
                    circumstances could be deemed to be a person in authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The basis for these submissions appeared to be
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 10
                    (LexisNexis: Singapore, 2006 Reissue, 2006) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at para [120.121]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person may also be constructively in authority. Thus, an interpreter
                        acting in the course of police investigations as an interpreter… is a
                        person in authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     
          <em>Public Prosecutor v Syed
                        Abdul Aziz bin Syed Mohd Noor</em> [1992] 5 CLAS 10 (“<em>Syed Abdul Aziz</em>”) at 14 and <em>R
                        v Cleary</em> (1963) 48 Cr App R 116 at 119 were cited by <em>Halbury’s</em> as authorities for this
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In my view, however, neither of these two
                    cases, properly understood, stands for the proposition for which they are cited.
                    In <em>Syed Abdul Aziz</em> the statement by the accused to
                    the interpreter was set aside, not because of any inducement found by the court
                    to have been proffered by the interpreter, but because certain procedural
                    requirements had not been followed. In <em>R v Cleary</em>,
                    remarks to the accused by the accused’s father, <em>in the
                        presence and hearing of the investigating police officers</em>, were
                    held by the English Court of Criminal Appeal to be capable of amounting to an
                    inducement (see, to similar effect, <em>R v Moore</em>
                    (1972) 56 Cr App R 373).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     When can an interpreter be considered to be a
                    person in authority, constructively or otherwise? If the inducement or promise
                    is made by the interpreter in a <em>one-on-one
                        conversation</em> with the accused (when the accused is aware that he
                    is merely an interpreter), there can be no doubt that admissions made by the
                    accused following the inducement emanating <em>solely</em>
                    from the interpreter would still be admissible. This is because such an
                    interpreter would not be regarded as a “person in authority”,
                        <em>ie</em> “anyone who has authority or control
                    over the accused or over the proceedings or the prosecution against him”
                        (<em>Deokinanan v The Queen</em> [1969]
                    1 AC 20 at 33). Such an inducement would effectively be made by an
                    interpreter or any other person not in authority “on a frolic of his
                    own”, and would not in law exclude a confession thereby obtained: J H
                    Buzzard, R May and M N Howard, <em>Phipson on Evidence</em>
                    (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1982), at para
                    22-30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Would the position be different if the
                    inducement or promise is made by the interpreter in the presence of an
                    investigating officer who has <em>actual</em> authority
                    over the accused? The position here is more complicated, as a number of elements
                    must be considered and balanced, <em>eg</em> the actions of
                    the person in actual authority, the viewpoint of an objective observer and the
                    subjective perspective of the accused. Four situations may be
                    distinguished:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     Where the person in actual authority
                            <em>hears</em> the inducement or promise, and the
                        accused subjectively knows or believes the former heard the inducement or
                        promise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where
                        the person in actual authority does <em>not</em> hear
                        the inducement or promise, but could reasonably have been expected to hear
                        it, and the accused subjectively believes the former heard the inducement or
                        promise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     Where
                        the person in actual authority does <em>not</em> hear
                        the inducement or promise, and could <em>not</em>
                        reasonably have been expected to hear it, but the accused subjectively
                        believes the former heard it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     Regardless of whether the person in actual authority
                        heard the inducement, the accused neither knows nor believes that the former
                        heard it, or is indifferent as to whether the former heard it or
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">An interpreter, in my view, could in principle be
                    regarded as a person in <em>constructive</em> authority if
                    his inducement or promise to the accused was made in the presence of a person in
                        <em>actual</em> authority <em>provided</em> the accused subjectively believed, on reasonable
                    grounds, that the person in actual authority heard the inducement or promise
                    made by the interpreter and took no step to dissociate himself from it
                        (<em>ie</em> situations (a) and (b) above). Where the
                    accused has no reasonable grounds to believe, or does not even believe, that the
                    person in actual authority heard the inducement or promise (<em>ie</em> situations (c) and (d) above), then the interpreter cannot be
                    clothed with constructive authority, for the accused is not relying on any
                    actual authority at all, but is relying instead on his own subjective viewpoint
                    and beliefs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Here, Lim stopped short of saying that he
                    believed ASP Richard Soh heard the inducement or promise from Mr Wu and, by
                    his silence adopted it. Instead, Lim testified that he was <em>not sure</em> whether ASP Richard Soh heard the alleged
                    representation. There is simply no evidence that Lim made the admissions in his
                    long statements because he believed that ASP Richard Soh had adopted the alleged
                    inducement through his silence. As far as Lim was concerned, the inducement came
                    from Mr Wu and he (Lim) was indifferent as to whether ASP Richard Soh had
                    heard it. In such circumstances, Mr Wu cannot be clothed with constructive
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion for the voir dire</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For all the reasons set out in <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>?<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>, I found that Lim’s four long statements were
                    voluntarily made and therefore admissible. After the outcome of the <em>voir dire</em> was delivered, both Lim and Koay applied for
                    all the evidence adduced in the <em>voir dire</em> to be
                    admitted in the main trial. Mr Ng on behalf of the Prosecution confirmed
                    that he had no objection to their application.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In order to convict Lim and Koay on the
                    Charge, the Prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (<em>Raman Selvam s/o Renganathan v Public Prosecutor</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 550 at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim and Koay were in physical
                        custody or control of the 219 packets of substances (packed in 8 bundles
                        – see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) containing not
                        less than 120.96 grams of diamorphine found in the car;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim and Koay knew that the bundles
                        contained diamorphine;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     Lim and Koay were in possession of the diamorphine for
                        the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Only elements (b) and (c) are
                    in controversy, as it is not disputed that Lim and Koay were jointly in physical
                    custody of the bundles of diamorphine found in the car. However, as the element
                    of “possession” in s 5(2) of the Act consists of both
                    physical control and knowledge of the thing possessed (see <em>Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner</em> [1969]
                    2 AC 256 (“<em>Warner</em>”);
                        <em>Tan Ah Tee v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1979?1980] SLR(R) 311), the Prosecution must also prove that Lim and
                    Koay knew that they had the bundles of diamorphine in their custody, in order to
                    prove that Lim and Koay were in “possession” of the diamorphine
                    within the meaning of s 5(2). The Prosecution must then go on to prove that
                    Lim and Koay were in possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of
                    trafficking, either by direct proof or by reliance on the presumption of
                    trafficking in s 17 of the Act, or both. As will be seen, Lim and
                    Koay’s principal defence is that they did not know of the existence of the
                    bundles in the car, and/or that the bundles contained diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Knowledge that the bundles contained diamorphine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Prosecution sought to prove that both Lim
                    and Koay knew that the bundles they had in their joint possession contained
                    diamorphine, although Mr Ng submitted that different types of knowledge
                    were to be ascribed to Koay and Lim respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     With regard to Koay, the Prosecution pointed
                    to specific portions of his various long statements where Koay had made a number
                    of incriminating admissions (paras 6?7 of P40; paras 9, 12 and 17 of P41 as well
                    as paras 39 and 44 of P46) as establishing that Koay had, on the basis of direct
                    evidence, actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em> (see
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>”), as well as [65]?[75] below, for the
                    distinction between actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>
                    and wilful blindness) that the bundles contained diamorphine. It is apparent
                    that insofar as Koay is concerned, if he cannot successfully distance himself
                    from his long statements by satisfying me that they should be given no weight at
                    all, the admissions contained therein would prove the Prosecution’s case
                    that Koay had actual knowledge that the bundles contained
                diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     With regard to Lim, the position is not quite
                    the same. Unlike Koay, there is no express admission by Lim in any of his four
                    long statements that he actually knew that the bundles contained diamorphine.
                    Instead, in his long statements, Lim merely admitted that he was aware that the
                    bundles contained drugs and that he suspected that the drugs were heroin.
                    Accordingly, with regard to Lim, his long statements do not <em>ipso facto</em> prove that Lim knew that the bundles contained
                    diamorphine. In these circumstances, the Prosecution, quite rightly, chose not
                    to rely on actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>. Instead,
                    the Prosecution submitted that, given the manner in which the bundles were
                    wrapped and concealed, as well as the surreptitious nature of the delivery to
                    Goh at the petrol kiosk, Lim must have known that the bundles contained
                    diamorphine, on the basis that he was <em>wilfully
                        blind</em> as to the nature of the contents of the bundles, which
                    wilful blindness was, on the authority of <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, to be treated as the legal equivalent of actual
                    knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether it is necessary for the Prosecution to prove that Lim and
                Koay knew that the controlled drug was diamorphine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I have, in the course of this judgment,
                    proceeded on the basis that the knowledge which the Prosecution is required to
                    prove, in order to make out the element of possession, and hence the Charge, is
                    that Lim and Koay knew the <em>specific nature</em> of the
                    drugs they were found with, <em>ie</em> that the
                    Prosecution had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Lim and Koay knew that
                    the bundles contained <em>diamorphine</em>, and not just a
                        <em>controlled drug</em> (“the narrow
                    approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This is a matter of some controversy, and was
                    left unresolved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>. The approach I have adopted was assumed (but not decided)
                    to be the correct approach under s 18(2) of the Act in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> itself, where the Court of Appeal contrasted the
                    narrow approach with a broader approach, <em>viz</em> that
                    the accused need only know that the drug in his possession is a controlled drug
                    (“the broad approach”). The broad approach was strongly endorsed
                    by the House of Lords in <em>Warner</em>, and is consistent
                    with the general policy underlying the Act, as well as some of the language
                    employed by the Act itself (see generally <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [88]-[89]). Nonetheless, in the
                    absence of detailed argument by counsel, and in fairness to the appellant, the
                    Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that the narrow approach applied (see
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [92], [93] and
                [95]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In <em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>, the appellant appealed against his conviction in the High Court
                    of the offence of importing heroin under s 7 of the Act, on the basis that,
                    while he knew that he was importing illegal drugs, he did not know the precise
                    nature of the drugs he was carrying, <em>ie</em> he did not
                    know that the drugs contained heroin. As the Court of Appeal noted at [20] of
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, the appellant in that case had
                    to rebut the presumption contained in s 18(2) of the Act in order for his
                    defence to succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In this case, however, the Prosecution is not
                    relying on s 18(2) because it is established that the presumptions of
                    trafficking and possession in ss 17 and 18, respectively, of the Act cannot be
                    utilised in conjunction (see <em>Mohd Halmi bin Hamid and another
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 548 and <em>Low Kok Wai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994]
                    1 SLR(R) 64). The Prosecution opted instead to rely on the presumption
                    of trafficking in s 17 of the Act in preference to the presumption of
                    possession in s 18. This raises the question (“the first
                    question”) of whether the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> are applicable, given that, in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, the issue of whether the broad or narrow
                    approach was more appropriate was considered by the Court of Appeal in the
                    context of s 18(2) of the Act, whereas here that issue is presented in the
                    context of a different provision, <em>viz
                    s </em>5(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In addition, there is the question
                    (“the second question”) of whether I should regard myself as being
                    bound by the Court of Appeal’s observations in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, which were technically <em>obiter</em>, given the Court of Appeal’s holding (at [171]) that,
                    on the evidence, the appellant had had <em>actual
                        knowledge</em> that the drugs he was carrying consisted of
                    heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With regard to the first question, I am of the
                    opinion that <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> cannot be distinguished
                    on the basis that this case involves a consideration of s 5(2) rather than
                    s 18(2) of the Act, as there is no indication in <em>Tan
                        Kiam Peng</em>, or in the Act itself, that s 18(2) requires a
                    court to adopt a narrower approach to knowledge than is required for the purpose
                    of proving the element of possession in s 5(2) of the Act. Indeed, in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> itself, the Court of Appeal
                    observed (at [171]) that, since the appellant had actual knowledge that the
                    drugs he was carrying consisted of heroin (and not merely a controlled drug),
                    there was in fact no need to rely on the presumption under s 18(2), which
                    indicates that the narrow approach is applicable more generally throughout the
                    Act wherever knowledge is required to be proven, regardless of whether
                    s 18(2) is in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As for the second question, although the Court
                    of Appeal’s comments in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> were
                    strictly <em>obiter</em>, having regard to the Court of
                    Appeal’s exhaustive review of the applicable authorities and the
                    comprehensive consideration of the relevant issues, I regard <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> as highly persuasive, if not actually binding,
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Consequently, on the issue of the correct
                    approach to adopt under s 5(2) of the Act, I can do no better than to
                    follow the narrow approach adopted in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, for much the same reasons (see above at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>): there was likewise no detailed argument by
                    counsel in this case on this point, and the ambiguity should, in fairness, be
                    construed in favour of Lim and Koay. In any event, Mr Ng submitted that the
                    Prosecution was content to proceed on the basis of the narrow
                approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I should add, however, that I do not think it
                    would have mattered which approach I adopted, as the Court of Appeal’s
                    comments regarding the <em>secondary</em> issue of the
                        <em>nature of the knowledge</em> an accused person must
                    be proven to have had arguably renders any difference between the narrow and
                    broad approaches moot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>, the Court of Appeal scrutinised the question of knowledge
                    (technically in the context of s 18(2) of the Act, but as I have pointed
                    out above at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>, the question is of
                    general application to the elements of knowledge and possession under the Act),
                    which involved consideration of two separate issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     the <em>primary</em> issue of the <em>scope</em> of
                        knowledge: here, as I have stated, the Court of Appeal took the narrow
                        approach and assumed, without deciding, that an accused person not only has
                        to be shown to know that he was in possession of a controlled drug, but also
                        that he knew that he was in possession of the <em>specific</em> drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     the <em>secondary</em> issue of the
                            <em>nature</em> of the knowledge: here the Court of
                        Appeal explained that “knowledge” refers not only to <em>actual knowledge</em> (what I have termed “actual
                        knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>”), but also to
                            <em>wilful blindness</em>, which is the legal
                        equivalent of actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>
                        (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [104], [121],
                        [123]?[125], [129] and [130]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In relation to this secondary issue, the Court
                    of Appeal made a number of observations regarding the doctrine of wilful
                    blindness, which are worth quoting extensively:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">125    
              <em>[S]uspicion is</em>
                            legally sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness provided the
                            relevant factual matrix warrants such a finding <em>and</em> the accused deliberately decides to turn a blind
                            eye. <em>However</em>, that suspicion must, as Lord
                            Scott perceptively points out in [<em>Manifest Shipping
                                Co Ltd v Uni-Polaris Insurance Co Ltd</em> [2003]
                            1 AC 469], “be firmly grounded and targeted on specific
                            facts”. Mere “untargeted or speculative suspicion”
                            is insufficient… [A] <em>low level</em> of
                            suspicion premised on a factual matrix that would <em>not</em> lead a person to make further inquiries would be
                            insufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness where the person
                            concerned did not in fact make further inquiries… [I]n order for
                            wilful blindness to be established, the appropriate level of suspicion
                            (as just discussed) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition,
                            inasmuch as that level of suspicion <em>must then lead to
                                a refusal to investigate further</em>, thus resulting in
                            “blind eye knowledge”…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    That having been said, the requirement of
                                <em>suspicion</em> is nevertheless a vital
                            (and, indeed, threshold) one. So, for example, if the accused makes
                            merely token inquiries because he suspects that making more substantive
                            inquiries might lead him to the truth which he does not want to know,
                            that is wilful blindness. If the factual matrix was such that the
                            accused ought to have been suspicious, the court must then consider the
                            accused’s reasons for not making further inquiries. … [A]
                            court would be well justified in thinking that the reason why an accused
                            refused to make further inquiries may be because he or she was virtually
                            certain that if further inquiries were made, his or her suspicions would
                            be confirmed. In such a situation, the level of suspicion is… one
                            where a person in the accused’s shoes ought to make further
                            inquiries and the failure to do so would therefore constitute wilful
                            blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">129    [I]n the context of the doctrine of wilful
                            blindness, while some illustrations may be helpful, it is nevertheless
                            imperative to note that, owing to the intensely factual nature of the
                            inquiry, they cannot be representative, let alone comprehensive.
                            Generally speaking, if an accused has had his or her suspicions aroused
                            in the manner set out at [125] above, the accused can still rebut the
                            relevant presumption under s 18 of the Act by demonstrating that he
                            or she took reasonable steps to investigate by making further inquiries
                            that were appropriate to the circumstances. What these circumstances
                            will be will obviously vary from case to case, thus underscoring (once
                            again) the intensely factual nature of the entire process. Nevertheless,
                            one obvious situation is where the accused takes no steps whatsoever to
                            investigate his or her suspicions. The court would naturally find that
                            there was wilful blindness in such a situation. <b><em>Where, for example, an accused is given a wrapped package and is
                                told that it contains counterfeit currency when it actually contains

                                insufficient to obviate a finding of wilful blindness on the part of

                                packets of what are obviously drugs, that ought then to prompt the
                                accused to make further inquiries</em></b>. And, where, in fact,
                            only token efforts are made to investigate one's suspicions, this would
                            be insufficient. <b><em>But might it not be argued that the

                                further? Much will, of course, depend on the precise facts before
                                the court but it would appear, in principle, that merely asking and
                                receiving answers in situations such as that presently considered
                                would be insufficient simply because the accused concerned would
                                certainly be given false answers and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">130    Situations such as that which exists on the facts

                                is carrying, that constitutes, in our view, wilful

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It seems to me, if I may respectfully say so,
                    that these passages, taken to their logical conclusion, effectively eliminate
                    the distinction between the broad and narrow approaches. Taking the Court of
                    Appeal’s example at [129] of <em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where… an accused is given a wrapped package and is told that it
                        contains counterfeit currency when it actually contains controlled drugs,
                        … absent unusual circumstances, the accused should at least ask to
                            <em>actually view</em> what is in the package. Even
                        a query by the accused coupled with a false assurance would … be
                        generally insufficient to obviate a finding of wilful blindness on the part
                        of the accused under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The wilful blindness here is presumably wilful blindness that the
                    package contains <em>a controlled drug</em>, <em>ie</em> the broad approach. Since, however, wilful blindness
                    is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>, the situation is legally no different from one
                    where the accused <em>actually knew</em> that a wrapped
                    package he has been given contains controlled drugs (<em>ie</em> the situation referred to in [130] of <em>Tan
                        Kiam Peng</em>). Consequently, <em>in both
                        situations</em>, since the accused <em>knows</em>
                    (whether by actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em> or by
                    wilful blindness) that the package contains controlled drugs, if he does not
                    take sufficient steps (and it is clear from the Court of Appeal’s
                    observations above that merely asking for, and receiving, assurances is not
                    sufficient), he is <em>wilfully blind</em> as to the
                        <em>specific nature</em> of the drug, <em>ie</em> the narrow approach. The result, therefore, is that
                    once an accused person has a firm or specific suspicion that he is in possession
                    of a controlled drug, and then deliberately refrains from confirming that
                    suspicion, he will not only be held to know, via wilful blindness, that he is in
                    possession of a controlled drug (the broad approach) – he will,
                    ineluctably, also be held to know, via wilful blindness, that he is in
                    possession of the specific drug in question (the narrow approach), since wilful
                    blindness is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is true that Yong Pung How CJ, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Koo Pui Fong</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 734 (“<em>Koo Pui
                    Fong</em>”), while acknowledging (at [14]) that wilful blindness is
                    “simply a reformulation of actual knowledge”, said (at [15]) that
                    “[b]ut this is different from saying that wilful blindness should be
                    automatically equated with knowledge.” It is clear from [127] of
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, however, that all Yong CJ was
                    saying is that actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em> and
                    wilful blindness are <em>conceptually</em> not identical.
                    Indeed, Yong CJ confirmed at [15] of <em>Koo Pui Fong</em>
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Despite the distinction, the practical effect it seems,
                            would usually be the same</em> but the difference should be borne
                        in mind so as not to confuse the concept of wilful blindness as being a
                        separate state of mind which is sufficient to form an alternative to the
                        requirement of knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The <em>practical effect</em>, therefore, of a
                    finding that an accused was wilfully blind to the fact that a package he had
                    been given contained controlled drugs, is <em>the same</em>
                    as a finding that he <em>actually knew</em> that the
                    package contained controlled drugs – in either case he is then wilfully
                    blind as to the specific nature of the drugs if he does not make sufficient
                    inquiries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     This raises the crucial question of what would
                    count as “sufficient” inquiries, if the accused is to prevent a
                    finding of wilful blindness. The authorities on wilful blindness have
                    traditionally referred to the accused “abstain[ing] from making further
                    inquiry” (<em>The English and Scottish Mercantile
                        Investment Company, Limited v Brunton</em> [1892] 2 QB 700
                    at 707), “refrain[ing] from inquiry” (<em>Compania
                        Maritima San Basilo S A v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda)
                        Ltd</em> [1977] QB 49 at 68) or “refus[ing] to
                    investigate” (<em>Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v Uni-Polaris
                        Insurance Co Ltd</em> [2003] 1 AC 469 at [3]). In the
                    context of drug offences, the Court of Appeal in <em>Iwuchukwu
                        Amara Tochi and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 503 at [6] referred to the accused’s “failure to
                    inspect” suspicious articles as an example of wilful
                blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     These statements seem to suggest that as long
                    as the accused makes <em>some</em> inquiry or inspection
                    into the nature of the articles or package in his possession, that may be
                    sufficient to displace a finding of wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>, however, the Court of Appeal commented (at [126]) that merely
                    making “token inquiries” would not be sufficient, and suggested
                    (at [129]) that the accused should at least ask to <em>actually
                        view</em> the contents of the package, for even a query by the accused
                    coupled with a false assurance would be “generally insufficient to
                    obviate a finding of wilful blindness on the part of the accused under such
                    circumstances” (see above at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Even if the accused asks to view the contents
                    of the package, it is not entirely clear whether, on the Court of Appeal’s
                    view, that would be sufficient to prevent a finding of wilful blindness, for the
                    Court of Appeal stated (at [130] (see above at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>)) that if the accused chooses to proceed with his criminal
                    adventure “without establishing the <em>true
                        nature</em> of the drugs he… is carrying, that
                    constitutes… wilful blindness” [emphasis added]. It may be argued
                    that, in the Court of Appeal’s view, the accused must make such inquiries
                    as would be sufficient to enable him to ascertain the specific kind of drug he
                    is in possession of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     If this is what the Court of Appeal meant, I
                    must respectfully observe that such a standard is, in the absence of rigorous
                    scientific analysis, impossible to attain. It is simply not physically possible,
                    on a purely visual inspection, to distinguish with accuracy or certainty between
                    (for instance) powdered heroin and powdered ketamine, or between methamphetamine
                    pills and <em>bona fide</em> pharmacological capsules. This
                    is so where the accused has previously abused the drugs in question, and
                        <em>a fortiori</em> where the accused has had no
                    contact with that type of drug. Assuming, however, that an accused does indeed
                    inspect the contents of a package, and incorrectly satisfies himself as to their
                    nature (<em>eg</em> that the package contains powdered
                    ketamine rather than powdered heroin). Would that be sufficient to avoid a
                    finding of wilful blindness? Adopting the logic in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, it is somewhat difficult to see how, if a query by the
                    accused coupled with a false assurance is insufficient to obviate a finding of
                    wilful blindness, the accused’s false supposition (after visually
                    inspecting the contents of the package) that he is in possession of some other
                    type of controlled drug or <em>bona fide</em> medication
                    would be sufficient. In both cases, after all, the accused has incorrectly
                    satisfied himself that the articles in his possession are not what they truly
                    are.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Indeed, this was the conclusion reached by Tay
                    Yong Kwang J in <em>Public Prosecutor v Khor Soon Lee</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 291 (“<em>Khor Soon
                    Lee</em>”), where Tay J convicted the accused of importing 27.86
                    grams of diamorphine under s 7 of the Act. The accused had been given the
                    diamorphine by one “Tony” in Johor Bahru, but although the accused
                    knew that he had been given drugs, he claimed that he did not know he had been
                    given heroin. Tay J rejected this contention (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), ruling that the accused was wilfully blind as to the
                    nature of the drugs in his possession, on the basis that he was conscious of the
                    fact that he was in possession of controlled drugs, and that there had been
                    ample opportunity for him to inspect the contents of the bag of drugs Tony had
                    given him. At [30], however, Tay J commented:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It might be argued that even if he did open the bundle
                            containing diamorphine that day, he would not have recognized the drug
                            as he claimed that he had not consumed such drug before and did not know
                            what it looked like... Let us assume further that he asked Tony about it
                            and was given a false answer. That would still not rebut the presumption
                            of knowledge</em> because it would rest basically on him trusting
                        Tony’s word. In an illegal transaction such as this, the courier bears
                        the risk that any answer given to him might turn out to be false or wrong.
                        This is quite unlike a legitimate situation which calls for no reason to be
                        suspicious whatsoever. <em>It would tantamount to being
                            wilfully blind</em> (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng v
                            PP</em> at [130]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Here, Tay J’s judgment indicates that an inspection by the
                    accused of the drugs in question <em>and</em> the seeking
                    of assurances would still not be sufficient to avoid a finding of wilful
                    blindness. What, then, would or could be sufficient?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In the circumstances, therefore, I am inclined
                    to think that the Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>
                    did not intend to suggest that the accused must literally ascertain, with
                    scientific accuracy, the true nature of the articles in his possession. Instead,
                    what is required, if the accused is to obviate a finding of wilful blindness, is
                    a demonstration that he “took <em>reasonable</em>
                    steps to investigate by making further inquiries that were appropriate to the
                    circumstances” [emphasis added], and what is reasonable in the
                    circumstances will vary from case to case (see <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> at [129]). In some cases, it may be sufficient for the
                    accused to inspect the contents of a suspicious package, even if he incorrectly
                    satisfies himself as to the nature of those contents, while in other cases, more
                    may be required. It would be futile and impracticable to lay down a general
                    rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In summary, even though the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> clearly desired to distinguish
                    the narrow approach from the broad approach in order to be fair to the accused
                    (see [94] and [95] of <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>), ultimately,
                    in my respectful view, I do not think it matters greatly which approach I chose
                    to adopt in this case, although, as I mentioned at <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> above, consistently with the Prosecution’s
                    submissions, I did eventually adopt the narrow approach when determining whether
                    the Prosecution had proven its case against Lim. In addition, whether an accused
                    will be able to obviate a finding of wilful blindness depends on his level of
                    suspicion and whether he took reasonable steps to investigate by making further
                    inquiries that were appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Having assumed (without deciding) that the
                    narrow approach is to be adopted in this case, it remains for me to consider Lim
                    and Koay’s defences, in order to determine whether the Prosecution has met
                    its burden in relation to both of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lim’s Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Lim’s defence at the trial was
                    essentially that, when he entered Singapore, he had no idea that the car
                    contained the bundles eventually found by the CNB officers within the
                    loudspeaker in the boot of the car, and that he was merely Koay’s driver
                    with no knowledge that the purpose of Koay’s visits was anything other
                    than to meet various people.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Lim’s evidence was that, although he had
                    agreed to drive Koay into Singapore, he thought Koay was coming to Singapore to
                    collect money for one “AJ” (whom Koay had previously mentioned
                    doing work for). Lim had driven Koay into Singapore previously, and on none of
                    those occasions had Lim seen Koay hand anything over to anyone in Singapore, and
                    there was no reason to suspect otherwise on 28 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Lim said that the first time he realised that
                    the loudspeaker had a compartment built into it was on 28 May 2008 at the
                    Shell petrol kiosk. He had just returned from using the toilet when he saw Koay
                    remove a bundle from the area of the rear passenger seat. When he asked Koay
                    what it was, Koay replied “<em>yao</em>”,
                    which Lim understood to mean common medicine. He said he believed Koay because
                    he and Koay were good friends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Tiwary submitted that Lim’s
                    statements at the scene, as well as at CNB HQ, had to be seen in this context:
                    Lim’s statements, in response to being asked whether there was anything
                    illegal in the car, that there were “things” in the car, referred
                    to Lim’s belief that the bundles contained medicine, in reliance on what
                    Koay had told him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Admissions by Lim in his long statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Lim’s defence is completely
                    contradicted, however, by his long statements, in which he made, <em>inter alia</em>, the following admissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim admitted in his first long
                        statement (P39) that he had agreed to act as driver for Koay to deliver
                        drugs in Singapore though he claimed that he was not sure what the specific
                        drugs were. Lim had previously worked in Singapore and was therefore
                        familiar with the roads.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim also admitted in his third long statement (P44) that
                        he knew that there were drugs hidden in a compartment concealed within the
                        loudspeaker of the car. Although he claimed that Koay did not specifically
                        inform him that the drugs were heroin, he “suspected the things were
                        heroin because [he] was paid RM 800 for each packet” (at para
                        40).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     Lim
                        further admitted in P44 that after delivering a bundle to Goh at the Shell
                        petrol kiosk, AJ instructed Koay and him to make another delivery at Jalan
                        Sultan. En route to Jalan Sultan to make the delivery, they were arrested by
                        CNB officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, Lim also admitted in his fourth long statement (P51) that he knew
                        that on 28 May 2008 Koay had collected drugs from someone in a red car
                        at the Holiday Plaza in Johor Bahru on the instructions of AJ for delivery
                        to Singapore. The drugs were then concealed in the compartment inside the
                        loudspeaker in the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Mr Tiwary submitted that Lim’s
                    admissions in his long statements were brought about because of the alleged
                    inducement proffered by Mr Wu. Lim also retracted the contents of his long
                    statements, claiming that they were lies he had concocted. Essentially, Lim
                    maintained the position he had adopted during the <em>voir
                        dire</em>. Mr Tiwary further submitted that although the long
                    statements had been admitted in evidence following the <em>voir
                        dire</em>, it was still necessary to determine the weight to be given
                    to them. In this regard, Mr Tiwary submitted that Lim’s initial
                    statements at the scene of the arrest and at CNB HQ when he denied knowledge of
                    the drugs should be preferred over the long statements. However, Lim did not
                    provide any explanation for the admissions in his long statements other than his
                    allegation that they were lies concocted by him by reason of the inducement by
                    Mr Wu. In view of my earlier findings in the <em>voir
                        dire</em> that there was no such inducement and that therefore the
                    four long statements were voluntarily given, I reject Mr Tiwary’s
                    submission that the admissions in Lim’s long statements should be
                    disregarded in preference to his initial denials at the scene of the arrest or
                    at CNB HQ. It follows that the Prosecution has proven through Lim’s
                    admissions in his long statements that he knew that the bundles that he and Koay
                    were delivering at the time of their arrest contained <em>drugs</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In his Closing Oral Submissions,
                    Mr Tiwary initially accepted that Lim had admitted in his first long
                    statement (P39) that the bundles contained heroin. It was, however, pointed out
                    to Mr Tiwary that there was in fact no such express admission and that P39
                    merely referred to <em>drugs</em> and not specifically to
                        <em>heroin</em>. For this reason, the Prosecution
                    submitted that Lim was at least wilfully blind as to the specific nature of the
                    drugs that were seized from the car. It should be made clear that the doctrine
                    of wilful blindness is relied upon against Lim to prove that he knew that the
                    drugs were <em>heroin</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Applying the law as explained in <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, it is clear to me that by reason of the
                    doctrine of wilful blindness, Lim is taken to have known that the drugs in the
                    car were heroin. As emphasised in [125] of <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em>, “suspicion is a central as well as integral part of
                    the entire doctrine of wilful blindness”, as long as the suspicion is
                    well-founded. By his own evidence, Lim <em>suspected</em>
                    that the drugs were heroin. Here the suspicion by Lim was well grounded. In P44,
                    Lim states that he suspected the drugs were heroin because of the amount he was
                    paid for delivering each packet. This is consistent with the high street value
                    of heroin. Since Lim already knew that he was carrying controlled drugs, he
                    ought to have taken reasonable steps to investigate by making further inquiries,
                        <em>eg</em> by opening the packets and satisfying
                    himself (even if erroneously) that they did not contain heroin. Since Lim took
                    no such steps, and deliberately refrained from confirming his suspicions, I am
                    satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Lim was
                    wilfully blind that the drugs in his physical custody were diamorphine,
                        <em>ie</em> that the Prosecution has proven that Lim
                    was in possession of not less than 120.96 grams of diamorphine for the purposes
                    of s 5(2) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Koay’s Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Koay’s defence at the trial was that he
                    had no knowledge of the bundles concealed in the loudspeaker of the car until he
                    was informed of their existence by AJ <em>after</em> Lim
                    and Koay had entered Singapore. Further he alleged that he had no knowledge that
                    the bundles contained diamorphine. Although Koay did not challenge the
                    admissibility of his long statements, the effect of his evidence at the trial
                    was that no weight should be ascribed to the statements because of his poor
                    understanding of the language he was interviewed in, as well as his mental state
                    at the time. I shall now consider whether Koay’s explanations compromise
                    the veracity of his long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koay’s reasons for coming to Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In support of Koay’s defence that he had
                    no intention to traffic diamorphine on 28 May 2008, and did not know that
                    he was delivering diamorphine, Mr Nathan, for Koay, submitted that Koay had
                    come to Singapore on 28 May 2008 to collect money on behalf of AJ, for AJ
                    was a known moneylender. Koay stated that on all the previous occasions he had
                    come to Singapore, he had never handed anything over to anyone at the behest of
                    AJ, and that, on 28 May 2008, it was only after Lim and Koay had left the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint that Koay received a telephone call from AJ who instructed
                    him to pass something to AJ’s friends on AJ’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Koay’s case was that, during the
                    telephone call, AJ had informed him that the “thing” he was to
                    pass to AJ’s friends was common medicine. Koay also testified that AJ had
                    told him that the medicine was to be found in the loudspeaker in the boot of the
                    car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Consequently, Mr Nathan submitted, Koay
                    did not have knowledge that he was delivering diamorphine, nor did he have
                    knowledge of the true nature of the contents of the bundles: Koay always thought
                    that the bundles contained common medicine, and only discovered that the bundles
                    contained heroin when he was so informed by the CNB officers at the
                    scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In these circumstances, Mr Nathan
                    submitted, there was insufficient evidence to show that Koay had actual
                    knowledge that the bundles contained diamorphine, nor could Koay be said to have
                    knowledge by virtue of being wilfully blind as to the contents of the bundles,
                    since the possibility that the bundles might contain illegal substances never
                    dawned on Koay, and that it was reasonable for Koay to believe that his task in
                    Singapore was merely to collect money for AJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Admissions by Koay in his long statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Altogether Koay gave five long statements in
                    which he made the following critical admissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     Koay admitted in his first long
                        statement (P40) that he was approached by AJ in February 2008 to deliver
                        heroin in Singapore and that he (Koay) asked Lim to assist him as the driver
                        to effect the delivery. Koay further said that he told Lim that his
                        assistance was required specifically to deliver heroin in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     Koay
                        admitted in his fifth long statement (P46) that he made several previous
                        deliveries of heroin in Singapore together with Lim on 3 March, 6, 8 15, and
                        26 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     As regards the drugs that were seized from the car on 28 May
                        2008, Koay admitted in P46 that he knew that he was delivering heroin to
                        different customers in Singapore on AJ’s instructions according to the
                        different labels on the bundles.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     Koay further admitted in his fourth long statement (P50)
                        that on 28 May 2008, he had collected the heroin from an “old
                        man” at the Holiday Plaza in Johor Bahru on AJ’s instructions
                        for delivery in Singapore. Koay recognised the “old man” as
                        the same person from whom he had collected heroin on previous occasions for
                        delivery in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_e"></a>(e)     Koay also admitted in P50 that after collecting the
                        heroin from the “old man”, he placed them inside the
                        compartment in the car’s loudspeaker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Although Koay claimed in P40 that he had
                    informed Lim that the “things” which they were instructed to
                    deliver in Singapore were heroin, the Prosecution clarified during Closing
                    Submissions that it was not relying on Koay’s admission against
                    Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Poor understanding of language</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Mr Nathan submitted that little weight
                    should be given to Koay’s incriminatory statements because most of the
                    long statements were recorded in interviews where questions in English were
                    translated to Koay in Mandarin, a language that Koay claimed, at the trial, he
                    was not completely comfortable with. Mr Nathan attached significance to the
                    fact that when SSI Sea recorded a statement from Koay (P35), Koay said that he
                    wished to speak in Hokkien and that the statement was in fact recorded in a
                    mixture of Hokkien and Cantonese.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     As the interviews of Koay by ASP Richard Soh
                    on 29 May 2008 (P38), 30 May 2008 (P41) and 3 June 2008 (P47), as
                    well as by ASP Gary Chan on 2 June 2008 (P50), were all conducted, via
                    interpreters, in Mandarin, Mr Nathan submitted that Koay was not able to
                    properly appreciate the questions posed to him, and his answers should therefore
                    not be seen as representative of his knowledge at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     However, the issue is not whether Koay was
                    more comfortable with Mandarin, Hokkien or Cantonese. Instead, the inquiry is
                    whether Koay’s long statements should be discounted given that the
                    interviews were conducted in Mandarin through interpreters. In order for me to
                    disregard the long statements, I must be satisfied that Koay did not fully
                    understand the questions posed by ASP Richard Soh or ASP Gary Chan during
                    the interviews, or the answers which he gave through the interpreters. The mere
                    fact that Koay preferred Hokkien to Mandarin does not necessarily lead to the
                    conclusion that the contents of his long statements may therefore not be
                    reliable. It is not unusual for a person to be sufficiently conversant in more
                    than one language or dialect. I pause to highlight that Koay’s challenge
                    to the long statements was selective. Not surprisingly he only challenged those
                    paragraphs that were adverse to his interests. If, as he claimed, he was not
                    proficient or comfortable with Mandarin, his challenge should be directed at the
                    long statements in their entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     From the evidence adduced at the trial, I am satisfied that Koay was able to understand the interview process even though the interviews were conducted in Mandarin, for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_a"></a>(a)     In P40 (Koay’s first long statement), he confirmed to ASP Gary Chan that he was able to understand and speak Mandarin, Hokkien, Cantonese and Malay.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_b"></a>(b)     At the commencement of each of the subsequent long statements (P41, P42, P43 and P46) Koay confirmed to ASP Richard Soh that he chose to speak in Mandarin which was interpreted in English by Mr Wu.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_c"></a>(c)     When Koay was separately interviewed by ASP Gary Chan, he again stated his wish to record his long statement (P50) in Mandarin.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_d"></a>(d)     During his testimony in court, Koay initially elected to give his evidence in the Cantonese dialect. I specifically took note that on at least two occasions, Koay explained his evidence to the Cantonese interpreter by writing the words to be translated in Mandarin. Clearly, Koay was sufficiently conversant in Mandarin for him to have explained his evidence to the interpreter in Mandarin. I should add for completeness that Koay elected to testify in Hokkien on his second day on the witness stand. The mere fact that Koay subsequently felt more comfortable to testify in Hokkien instead of Cantonese does not mean that his earlier answers in Cantonese were unreliable. In fact, during the Closing Oral Submissions, Mr Nathan accepted that there is evidence before the court that Koay understands some Mandarin and consequently it is not his case that he did not understand the interviews.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_e"></a>(e)     I accept the evidence of ASP Richard Soh and ASP Gary Chan that Koay provided his answers in Mandarin during their recording of his long statements. This was corroborated by the interpreter, Mr Wong, when ASP Gary Chan recorded P50 from Koay. Mr Wong testified that Koay used Mandarin during the interview though he accepted that Koay could have used a few dialect phrases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Koay’s state of mind</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Mr Nathan further submitted that
                    Koay’s admissions in his long statements should carry little weight as he
                    was suffering from the effects of having consumed sleeping pills which contained
                    benzodiazepines, <em>viz</em> feeling dazed and groggy, and
                    as a result his speech was not fully coherent. Koay claimed that he took mild
                    sleeping pills at about 4.00pm on 28 May 2008. This was compounded,
                    Mr Nathan argued, by the fact that Koay had not been able to sleep for 2
                    nights prior to the recording of the long statements. Consequently,
                    Mr Nathan submitted, Koay’s oral testimony in court – that he
                    was in Singapore to collect money for AJ, and received new instructions only
                    after crossing the Woodlands Checkpoint – should be preferred to his long
                    statements. Mr Nathan also relied on the fact that in the initial police
                    report filed by SSSgt Ng (P34), Koay and Lim were suspected of having consumed
                    controlled drugs. It was submitted that there must have been something in
                    Koay’s demeanour or appearance to cause SSSgt Ng to classify the offence
                    as one of consumption. This point was only raised by Koay although it is
                    apparent from the police report (P34) that both Lim and Koay were initially
                    suspected of consuming controlled drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Koay called Ms Moey Hooi Yan (DW3) from
                    the HSA to testify on his behalf. Ms Moey confirmed that although
                    Koay’s urine sample initially tested positive for benzodiazepines under
                    the IUT conducted on 28 May 2008, the subsequent confirmatory tests
                    conducted on 29 May 2008 found that Koay’s two urine samples were
                    negative for all controlled drugs including benzodiazepines. Ms Moey
                    explained that the IUT could have provided a false positive result.
                    Ms Moey’s evidence therefore effectively eliminated any scientific
                    basis for Koay’s alleged dazed state of mind at the time when the long
                    statements were recorded. In any event, by Koay’s own evidence, the
                    sleeping pills that he allegedly took on 28 May 2008 had a negative effect
                    (if at all) on him for at best six hours. However his long statements were
                    recorded over five days from 30 May to 3 June 2008. Koay, despite his
                    claim that he was not in the proper state of mind, was nonetheless able to make
                    pointed amendments to paras 4 and 6 of P40 when it was read back to him before
                    he signed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Koay was referred to Dr Ebreo Eleazar
                    Sarmiento (PW22) for pre-statement examination on 29 May 2008 at about
                    2.03am. Dr Sarmiento testified that Koay appeared clinically well and alert
                    to him. His evidence was not seriously challenged by Koay in
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In the final analysis, there is simply no
                    scientific or medical evidence that Koay was suffering from the effects of the
                    sleeping pills that he allegedly took on 28 May 2008 when the long
                    statements were recorded from him. The mere fact that the offence was initially
                    incorrectly classified as one of consumption of controlled drugs does not, in my
                    view, prove that Koay was not in a proper state of mind to understand the
                    interview process which resulted in the five long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the circumstances, given that Koay has
                    not satisfied me that the admissions contained in his long statements should not
                    be given weight and in the absence of any objective evidence to contradict his
                    admissions, I find that the Prosecution has proven that Koay knew prior to
                    entering Singapore that the bundles found in the loudspeaker in the car
                    contained diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Possession for the purpose of trafficking</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Having found that Lim and Koay were in
                    possession of not less than 120.96 grams of diamorphine for the purposes of
                    s 5(2) of the Act, the next issue for determination is whether the
                    Prosecution has proven that the diamorphine was in Lim’s and Koay’s
                    possession for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In this regard, Lim’s and Koay’s
                    defence ultimately hinged on their ability to challenge their respective long
                    statements. Once the challenge failed, the long statements proved beyond a
                    reasonable doubt that both Lim and Koay not only knew that the bundles concealed
                    in the loudpseaker of the car contained diamorphine, but also that they were
                    intended for delivery to various customers in Singapore. This much is clear from
                    the admissions set out in <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a> and <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above. Further, in P43, Koay admitted that he
                    had handed over one bundle labelled “B” to one Peter, <em>ie</em> Goh, at the Shell petrol kiosk. This was consistent
                    with the entry in Koay’s notebook (P118) ?
                    “Bukit Tiga 1, B”. It was accepted by Koay that the reference to
                    “Bukit Tiga” should read “Bukit Timah” instead. It
                    was no coincidence that the bundle labelled “B” was delivered to
                    Goh at the Shell petrol kiosk along Bukit Timah Road. Further, Lim also admitted
                    that at the time of the arrest, they were on their way to Jalan Sultan to make
                    another delivery. Once again, this was corroborated by Koay’s notebook
                    (P118) with the entry – “Jalan Sutan 1A”. It was not
                    disputed by Koay that his reference to “Jalan Sutan” meant
                    “Jalan Sultan”. In my view, their admissions in their respective
                    long statements together with Koay’s notebook proved beyond a reasonable
                    doubt that Lim and Koay were in Singapore to make deliveries of the bundles of
                    diamorphine found in the car, and that they were consequently jointly in
                    possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Prosecution also relied on the statutory
                    presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the Act, and submitted that it
                    remained unrebutted by Lim and Koay. In any event, no attempt was made by Lim or
                    Koay to rebut the presumption other than their unsuccessful challenge of their
                    long statements. As such, I find that the presumption in s 17 of the Act
                    remains unrebutted by Lim and Koay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    By reason of my findings, I am satisfied
                    that the Prosecution has proven the ingredients of the Charge against both Lim
                    and Koay beyond a reasonable doubt. In the premises, I find Lim and Koay guilty
                    of the Charge and hereby convict them under s 5(1) read with s 5(2) of
                    the Act. The mandatory death sentence prescribed under s 33 read with the
                    Second Schedule of the Act is pronounced accordingly.</p>
