</div> and the payments that were made by the Club pursuant to this resolution. The resolution, which the parties refer to as “the Indemnity Resolution”, states that members of the Club would assume liability arising from any legal action brought against members of the management committee as a result of their discharge of duties and responsibilities to the Club. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Indemnity Resolution was passed shortly after the respondent, Mr Freddie Koh Sin Chong (“the Respondent”), who was the former president of the Club, was sued by four members of the immediately preceding management committee (“the Four Members”) for making two defamatory statements against them. Pursuant to the resolution, the Club bore the legal costs of defending the defamation claim (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Suit No 33 of 2009 (“Suit 33”)) brought by the Four Members against the Respondent. The Club continued paying the legal costs incurred in relation to Suit 33 until a few months after this court found on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng </span><span class="font-italic">Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal </span>[2012] 1 SLR 506 (“the CA Defamation Judgment”) in November 2011 that the Respondent had made the two defamatory statements with malice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Respondent thereafter brought a claim against the Club for the legal costs that he had paid personally after the Club refused to indemnify him in accordance with the Indemnity Resolution. The Club, in response, brought a counterclaim against him seeking the refund of the monies that it had paid as legal costs for Suit 33. The Club argued that the Indemnity Resolution was invalid, or in the alternative that even if it was valid, the monies had been paid under the Club’s mistaken belief that the Respondent had acted in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities to the Club when he made the two defamatory statements. Both the claim and counterclaim were dismissed by the trial judge (“the Judge”). The Club appealed the Judge’s decision to dismiss its counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defamatory statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The two defamatory statements were made by the Respondent at the Club’s management committee meetings on 29 October and 26 November 2008, and were recorded in the minutes of the meetings which were published on the Club’s notice board. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The two defamatory statements pertained to the decision of the 2007/2008 management committee (“the 2007 MC”) to purchase a new water system for the Club’s facilities, including its swimming pools and Jacuzzis. As the expenditure for the purchase of this system was an unbudgeted item, the 2007 MC had to either call for an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) to request a supplementary budget or approve the expenditure on the basis of it being an “emergency” and subsequently seek ratification of the expenditure at the next annual general meeting (“AGM”). The 2007 MC decided to adopt the latter course and sought to obtain ratification of the expenditure at the Club’s next AGM on 25 May 2008 (“the 2008 AGM”). At the 2008 AGM, the matter turned out to be highly contentious. Instead of ratifying the expenditure, the members of the Club adopted a motion, which was supported by 210 members, for the establishment of a Special Ad Hoc Audit Committee (“the Audit Committee”) consisting of four of the Club’s members to review the expenditure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 8 August 2008, the Audit Committee returned with a report that concluded that there was no breach of the Club’s procedures as the expenditure was of an emergency nature. Shortly after, however, the treasurer of the Club, Mr Tan Wee Tin (“WT Tan”), discovered several documents that had not been disclosed to the Audit Committee, which contained information that was inconsistent with the representations made by the 2007 MC at the 2008 AGM. The 2008/2009 management committee (“2008 MC”) asked the Audit Committee to consider these new documents, and tasked WT Tan to investigate further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The first defamatory statement was made by the Respondent at a management committee meeting on 29 October 2008. After WT Tan had reported his findings to the committee, the Respondent, who had earlier been elected as president of the Club at the 2008 AGM, remarked that the 2008 MC should correct a “misrepresentation of the facts made by the [2007 MC] to influence the ratification of the expenditure at [the 2008 AGM]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At the second management committee meeting held on 26 November 2008, the Respondent made the second defamatory statement consisting of several allegations against the 2007 MC, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “[i]t could be a case of misrepresentation of facts to [the 2008 AGM] to get ratification for a capital expenditure of a water system that could not be justified under the urgent [or] emergency reason”. As stated at [4] above, the minutes of both meetings were posted on the Club’s notice board in accordance with its practice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 22 December 2008, the Four Members, through their solicitors, issued a letter of demand to the Respondent alleging that the Respondent had falsely and maliciously defamed them.

The court found at [96] that the Respondent’s dominant motive for publishing the defamatory statements was to injure the Four Members, whether out of personal spite or as follow-up actions after having made the ratification of the expenditure an election issue during the 2008 AGM. The court found that there was overwhelming evidence that the Respondent had gone on a “witch-hunt” and was determined to soil the reputation of the Four Members in the eyes of the members of the Club.

The six members also considered D&amp;N’s request for them to provide confirmation that the Club would continue to indemnify the Respondent’s legal expenses if the Club wanted Mr Nair to act for the Respondent in another suit that had just been commenced. The six members did not think there was a need to provide a further confirmation and noted that “the ability of the Club to provide such an indemnity to its officials ... had been upheld by the High Court when a member challenged it [in OS 469]”.

The Judge held that the Club was entitled to change its mind at any time, as it had in the present case. He further held that the Respondent could not rely on the doctrine of estoppel to enforce his alleged right to be reimbursed for payments, as that would amount to an impermissible use of the doctrine as a sword, in the sense of a free-standing cause of action. The Respondent did not appeal the Judge’s decision to dismiss his claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Club sought to argue for the purposes of its counterclaim that the Indemnity Resolution was void because it had been passed under a fundamental mistake. It took the position that the 2008 MC, by the deliberate design of the Respondent, was not made aware of the contents of the Members’ Letter and the fact that Suit 33 was not covered under the Club’s insurance policy when it passed the Indemnity Resolution at the 14 January MC meeting. In the alternative, the Club argued that the resolution was voidable (i) because it had been procured through the Respondent’s “sharp practice” and acts of deceit; or (ii) due to the various breaches of fiduciary duties on the part of the Respondent and some members of the 2008 MC. The Club asserted that it had elected to rescind the resolution when the members passed the EGM Resolutions (see [41] above). Lastly, the Club submitted that even if the Indemnity Resolution was valid, it was only intended to cover instances where office bearers were acting in the proper discharge of their duties. It argued that the Club had made the payments under the mistake that the Respondent had acted in the discharge of his duty when he made the two defamatory statements, and was thus entitled to restitution of the sums that had been paid under the law of unjust enrichment.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Judge was not persuaded by the Club’s submissions. He held that there was no basis to find that the Indemnity Resolution was void or voidable on the ground of a fundamental mistake or unconscionability on the part of the Respondent because the 2008 MC would have passed the resolution even if it had been privy to the two pieces of information. As for the second issue of whether the Indemnity Resolution was voidable for breach of fiduciary duties, the Judge held that the Club had not discharged its burden of proving that the 2008 MC had passed the Indemnity Resolution in self-interest or in the Respondent’s interest. Crucially, seven of the 12 members of the 2008 MC were not called as witnesses. Without their evidence, the Judge was in no position to decide what their motivations were in passing the Indemnity Resolution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Judge was, however, of the view that the 2008 MC acted in a position of <span class="font-italic">potential</span> conflict of interest in passing the resolution, because each member stood to benefit from it. But he held that it did not follow that the Indemnity Resolution was voidable at the Club’s instance, as the resolution had been impliedly affirmed by the Club through its inaction over the intervening years. In any case, the Judge noted that the Club did not attempt to revoke the Indemnity Resolution even at the 4 March EGM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Judge also rejected the Club’s contention that the Respondent had procured payment of his legal costs in breach of his fiduciary duties to the Club. He found that the Respondent neither had <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>nor <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>control over the decision to pay his legal costs, and thus could not be said to have procured the payment of his legal costs. In addition, the Judge held that the Club had failed to show that the Respondent did not honestly believe that he was entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution, which would have been necessary to establish the Respondent’s breach of fiduciary duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Judge also dismissed the Club’s claim in unjust enrichment, as he took the view that the Indemnity Resolution covered the Respondent’s legal costs and damages in the defamation action. The Judge noted that the Indemnity Resolution was precipitated by Suit 33, and he concluded from the evidence that the 2008 MC had not intended the Respondent’s entitlement to an indemnity to be in any way contingent upon the outcome of Suit 33. Rather, it appeared to the Judge that the 2008 MC had intended the phrase “discharge of their duties” in the Indemnity Resolution to bear a broad meaning with the distinction drawn between acts done in personal capacity and acts done in capacity as management committee members. As the defamatory statements were made by the Respondent in his capacity as president of the Club, the Judge found that those acts would have fallen within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution, and concluded that the payments of the Respondent’s legal costs were not made under a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision to dismiss its counterclaim, the Club has appealed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Club’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Club’s arguments on appeal would appear to be largely similar to those it advanced before the Judge. Its primary argument on appeal is founded in unjust enrichment. In the alternative, it argues, as before, that the Indemnity Resolution was void or voidable as result of the deception of the Respondent or his or the 2008 MC’s breaches of fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In respect of its primary claim in unjust enrichment, the Club argues that the Indemnity Resolution did not cover the legal costs incurred in Suit 33 and the Suits 33 Appeals because the Respondent had acted with malice and was thus not acting in proper discharge of his duty in making the defamatory statements.

The Respondent also argues that the Club’s case that the Indemnity Resolution is invalid had not been pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Leaving the preliminary objections aside, the Respondent’s case centres on the following arguments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that the Club’s reliance on the finding of malice in the CA Defamation Judgment is misplaced because (i) the 2008 MC had intended for the Indemnity Resolution to cover the legal costs of Suit 33 regardless of the outcome of the suit; and (ii) the 2008 MC and the 2011 MC were entitled to hold to their belief that the Respondent had not acted in malice despite the Court of Appeal finding to the contrary.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that the Club had not proven that the Indemnity Resolution was procured by “sharp practice” or passed under a mistake and should thus be void or voidable. In this regard, the Respondent points out that the Indemnity Resolution remains in existence and has not been revoked by the Club. He also asserts that the resolution is valid even though the 2008 MC was in a position of conflict of interest when it passed the resolution because it had been subsequently reaffirmed by the Club.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, contrary to what the Club alleges, he had not breached his fiduciary duties to the Club. In particular, the Respondent points out that he did not procure the payments and that the payments had been effected through proper channels and clearance processes.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, he argues that even if the Club’s case was accepted by the court, he should still be entitled to rely on the defences of estoppel and change in position, which would bar the Club from asking for the return all the sums that had been paid towards Suit 33 and its related matters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appeal hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 At the hearing before us, counsel for the Club, Mr Tan Chee Meng SC (“Mr Tan”), focused his oral submissions almost exclusively on the claim in unjust enrichment and the argument that the Club had made the payments under the mistaken belief that the Respondent’s conduct fell within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution. When queried, Mr Tan also agreed that the crux of his case was on the construction of the Indemnity Resolution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We find it significant that Mr Tan did not raise the argument that the Indemnity Resolution was void or voidable at any point during the hearing. In fact, the arguments made by Mr Tan during the hearing presume that the Indemnity Resolution is valid. However, we do not take this to mean that the Club is no longer challenging the validity of the Indemnity Resolution, especially given that this issue had formed the bulk of its written submissions. As we indicated in response to counsel for the Respondent, Mr Paul Seah (“Mr Seah”), when he pointed out that this issue had been conspicuously omitted from Mr Tan’s address, we recognised that the hearing had developed in the manner it did partially because of the line of questioning from the Bench. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues before us </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The following two issues lie at the core of the parties’ dispute: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable, and thus invalid; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the Club had made the payments to the Respondent under a mistake of fact and is thus entitled to claim repayment of the same from the Respondent on the ground of unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Additionally, the Club is seeking to rely on a third cause of action premised on the Respondent’s alleged breach of fiduciary duties to the Club in procuring the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments, even though it has not argued this in a consistent and satisfactory manner. In its submissions in the court below and in its Appellant’s Case, the Club appears to be relying on this not as a standalone cause of action, but as a ground to support its overarching argument that the Indemnity Resolution is voidable and invalid. Despite this, we consider that it is sufficiently clear from its pleadings (see [133] below) and from Mr Tan’s submissions at the hearing before us that the Club is relying on the Respondent’s alleged breach of fiduciary duties as a separate cause of action to claim the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments. We will address this issue at [132] below after discussing the first two issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Indemnity Resolution is valid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 By way of recapitulation, the Club contends that the Indemnity Resolution is void <span class="font-italic">ab</span><span class="font-italic"> initio </span>or voidable in equity because it had been passed under a mistake arising from the Respondent’s deceptive and unconscionable conduct. It argues that the Respondent and some of the 2008 MC members, who were in cahoots with the Respondent, had concealed the following two pieces of vital information from the 2008 MC at the 14 January MC Meeting when the Indemnity Resolution was passed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the fact that the Respondent’s defence in Suit 33 fell under the “Insured v Insured Exclusion” of the Club’s insurance policy and would thus not be covered (see [13] above)</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Members’ Letters, in which the views of ten members of the Club who disapproved of the use the Club’s funds to finance the defence of Suit 33 were set out (see [15] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It further contends that the Indemnity Resolution is voidable in equity by virtue of the breaches of fiduciary duty of the Respondent and the members of the 2008 MC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue was not pleaded by the Club </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As pointed out by the Judge, the issue of the validity of the Indemnity Resolution had not been properly pleaded by the Club in its defence and counterclaim. The Club had only pleaded that (i) it had made the payments under a mistake; and (ii) that the Respondent had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties in respect of the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments. Although the Club had set out some of the allegations at paragraphs 19 to 23 of the defence and counterclaim, the pleadings did not sufficiently disclose that the Club was going to assert that the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable because of these reasons. Neither was there a prayer in the pleadings for a declaration that the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable, whether for mistake, unconscionability or for breach of fiduciary duty. In these circumstances, we agree with the Respondent’s submission that the Club cannot attempt to circumvent the rules of pleading by arguing that the validity of the Indemnity Resolution was always “a live issue” between the parties.

In our view, the Judge had correctly concluded from the evidence that the 2008 MC would have passed the Indemnity Resolution even if the two pieces of information had been made known at the 14 January MC Meeting (at [132]–[144] of the GD). Although it is unclear if all the members of the 2008 MC knew about the “Insured v Insured Exclusion”, it can be gathered from the discussion recorded in the meeting transcripts that it was within the 2008 MC’s contemplation and intention that the Indemnity Resolution is to cover the members of the management committee even where the acts in question were not covered by the insurance policy. This can be seen, in particular, from the following exchange that was recorded in the transcripts of the meeting:

That’s what I’m saying. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The discussion that the members of the 2008 MC had at the 14 January MC Meeting showed that the management committee members held the view that the Club had an overarching policy of protecting its management committee members by an indemnity from the Club for acts done in the discharge of their duties to the Club, and that this commitment to indemnify the members of the management committee extended beyond the scope of the insurance policy that the Club had purchased for the members of the management committee. The logical conclusion from this is that the 2008 MC would have passed the Indemnity Resolution <span class="font-italic">even if </span>they were informed that Suit 33 was not covered by the insurance policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Similarly, we are inclined towards the view that the 2008 MC would still have passed the Indemnity Resolution even if they had known about the Members’ Letter. As noted by the Judge at [137]–[143] of the GD, the members of the 2008 MC must have known about the Members’ Letter by 17 February 2009, when one of its members, Gary Oon, brought up the letter when he was objecting to the insurance coverage and the Indemnity Resolution covering defamation actions, including Suit 33. The fact that none of the members of the 2008 MC, even after they knew about the contents of the Members’ Letter, raised any point that he or she had been misled into approving the Indemnity Resolution or sought to rescind or amend the resolution demonstrates that the letter and its contents had little, if any, bearing on their decision-making process in respect of the Indemnity Resolution and its scope.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for the Club’s argument that the Respondent’s unconscionable conduct would make the Indemnity Resolution void, we agree with the Judge’s finding (at [130] and [145]–[154] of the GD) that the Club had not adduced sufficient evidence to prove that the Respondent had deliberately concealed the two pieces of information from the 2008 MC in order to mislead them into passing the resolution.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Indemnity Resolution is voidable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In our judgment, the Club’s argument that the Indemnity Resolution is invalid because it is voidable also lacks merit. Even if we accept the Club’s case that the Indemnity Resolution is voidable for the reasons it puts forward, the fact that it remains in existence necessarily means that it has not been set aside by the Club. This would in turn mean that it is still valid. The EGM Resolutions that were passed at the 4 March EGM were to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, (i) stop further payments being made to indemnify the Respondent’s expenses in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals; and (ii) reclaim the sums that had been paid out in relation to the same (see [41] and [51] above). No action has been taken by the Club – either at the EGM or in the three intervening years leading up to the present appeal – to revoke the Indemnity Resolution or to propose a change in the Club’s policy to indemnify members of the management committee of legal expenses incurred in the discharge of their duty and responsibility to the Club. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Further, the evidence shows that the Indemnity Resolution has been re-affirmed by the inaction of the members of the Club from the time it was passed at the 14 January MC Meeting. Five foregone opportunities which the members of the Club could have revoked the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Indemnity Resolution, if they had wished to do so, </span>had been listed by the Judge <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [175] of the GD):</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) when the Indemnity Resolution was first published to the members on the notice board (see [18] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) when PC Poh filed OS 469 to challenge the validity of the Indemnity Resolution (see [19] above); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) when the Indemnity Resolution and OS 469 were discussed during the 2009 AGM (see [22] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) when the payments made pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution towards the Respondent’s legal costs in Suit 33 were presented to the members for approval at the 2010 AGM, during which the issue was discussed at length (see [27] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) when further payments made pursuant to the Indemnity Resolution towards the Respondent’s legal costs in Suit 33 were presented to the members for approval at the 2011 AGM (see [33] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As discussed at [82] above, the members had a further opportunity to rescind the Indemnity Resolution at the 4 March EGM but did not do so. In these circumstances, we agree with the Judge’s finding (at [179]–[180] of the GD) that it must be taken that the members had impliedly affirmed the Indemnity Resolution. In fact, we would go even further to say that the members’ conduct amounted to acquiescence and an endorsement of the Indemnity Resolution, or more specifically, of the Club’s decision to indemnify the Respondent in Suit 33. Therefore, even if we accept the Club’s submission that the Indemnity Resolution may have been voidable at the time of its passing because of the various reasons that have been put forward (in particular, because the 2008 MC had been in a position of a potential conflict of interest when they passed the resolution which benefitted them), the members had reaffirmed and adopted the resolution thereafter with their acquiescence and conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Concluding observations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 We make two concluding observations on this issue. First, it bears highlighting that the Indemnity Resolution is worded in broad terms and is not meant to apply only to Suit 33. In fact, the Indemnity Resolution does not even explicitly refer to Suit 33. Even though D&amp;N’s request for the Club’s assurance that it would indemnify the Respondent for his legal costs in Suit 33 (see [14] above) was the catalyst for the passing of the resolution, the evidence suggests that the passing of the Indemnity Resolution was no more than a formal process to set out what was already a clear policy of the Club. This weakens the Club’s arguments that the Indemnity Resolution, in its entirety, should be void or voidable because of the Respondent’s conduct. In this regard, we observe that many of the Club’s arguments in respect of the validity of the Indemnity Resolution are targeted at portraying that the Club had been unconscionably misled and influenced by the Respondent to pay for his legal costs of Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. Such arguments may assist the Club in its alternative cases that the payments had been made by it (i) under a mistaken belief that it fell within the scope of the Club’s policy, which is encapsulated in the Indemnity Resolution, or (ii) as a result of the Respondent’s breaches of fiduciary duty to the Club. But, in our judgment, it does little to support the Club’s case that the Indemnity Resolution is void or voidable. Unfortunately, the Club’s submissions have, more often than not, failed to make a distinction between:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Indemnity Resolution <span class="font-italic">per se</span> and the specific decision to indemnify the Respondent in respect of Suit 33; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  the Indemnity Resolution <span class="font-italic">per se </span>and the payments that were subsequently made in respect of Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals pursuant to the resolution.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, there may be a fundamental problem with the Club’s submission on this issue which has not been raised by either party. The Club relies on principles or concepts that apply to contracts in arguing that the resolution is void or voidable. It is well-established that a contract may be void if it was made under a fundamental mistake, or may be voidable in equity for other reasons (<span class="font-italic">per Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 502). The Club’s arguments presuppose either that a resolution is a contract, or that contractual principles should apply in the same manner to resolutions. The first assumption is clearly wrong. As the Judge had rightly pointed out (at [74]–[75] of the GD), resolutions are not contracts and have no legal effect in and of themselves. The Indemnity Resolution records the formal decision of the Club, or more specifically the decision reached by its management committee. It is not a contract between the Club and its members or any third party. In these circumstances, it is not immediately clear to us whether, and why, contractual principles should be transplanted and applied to resolutions. We would, however, say no more on this issue given that it had not been raised by either party and given that, in any event, the claim would fail even if we assume that the legal principles that have been raised are sound. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 We turn now to address the Club’s claim in unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Respondent had been unjustly enriched </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Before we set out the applicable legal principles and discuss the claim proper, we have a brief comment to make on the manner in which the Club has argued this claim on appeal. In its pleadings and submissions in the court below, the Club had quite clearly framed a significant part of its case as an unjust enrichment claim. However, the same cannot be said for its submissions on this issue on appeal. It is unclear from the relevant sections in its Appellant’s Case and skeletal submissions whether the Club is still relying on a cause of action in unjust enrichment. The way the Club has put forward this argument on appeal prompts the Respondent to comment in his Respondent’s Case that the Club “appears to have abandoned its argument at trial based on unjust enrichment on the ground of mistake”. The words “unjust enrichment” or “unjustly enriched” do not appear in the Club’s submissions on appeal (save for Mr Tan’s oral submissions when he was asked by the court about the cause of action that he was seeking to rely on). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Leaving the issue of semantics aside, the point we are making is that the Club should have focused its arguments within the framework of an unjust enrichment claim, particularly on whether the Club had made the payments under a mistake, instead of focusing on proving that the Respondent’s conduct fell outside the scope of the Indemnity Resolution without linking this back to the mistake that was allegedly operating on the Club’s mind. As much as we recognise that the issue of whether the Respondent’s conduct fell outside the scope of the resolution is relevant to the question of whether the payments had been made under a mistake and may even be seen as the flip side of the same coin in the context of this case, the fact remains that the connection between the two must be set out. Although this is not fatal to the Club’s case because it is sufficiently clear from the entirety of its arguments in the court below and on appeal that it is pursuing a claim in unjust enrichment, its case could have been clearer and its arguments more targeted if the correct framework had not been lost sight of.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on unjust enrichment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To make out a cause of action in unjust enrichment, a claimant must demonstrate the following elements (<span class="font-italic">per</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”)):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that a benefit has been received or an enrichment has accrued to the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the benefit or enrichment is at the claimant’s expense; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the defendant’s enrichment is “unjust”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If these three elements are satisfied, the further question to consider is whether there are any defences to the claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The dispute in the present appeal lies in whether the third element (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the defendant’s enrichment is “unjust”) is satisfied and, if so, whether there are any defences that the Respondent can rely on. It is undisputed that the first and second elements are satisfied in that the Club had benefitted the Respondent by paying on his behalf from its funds the legal costs and expenses which he had incurred in Suit 33 and the Suit 33 Appeals. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As this court sought to emphasise in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>(at [130]), unjust enrichment is not based on a general or broad notion of unconscionability or unjustness. Unjust enrichment focuses on the claimant’s loss or deprivation, and not on the fault of the recipient. In contrast with the approach of civilian and other mixed systems of law, the common law approach has been that claimants in unjust enrichment must demonstrate a positive reason for restitution. The contrast between the two approaches was discussed by Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group </span><span class="font-italic">plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners </span>[2007] 1 AC 558 at [21], where he observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… unlike civilian systems, English law has no general principle that to retain money paid without any legal basis (such as debt, gift, compromise, etc) is unjust enrichment. In the Woolwich case [1993] AC 70, 172 Lord Goff said that English law might have developed so as to recognise such a general principle—the condictio indebiti of civilian law—but had not done so. In England, the claimant has to prove that the circumstances in which the payment was made come within one of the categories which the law recogni[s]es as sufficient to make retention by the recipient unjust. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The common law approach thus requires a claimant to identify specific ground(s) of restitution, which are legally recognised factors that make the defendant’s enrichment unjust and are thus often referred to as “unjust factors” (see Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell and Stephen Watterson, <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>”) at paras 1-21 and 1-22). The list of recognised “unjust factors” includes mistake, duress, undue influence, failure of basis, illegality <span class="font-italic">etc</span> (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 1-22). The categories of unjust enrichment are not closed, but the courts are generally cautious not to recognise new grounds of recovery too freely (see<span class="font-italic"> </span>Laws LJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Gibb v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust </span>[2010] EWCA Civ 678 at [26]–[27], and <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 1-23 and 1-24). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, the Club relies on mistake of fact, which is a well-established unjust factor. The principles governing the recovery of mistaken payments in the context of an unjust enrichment claim are summarised in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 9-31 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the claimant must prove, as a threshold matter, that he had made a mistake, in that he had believed that it was more likely than not that the true facts (or the true state of law where mistake of law is pleaded) were otherwise than they in fact were. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the claimant’s belief must have caused him to confer the benefit on the defendant. In other words, the mistake must be causative. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, even if a causative mistake can be shown, the claimant maybe denied relief if he had responded unreasonably to his doubts, and had thus unreasonably ran the risk of error. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, a claimant who had doubts may be denied relief on the distinct grounds that he has compromised or settled with the defendant, or on the basis that he is estopped from pleading the mistake.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Club had paid the sums under a mistake of fact </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Club argues that it had made the payments in respect of Suit 33 and related matters on behalf of the Respondent because it was under the mistaken belief that the Respondent had been sued as a result of the discharge of his duties and responsibilities for and on behalf of the Club. Putting it another way, the Club’s case is that it had paid the legal costs for the Respondent thinking that the circumstances of the case brought against him in Suit 33 fell within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution. Mr Tan submits that the Club only found out that it had been operating under a mistake when they realised from the CA Defamation Judgment that the Respondent had made those statements with malice and for his personal purposes, and thus could not have been acting in the interest of the Club or in the discharge of his duties to the Club.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In our view, the reaction of members of the Club to the CA Defamation Judgment strongly supports the Club’s case. Shortly after the release of the judgment, over 500 members of the Club acted to requisition an EGM in order to pass the EGM Resolutions (see [41] above). The EGM Resolutions were eventually passed at the 4 March EGM and thereafter, the Club ceased making payments and commenced proceedings to seek the return of the sums that had already been paid on behalf of the Respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The fact that the CA Defamation Judgment sparked off such a reaction within the Club indicates that the members had no prior knowledge of the true nature of the Respondent’s acts and that they would not have been willing to indemnify the Respondent if they had known that he had made those defamatory statements for his personal vendetta and not in the discharge of his duty towards the Club. This supports the Club’s case in two ways:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it supports the Club’s position that the payments had been made under the mistaken premise that the Respondent was properly discharging his duty to the Club when he made the defamatory statements, and that the Club only realised its mistake when the CA Defamation Judgment was released in November 2011. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, assuming that we accept that the Club had made a mistake in making the payments, this would go towards showing that the mistake was causative in nature, in that the Club would not have made the payments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the members would have voiced out their objections and exercised their voting rights to prevent the payments from being made) if it had known about the true nature of the Respondent’s acts. As set out at [94(b)] above, the Club has to show that the mistake was an operative and causative in order to succeed in its claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Additionally, the fact that these events within the Club had occurred while the Respondent and the 2011 MC (which was led by him) were still in office weakens the Respondent’s case theory that the Club’s claim against him was a “change [in] course” and was due to a “sea change” in the Club’s internal politics and management.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Respondent’s Case at paragraph 2. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The objective evidence shows instead that it was the members of the Club, and not the new management that had assumed office after the 2012 AGM held on 27 May 2012, that were pushing for the return of the payments and the cessation of further payments after the release of the CA Defamation Judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We turn next to examine the arguments raised by Mr Seah to refute the Club’s claim that it had made the payments under a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Seah’s first argument is that the 2008 MC, which had drafted and passed the resolution, had intended that the Respondent would be indemnified for any<span class="font-italic"> </span>costs and expenses he incurred in relation to Suit 33 regardless of the outcome of the suit. He submits that this had to be the case given that the 2008 MC had full and intimate knowledge of the facts leading to Suit 33, including the fact that the Four Members had alleged malice against the Respondent in the statement of claim for Suit 33. He thus argues that the Club had not made the payments under a mistake, as it had meant to indemnify the Respondent even if he was found, as he was, to have acted with malice and for his personal vendetta in making the defamatory statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Given that the Indemnity Resolution clearly states that the Club will indemnify its management committee members for legal costs that have been incurred “as a result of the [member] <span class="font-italic">discharging … his or her duties and responsibilities for and on behalf of the Club</span>” [emphasis added], we find it difficult to accept that the Respondent’s acts would fall within the scope of the resolution. At [96] of the CA Defamation Judgment, this court found that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the [Respondent’s] dominant motive for publishing the Statements was to injure the [Four Members], <span class="font-italic">whether out of personal spite or as follow-up actions after having made ratification of the expenditure an election issue during the 2008 AGM</span>. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence that the [Respondent] was determined, on the pretext that the expenditure was irregular, to soil the reputation of the [Four Members] in the eyes of the members of the Club. Therefore the defence of qualified privilege is not available to the [Respondent] on account of malice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In our judgment, an act that is motivated by malice and by one’s personal vendetta is inherently irreconcilable with an act done in <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>discharge of duty. We cannot see how the Respondent can be said to be acting for and on behalf of the Club when he was motivated by his own agenda and personal vendetta in publishing the defamatory statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Respondent tries to circumvent this conclusion by arguing that such an objective interpretation of the resolution should not be adopted because the Club (i) had intended to indemnify the Respondent regardless of the outcome in Suit 33 and (ii) had intended the phrase “discharging … [their] duties” to bear a broad meaning, in that it was only meant to distinguish between acts done in a personal capacity and acts done in the capacity of a member of the management committee. Both of these arguments were accepted by the Judge (at [220] and [224] of the GD respectively). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We are not persuaded by either submission. It is undisputed that the Club intended to indemnify the Respondent even if he eventually lost Suit 33. In fact, this had been contemplated and conveyed to members at the 2010 AGM by WT Tan (see [29] above). To this extent, the Respondent is correct to assert that the Club did not intend for the Respondent’s entitlement to the indemnity to be contingent on the <span class="font-italic">outcome</span> of Suit 33. But the evidence does not show that the Club intended to indemnify the Respondent regardless<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the <span class="font-italic">findings</span> of the court in Suit 33 such that they were willing to indemnify him even if the court finds, as it had, that he had not acted <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in the discharge of his duty to the Club. The contents of the requisition notice for the EGM that was tendered by the members to the Club on 18 January 2012 showed that what the members took issue with was not the fact that the Respondent had been found liable for defamation, but the specific finding of the court that the Respondent had been on a “witch hunt”, had “an agenda of his own” and “had acted with malice”. The members who signed the notice expressed the view that as the Respondent “had acted with malice, the defamatory statements made by him cannot be said to have been made in the discharge of his duty [or] responsibility as an office bearer”.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As for the Respondent’s argument that the Club had intended the phrase “discharging … their duties” to be defined in such a broad manner that it would include any act as long as it is done in the capacity as an officer of the Club, we are of the view that such a reading of the phrase is neither consistent with the natural and plain meaning of those words nor with reason and logic. It is also not supported by any evidence. Indeed, the reactions of the members of the Club, as we summarised at [96] above, militate against the Respondent’s arguments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Given the above, we are unable to accept the Respondent’s submission that the Indemnity Resolution is broad enough to cover the Respondent’s acts in relation to the defamatory statements even in the face of the finding of this court in the CA Defamation Judgment that there existed malice on the part of the Respondent when he uttered those defamatory statements.

text-justify">107 Mr Seah submits, in the alternative, that the management committees of the Club (specifically, the 2008 MC and the 2011 MC) were not bound by this court’s finding in the CA Defamation Judgment that the Respondent had acted with malice when he made the defamatory statements. He argues that the CA Defamation Judgment being a “judgment <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span>” was <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes </span>and was conclusive only as between the parties in that litigation. He submits that the Judge was correct to have found that the management committee was entitled, even after CA Defamation Judgment had been delivered, to take a different view from this court on the Respondent’s actions (at [227] of the GD). Although Mr Seah was careful to remain respectful and deferential towards the court, he is essentially submitting that the Court of Appeal’s finding that the defamatory statements had been made by the Respondent with malice may not have been correct given that the court was two steps removed from the events of the day whereas the 2008 MC had personal and first-hand knowledge of what was happening. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 We do not think that this submission has any real merit. Although the court’s finding in the CA Defamation Judgment was made nearly three years after the fact, the finding of the court is not prospective in nature. The court was not saying that this is the position henceforth. The finding is a finding of the state of the mind of the Respondent <span class="font-italic">at the time </span>he was making those defamatory remarks. The argument that the 2008 MC was a better judge of the Respondent’s motivations, as it was closer to the ground and thus more privy to the events surrounding the defamation is a non-starter. The fact remains that the finding of malice on the part of the Respondent by this court in the CA Defamation Judgment is conclusive and has legal effect regardless of what the 2008 MC thought or thinks. The litigants or other parties may disagree with what the court finds, but that cannot change the legal consequences and status of a finding by a court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 With respect, the Judge had erred in downplaying this court’s finding of malice. The Judge had expressed the following view at [230] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Instead, the Club premised its case on mistake almost entirely on the Court of Appeal’s finding of malice in Suit 33. Had the Court of Appeal not found that the defence of qualified privilege was defeated by the [Respondent’s] malice, the Club’s case on mistake would have no legs to stand on. In my view, it would be both artificial and contrary to principle to find that the Club had paid the [Respondent’s] legal costs under a mistake merely because the Court of Appeal had drawn its own inferences from the same set of facts known to the 2008 MC, and had attached the legal label of malice to the [Respondent’s] conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 We cannot agree that this court’s finding of malice on the part of the Respondent was a mere “legal label” or a legal fiction. On the contrary, the finding carries legal consequences and is binding on the parties. It is a definitive finding as to the state of mind of the Respondent when he made the defamatory remarks. In these circumstances, it is neither artificial nor contrary to principle to find that the Club had paid the Respondent’s legal costs under a mistake. If a finding by this court as to a fact is not determinative of that fact, we do not know what is. In a country governed by the rule of law, a finding of fact by this court must necessarily be the last word. Most importantly, the Club, and its general body, would not have known what the state of mind of the Respondent was when he made those defamatory utterances. The Club and its members in general would naturally have assumed that the Respondent did not have any malicious motive when he made those comments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Mr Seah’s second argument raises another issue even though he had not expressly argued it as such. Given that the 2008 MC had been closely involved in the events that led up to the making of the defamatory statements and Suit 33, there is a possibility that at least some of the members of the 2008 MC might have been aware of the Respondent’s state of mind when he was making the defamatory remarks. The court had made the following observations at [94] of the CA Defamation Judgment: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… notwithstanding that the Audit Committee charged by the 2008 AGM to look into the expenditure had exonerated the [2007 MC], the [Respondent] <span class="font-italic">and the rest of the [2008 MC] </span>were determined to embark on a “witch-hunt” against the [Four Members] by conducting their own investigations into the expenditure, and repeatedly beseeching the Audit Committee to amend the Audit Report, despite the Audit Committee’s repeated refusal to do so. … From this chain of correspondences, it is evident that the <span class="font-italic">[2008 MC]</span>, including the [Respondent], had, from the beginning, decided to indict the [Four Members] of wrongdoing, and was determined to proceed to do so themselves when they failed to persuade the Audit Committee to their position. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 These observations made by the court in the Suit 33 Appeals allude to the possibility that the 2008 MC, or at least some members in the said committee, might have known of the true nature of the Respondent’s acts. This in turn raises the question as to whether the Club can still be said to be labouring under a mistake if some of its members, or more specifically members of its management committee, had such knowledge at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 However, what is significant is that no one at the meetings of the management committee or of the general body had raised the point that the Respondent would still be covered by the indemnity even if the court was to find not only that the statements were defamatory but that they were made with malice. We have no doubt that if anyone were to have raised this very query at a meeting, the general response would have been “of course not”. It is simply unthinkable that any responsible member of the management committee, or of the Club, would have said yes. It is probably true to assume that many in the management committee would not have thought when they approved the Indemnity Resolution that the Respondent had a personal agenda against the Four Members. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that Gary Oon, who was part of the 2008 MC, had reservations about the Club indemnifying the Respondent in relation to Suit 33 (see [24] above) on the basis that defamation was a tortious act, what more if the Respondent had uttered those statements with malice and for personal motives.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Having said that, the possibility that some of the members of the 2008 MC, who were actively on the “witch-hunt” with the Respondent to indict the plaintiffs in Suit 33, might have had knowledge of the Respondent’s motives and state of mind in making the statements cannot be discounted. However, in our judgment, the breach of duty exception will operate to prevent the knowledge of such members to taint the state of mind of the Club. There is nothing to indicate that the general body knew of the surrounding circumstances leading to the making of the defamatory statements by the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The breach of duty exception is commonly referred to as the “<span class="font-italic">Re Hampshire Land </span>principle”, as it is often associated with the case of <span class="font-italic">In re Hampshire Land</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>even though there is some controversy as to whether the application of this principle was the true ground of the decision<span class="font-italic">. </span>The principle was recently discussed and clarified by the United Kingdom Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) and others v Nazir and others (No 2) </span>[2015] 2 WLR 1168 (“<span class="font-italic">Bilta</span>”) and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in the case of <span class="font-italic">Moulin Global </span><span class="font-italic">Eyecare Trading Ltd (In Liq) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue </span>[2014] 3 HKC 323 (“<span class="font-italic">Moulin</span>”). The principle was also discussed at some length in the High Court case of <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Lippo Marina Collection Ltd and others </span>[2016] 2 SLR 597 at [47]–[55]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In essence, the breach of duty exception applies in certain circumstances to prevent the attribution of an agent’s knowledge of his breach of duty or acts to the principal even though in other contexts or circumstances, the agent’s state of mind and acts would be attributable to the principal. This exception, which is motivated by reasons of public policy, only applies as against the agent who is in breach of his duty to the principal, or a third party who is complicit in the breach. It has no application as against an innocent third party (see <span class="font-italic">Moulin </span>at [131], <span class="font-italic">Bilta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In our judgment, the breach of duty exception would apply in the present case. A member of the 2008 MC – if any at all, apart from the Respondent – who had knowledge about the true nature of the Respondent’s acts would most certainly be in breach of his fiduciary duty to the Club in allowing the Club to make the payments in respect of Suit 33 despite knowing that the Respondent’s acts fell outside the scope of the Indemnity Resolution. Further, the Respondent is not an innocent “third party” but is the very party who was in breach of duty towards the Club. Given these circumstances, the Respondent cannot rely on the knowledge of any member of the 2008 MC who might have known of the true nature of the Respondent’s acts to argue that the Club thus had knowledge and could not have been mistaken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In the result, we find that the Club had made the payments <span class="font-italic">before</span> the release of the CA Defamation Judgment under the mistaken belief that the Respondent was properly discharging his duty to the Club in making the defamatory statements and that Suit 33 fell within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution. It was only when the CA Defamation Judgment was released that the Club realised its mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 But the Club can no longer be said to be labouring under such a mistake when it made the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">after </span>the release of the CA Defamation Judgment (see [50] above). By the time these five payments were made, the Club was already cognisant of the fact that the Respondent was motivated by personal vendetta and malice when he made the defamatory statements. Pertinently, by the time of the last two payments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the payments of $1,021,793.48 to WongPartnership on 14 February 2012 and $60,297.90 to Bajwa &amp; Co on 1 March 2012), over 500 of its members had attempted to stop any further payments in respect of Suit 33 by requisitioning for the EGM (refer to [41] above). It may be argued – as the Club has (see [132] below) – that the persons who had allowed these payments to be made, despite the impending 4 March EGM and the clear objections from a significant number of members, had done so in breach of their fiduciary duty towards the Club. We will address the Club’s submissions in respect of the breach of fiduciary duty by the Respondent in a moment. For the purposes of the analysis on the Club’s claim in unjust enrichment, it is sufficient to say that the Club was no longer operating under any such mistake when it made the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments. But as we shall see in a moment, this does not mean that the Club cannot recover those payments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Before we end off on this portion of the analysis, we will just touch on the point made by the Judge at [225] of the GD that “the 2011 MC’s decision to re-affirm the Indemnity Resolution and continue paying the [Respondent’s] legal costs after the CA [Defamation] Judgment was delivered also goes against the notion that the Club had made previous payments under a <span class="font-italic">causative</span> mistake”. With respect, we are unable to agree with the Judge on this issue. As we have pointed out at [97(b)] above, the mistake, in our judgment, was causative in nature. The events that had transpired following the release of the CA Defamation Judgment, in particular the fact that the 4 March EGM was held, that the EGM Resolutions were passed, and that thereafter the Club stopped making payments in respect of Suit 33, clearly demonstrated that the mistake was causative and operative. The post-CA Defamation Judgment payments took place before the members of the Club could react and convene an EGM – as they eventually did – to stop the Club from making any further payments. In our view, it is clear that the Respondent as well as those in the 2011 MC who were sympathetic to him were acting to pre-empt any action which the general body of the Club could take by arranging and allowing for the payments to be made before the 4 March EGM could be held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For the reasons above, we find that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The payments made by the Club <span class="font-italic">before </span>the release of the CA Defamation Judgment were effected as a result of the Club’s mistaken belief that the Respondent’s conduct in making the defamatory statements fell within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) But the payments made <span class="font-italic">after </span>the release of the judgment, were not made under such a mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In these circumstances, we hold that the Club would be entitled to the repayment of the sums that were paid before the release of the CA Defamation Judgment from the Respondent under its unjust enrichment claim unless the Respondent can successfully raise any defences.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Respondent can rely on any defences </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In this regard, Mr Seah argues that the Respondent can rely on the defences of (i) estoppel <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>(ii) estoppel by convention and (iii) change in position. We note that the Respondent attempted to rely on the defence of settled position of law in the court below but appears to have dropped this defence on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 We will first briefly set out the law on the three defences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The defence of estoppel generally requires that the claimant had made a representation of fact to the defendant that the latter is entitled to the benefit that he has received, and that the defendant had changed his position to his detriment in reliance on the representation, making it inequitable for the claimant to resile from it (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 30.01).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The defence of estoppel by convention requires that there be an assumed state of fact or law in the course of dealing, which was shared by both parties or made by one party and acquiesced to by the other party, and that it would be unjust or unconscionable to allow a party to go back on that assumption (<span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others </span>[2008] 2 SLR (R) 474 at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Moving on to the defence of change in position, this requires the defendant to have changed his position so much that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, or alternatively restitution in full (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span><span class="font-italic"> Gorman </span>[1991] 2 AC 548 (“<span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>”) at 580 and <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at 27-01). The defence of change in position would not apply where the defendant has changed his position in bad faith, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where a defendant paid the money away with the knowledge of the facts entitling the claimant to restitution (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 580). The courts have cautioned that the analysis in relation to this defence must proceed in a principled way such that a fair balance is struck between the claimant’s interest in restitution and the defendant’s interest in making spending decisions freely, without fear that a claim in unjust enrichment might later invalidate the assumptions that he makes about the means at his disposal (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 27-03). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Mr Seah submits that all three defences, which have overlapping requirements, are satisfied because the Club had represented to the Respondent that it would cover his legal costs in relation to Suit 33, which representation the Respondent relied on in appointing Mr Nair from D&amp;N, whom he would not otherwise have hired as he could not afford to do so.

Further, we would underscore that three of the payments, one of which was for the substantial sum of $1,021,793.48, had been procured after some 500 members had requisitioned for an EGM in order to prevent further payments from being made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The Judge did not allow this claim as he found that the Respondent did not have <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>or <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> control over the payments (at [189]–[190] of the GD), and was “only forwarding invoices to Jennifer Wee requesting her further action” (at [191] of the GD). He concluded from the evidence that the Respondent had neither instructed nor approved the payments and that the Club had not pleaded or adduced any evidence at trial to prove that the Club’s treasurer, WT Tan, and its financial controller, Jennifer Wee, were acting at the Respondent’s behest when they approved or made the payments in relation to Suit 33 (at [196] of the Judgment). Further, the Judge found that the Club’s claim would have failed even if the Club succeeded in proving that the Respondent had procured the payments because the Club had failed to show that the Respondent did not honestly believe that he was entitled to rely on the Indemnity Resolution (at [197] of the GD).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 With respect, we do not think that the Club’s claim in this regard should be interpreted in such a narrow manner. In our opinion, the Respondent cannot distance himself from the Club’s making of the payments simply by saying that he did not sign the cheques or that he had no authority to approve the payments and was merely tendering the invoices to Jennifer Wee for the Club to make its own decision on whether the payments should be made. In viewing the actions of the Club’s treasurer and financial controller, it must be borne in mind that the Respondent was the president and a fiduciary of the Club at all material times when the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments were made. Barring any decision to the contrary by the management committee or the general body at an AGM or an EGM, he was the executive head of the Club. The Respondent does not deny – and rightly so, as this argument would have had no merit – that he owed fiduciary duties to the Club as its president. What he disputes is the Club’s contention that he had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Millett LJ (as he then was) described a fiduciary as follows in <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew </span>[1998] Ch 1 (at 18):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular manner or circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is trite that the various fiduciary duties such as the duty not to profit from position, the duty not to place oneself in a position of conflict of interest arise from this core obligation of loyalty that the fiduciary owes to the principal (see Peter Watts and F M B Reynolds, <span class="font-italic">Bowstead</span><span class="font-italic"> and Reynolds on Agency </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014) at para 6.034).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In our judgment, the Respondent had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to the Club as he had acted with the intention of furthering his own interests rather than the interests of the Club. There could have been no doubt after the release of the CA Defamation Judgment and even more so after the receipt of the members’ letter requisitioning an EGM that stated that no further payments should be made towards Suit 33 and related matters until the Club’s position on this issue was clarified by the general body. In particular, the significance of the requisition by some 500 members for an EGM to consider and approve the three draft resolutions, one of which was to ensure that hereafter no payment would be made by the Club in respect of the legal costs incurred by the Respondent in Suit 33 and the appeals therefrom, could not have been lost on him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 We recognise that the Club’s practice in relation to the payments of the Respondent’s legal expenses under the Indemnity Resolution had been to channel the invoices to the treasurer and the financial controller for action in accordance with section 4.3.2 of the FOM. But the situation was clearly different after the release of the CA Defamation Judgment and, without a doubt, after the receipt of the requisition notice. By then, the question of whether the Respondent’s legal costs fell within the scope of the Indemnity Resolution and whether the members were still willing to indemnify him had arisen. This question was not one that should, or could, have been resolved by the Respondent or the treasurer and financial controller alone. The conflict between the Respondent’s duty to the Club and his self-interest in respect of the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments was obvious. In these circumstances, the Respondent should have, at the very least, asked the vice-president, who was the next senior person in the Club, to take control of this matter and either call for a meeting of the management committee or an EGM in order to ascertain the Club’s position post-CA Defamation Judgment or take any other action he deems fit. This was not done. Instead, the Respondent continued to hand invoices over to the treasurer and financial controller for payments to be made on the pretext that this was pursuant to the Club’s usual protocol. In our view, no responsible president of a club in such a situation should have done so. Further, we also note that, despite his clear interest in the matter, the Respondent had chaired the special confidential management committee meeting on 18 January 2012 (see [43] above) during which the management committee discussed the requisition and the proposed EGM Resolutions and unanimously re-affirmed that the Indemnity Resolution should still apply in respect of the Respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In our view, the way in which the Respondent had acted in the face of an impending EGM can hardly indicate good faith. The circumstances of the payments, in particular the payment of $1,021,793.48 to WongPartnership, show that the Respondent was anxious to obtain payments of those legal bills before the guillotine came down and the members of the Club reacted – as they eventually did – to stop further payments from being made. While no direct threat or direction was uttered by the Respondent to WT Tan or Jennifer Wee, implicit in the email sent by the Respondent in respect of the invoices sent by WongPartnership was an obvious message that they should make the payments speedily ostensibly on the ground that delay in making payment could result in more interest being incurred (see [47] above). We find it difficult to believe the Respondent’s assertion that he had sought the payment to WongPartnership in such a hurried manner just so as to prevent the Club from incurring further interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In these circumstances, we have to respectfully disagree with the Judge and instead find that the Respondent had acted in breach of his fiduciary duty to the Club in procuring the post-CA Defamation Judgment payments, which were not in the Club’s interest to make. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For all the reasons stated above, we allow the Club’s appeal with costs here and below, to be taxed if not agreed. The Respondent is to repay the Club a total amount of $1,520,685.44, consisting of:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the sum of $1,033,810.35, which is the amount of $1,053,815.31 paid by the Club before the release of the CA Defamation Judgment less the refund of $20,004.96 that had been made to the Club by D&amp;N and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the further sum of $486,875.09, which is the amount of $1,211,811.64 paid by the Club post-CA Defamation Judgment, less the refund of costs effected by the Four Members who were the plaintiffs in Suit 33 pursuant to orders of court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The sum of $1,520,685.44 shall bear interest at 5.33% per annum with effect from 18 June 2012, the date of the writ in Suit 510.
