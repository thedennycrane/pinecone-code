The Prosecution objected to this application, taking the position that immediate access to counsel on 23 August 2023 would not be in the public interest as it would disrupt the Police’s ability to discharge their duty and carry out investigations in an effective and expeditious manner. The Prosecution, however, stated at the hearing that it was prepared for the Applicant to be granted access to counsel “from 29 August 2023, subject to the Commercial Affairs Department’s (“CAD”) operational constraints”.

But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Similarly, Yong CJ stated in <span class="font-italic">Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 196 at [19] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court’s immediate duty is to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court.

This is because the 23 August 2023 Orders have been superseded by the 30 August 2023 Orders.

</div>
</div>
</div> it is important to recognise that the typical evidential rules do not apply in such proceedings, which are meant to be dealt with in a summary way. This was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sollihin bin Anhar </span>[2015] 3 SLR 447 (at [38]) when it set out the type of evidence which the court may rely upon in dealing with applications regarding the granting and revocation of bail:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… conclusive evidence is certainly not the applicable standard when a court decides whether to revoke the bail granted to an accused under s 102(1) or 103(4) of the CPC. Even if it did involve hearsay evidence, a court in bail proceedings does not have to apply the strict evidential rules applicable to trials. Affidavit evidence is frequently relied upon in applications regarding the granting or revocation of bail which, as we have already noted, are to be dealt with quickly and in a summary way. At such proceedings, the court is therefore entitled to have regard to hearsay evidence subject to evaluating it and assigning it the appropriate weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In my view, such considerations would similarly apply when evaluating whether an order should be made under s 238(3) of the CPC for an accused person to be remanded. Section 238(3) of the CPC only requires the court to consider whether it <span class="font-italic">appears</span> <span class="font-italic">likely </span>that further evidence <span class="font-italic">may</span> be obtained by a remand. The threshold is clearly not a high one. This would also explain why, when an order is made under s 238(3) of the CPC for the accused to be further remanded, the statutory provision limits the length of remand to not more than eight days <span class="font-italic">at a time</span>. This is meant to strike a balance between allowing the Police the time and space to conduct its investigations effectively whilst safeguarding the interests of an accused person by regularly reviewing the need for further remand and only ordering further remand for a limited period of no more than eight days at a time. In my view, the Prosecution was, therefore, entitled to rely primarily on its oral submissions to support its application for further remand at the hearing on 23 August 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As the DJ observed, the Applicant’s contention that the Prosecution was obliged to provide affidavit evidence to support its application for further remand of the Applicant is neither a requirement stipulated in s 238(3) of the CPC nor one that is supported by a careful reading of the language of s 238(3) of the CPC. Given that section 238(3) of the CPC only requires the court to consider whether it <span class="font-italic">appears </span>likely that further evidence may be obtained by a period of remand rather than for this to be <span class="font-italic">proved</span>, the Applicant’s argument that the Prosecution needed to provide affidavit evidence is untenable: see the DJ’s GD at [13]–[16].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 More significantly, as the DJ highlighted, the nature of remand applications is such that there is a need for remand applications to be heard <span class="font-italic">expeditiously</span>. On this point, I fully agree with the explanation offered by the DJ on why an application of the strict rules of evidence to remand applications would be wholly incompatible with the public interest. I reproduce his explanation in full below (see the DJ’s GD at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20  … it is incompatible with public interest to apply strict rules of evidence to remand applications. Let me explain.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  First, there is typically a need for remand applications to be heard expeditiously – to prevent (i) criminal proceeds from being dissipated, (ii) evidence from disappearing or being corrupted, and (iii) suspects from absconding. To require remand applications to be supported with affidavit evidence will cause delay and can thus compromise investigations. <span class="font-italic">Further</span> delay can arise if an accused person requires time to tender rebuttal affidavits.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Second, it is not unusual for remand applications to be based only on educated assumptions on possible investigative leads, as well as evidence that is hearsay, incomplete, or even inconsistent. This is because during the early stages of investigations (when remand applications are made), investigators will often not have a clear idea of whether an offence – and if so, what offence – is disclosed. Frequently, investigators will need to sieve through evidence from (i) witnesses who may be uncooperative, forgetful, and/or mistaken, and (ii) suspects who may have taken steps to hide their crime. Given these circumstances, it is not reasonable to use the same evidential yardstick applicable to trials to assess remand applications. It bears emphasis that when assessing a remand application, the issue is simply whether an accused person’s remand would assist in obtaining <span class="font-italic">further evidence of an offence </span>– and not whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the accused person is guilty of an offence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  Finally, to require that remand applications be supported by affidavit evidence can lead to the injurious disclosure of confidential investigative methods and findings. Such a disclosure can jeopardise the investigations – not just in an accused person’s case, but in future cases as well.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Second, looking at the submissions of the Prosecution in support of its position for further remand, the investigations were at a preliminary stage as of 23 August 2023.

</div> In the present case, the Prosecution highlights that it had committed at the hearing on 23 August 2023 to allowing the Applicant access to counsel from 29 August 2023, subject to the operational constraints of the CAD. Given that the Applicant was arrested on 15 August 2023, this would have meant that the duration of non-access to counsel would have only been two weeks. The Prosecution states that its position was a reasonable one. Given the sensitive and complex nature of the investigations in the present case, the Police had to focus on following up on new leads and gathering evidence while it still remained available.

As set out in <span class="font-italic">Jasbir Singh and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 782 (at [45]–[49]), while an accused person has a right to counsel, this right is not one which must be granted to him immediately.

The Prosecution highlights that four further CDSA charges had been tendered against the Applicant at the hearing on 30 August 2023. However, extensive investigations still needed to be carried out, which included the recording of further statements, the review and receipt of voluminous data and the conducting of checks with foreign authorities.

This included the recording of further statements from the Applicant about information received from the other suspects and persons of interest.

</div> In light of the above, the CAD made the assessment that there was a real risk of collusion and contamination of evidence if the Applicant were to be released before the CAD had obtained the further evidence it required. In my view, based on the details of the pending investigation and the CAD’s reasons for its assessment that there was a real risk of collusion and contamination of evidence, there was clearly a need for the Applicant to be further remanded for a period of eight days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Further, I wish to state that I agree with the DJ’s observations on when an application for further remand typically ought not to be granted: (a) where remand is sought merely for the investigator’s convenience; (b) where remand is sought for the improper motive of pressuring an accused person to confess to an offence; (c) where previous remand has failed to provide any further evidence; (d) where remand is sought for a minor offence which attracts a low fine even if the accused person is convicted; or (e) where remand would significantly exacerbate an accused person’s illness which cannot be remedied by changing the conditions of remand (see the DJ’s GD at [30]). In such situations, it is clear that the prejudice caused to an accused person by allowing an application for further remand would be disproportionate to the investigative benefits of his remand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The present case, however, was clearly not a case like the ones listed above. The present case involved a complex investigation, where previous periods of remand had clearly led to further evidence being obtained, and where it appeared likely that a further period of remand may lead to new evidence being obtained. In my view, therefore, there was nothing palpably wrong with the DJ’s order on 30 August 2023 for the Applicant to be further remanded for a period of eight days.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The DJ’s order on 30 August 2023 that the Applicant be granted access to counsel, subject to the operational constraints of the CAD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Applicant further argues that the DJ erred in ordering that the Applicant be granted access to counsel <span class="font-italic">with the caveat</span> that this was subject to the operational constraints of the CAD.

</div> The Prosecution argues, however, that such caveats are entirely consistent with the principle that the right of access must be balanced against the public interest. Further, access could not be expected to be entirely unfettered so long as the Applicant remained in remand.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, there was nothing palpably wrong with the order on 30 August 2023 that the Applicant be granted access to counsel, subject to the operational constraints of the CAD. First, the Prosecution had earlier explained in its correspondence with the Applicant’s counsel what the operational constraints entailed: (a) a time constraint, given the need for the CAD to conduct its investigations whilst allowing all the suspects access to their counsels; and (b) a space constraint, which limited the number of persons who could meet a suspect at any point.

</div> Second, the Prosecution had also made clear during the hearing that the Applicant’s counsel could write to the Prosecution with its specific request relating to the Applicant’s access to counsel. This was a reasonable position. In fact, this was precisely what the Applicant’s counsel did subsequently when it wrote to the CAD requesting the Applicant to be allowed access to counsel for two hours on 5 September 2023, and for three persons to be allowed to meet the Applicant. This request was acceded to by the CAD, and the meeting took place on 5 September 2023.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 At the hearing before me today, the Applicant’s counsel, Mr Wong Hin Pkin Wendell (“Mr Wong”), stated that the Applicant ought to be granted “liberal access” to counsel if the Applicant were ordered to remain in remand. When probed further about what “liberal access” entailed, Mr Wong stated that the following would be ideal: (a) the Applicant ought to be granted access to counsel between to two to three times over the eight-day period when the Applicant is further remanded; and (b) an allowance should be made for each meeting between the Applicant and the counsel to last between one to two hours. Mr Wong also raised various concerns about the venue offered for previous meetings between the Applicant and his counsel. However, Mr Wong conceded that he had not submitted requests on these issues to the Prosecution before the hearing today. Given that the DJ had already ordered that the Applicant be granted access to counsel, subject to the operational constraints of the CAD, there was nothing stopping Mr Wong from writing to the CAD or the Prosecution to make these specific requests. At the hearing today, the Prosecution took the view that there was no “serious injustice” caused, and the Applicant was granted access to counsel from 29 August 2023 whenever a request was made by the Applicant’s counsel. The Prosecution was, however, unable to commit to “liberal access” in the terms defined by Mr Wong. Instead, the Prosecution invited Mr Wong to write to the CAD or the Prosecution to make these specific requests for them to be considered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, this is not an unreasonable position. I agree that Mr Wong should make these requests to the CAD or the Prosecution first before seeking a court order. In any case, the threshold for criminal revision is not met, given that there has been no “serious injustice” occasioned by the DJ’s order as it stands.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Finally, Mr Wong also raised a concern at the hearing before me today that there have been restrictions placed by the CAD on the Applicant’s access to various family members. However, strictly speaking, based on the Petition for Revision filed by the Applicant, no prayer was made by the Applicant in relation to the DJ’s order relating to the Applicant’s access to his family members. Further, it appears that restrictions have been placed on the Applicant’s access to various family members as investigative statements have been recorded or will be recorded from these family members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I note that the DJ made an order at the hearing on 30 August 2023 that the Applicant be granted access to his family members. However, Mr Wong stated at the hearing before me today that the DJ was not informed by either party on 30 August 2023 on the fact that statements have been recorded or will be recorded from various family members. In view of this, I find that it would be more appropriate for the parties to raise these concerns relating to the Applicant’s access to his family members to the DJ at the next hearing in the court below. The DJ can then make any further order as he deems appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the reasons above, I do not find that the District Court’s orders of 23 August 2023 and 30 August 2023 can be described as wrong, much less palpably wrong, such as to meet the high threshold of “serious injustice” on which any exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers is contingent. As the threshold for the High Court’s revisionary power under s 401 of the CPC to be exercised has not been met, I dismiss the Applicant’s application.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Andrew Chua Ruiming and Yang Xinyan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the applicant; and</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Ng Yiwen, David Koh and Kang Jia Hui <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
