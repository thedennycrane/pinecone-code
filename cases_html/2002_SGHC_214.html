<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This is a sequel to Suit

No. 1777 of 1999, a case concerning a fire that occurred on 20 February 1999 at Senang

Crescent. In the trial of Suit No. 1777 of 1999 the owners and occupiers of No. 23 Senang

Crescent sued the owners of the next door premises, No. 25 (the first defendants), the

tenants who occupied the top floor of No. 25 (the second defendants), and the sub-tenants

of the second defendants who occupied the lower floor of No. 25 (the third defendants).

The causes of action in that suit were based on negligence as well as under the rule in <i>Rylands

v Fletcher</i>. The claim against the first and second defendants were dismissed at the

close of the plaintiffs’ case. It was found that no liability attached to the owners

and tenants in law on the case pleaded. The claim against the third defendants (who

elected to call evidence) was allowed. The plaintiffs there appealed against the dismissal

of their claim against the first and second defendants. The third defendants appealed

against the finding of liability against them. Both appeals were subsequently dismissed by

the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        In the present action, the

first, second, and third plaintiffs alleged that they were the occupiers of No. 21, 35 and

37 Senang Crescent respectively at the material time, namely 20 February 1999. These were

the premises behind No. 23 and No. 25. The fourth, fifth and sixth plaintiffs alleged that

they were the owners of No. 21, 35 and 37 of Senang Crescent respectively. The defendants

in this action were the owners of No. 25 (the first defendants in the previous suit).

Their tenants, and more importantly, the sub-tenants who were found liable in Suit No.

1777 of 1999 were not joined as parties in the present Suit. Mr. Gn, counsel for the

present plaintiffs (and who also represented the plaintiffs in Suit No. 1777 of 1999)

informed the court that the sub-tenants are not being sued because they have no means of

making payment should they be found liable. Mr. Gn also stated that the present claim was

brought by way of subrogation by the insurance company of the plaintiffs. The causes of

action in the present action are based on the rule in <i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>,

negligence and nuisance. At the outset, counsel withdrew the claim based on the rule in <i>Rylands

v Fletcher</i>. For completeness, it should be noted that in the previous action in Suit

No. 1777 of 1999 the plaintiffs there did not sue in nuisance.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        In view of the connection

with the facts in Suit No. 1777 of 1999, counsel were asked if they could agree facts and

evidence to expedite the trial. However, counsel after conferring with each other, were

only able to agree that there was a fire at No. 23 and No. 25 Senang Crescent on 20

February 1999 and that the fire started at the front yard of No. 25.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        Mr. Gn advanced the

present case on the basis of only one point. He submitted that the three fuse wires found

in the fuse holder in No. 25 Senang Crescent after the fire, had been tampered with as

early as 1978, but certainly before the tenants (in Suit No. 1777 of 1999) began their

tenancy. His entire case was constructed on the following premises. First, the fire was

caused by the escape of electricity "through the electrical fuses and found its way

into the front yard of No. 25." Secondly, the fuses were tampered or up-rated.

Thirdly, the defendants failed to inspect the fuse holder, or maintain proper fuses in the

holder before handing the premises over to their tenants (in the case presently pleaded,

the tenants referred to were the second defendants in Suit No. 1777 of 1999). The

statement of claim elaborated on a number of other particulars of negligence but they fall

essentially within the three broad categories that I have just set out. I shall have to

revert to the plaintiffs' pleadings shortly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Significantly, none of the

plaintiffs gave evidence at all. The only witnesses called on their behalf were a couple

of clerks to produce certified true copies of certificates of titles in respect of 21, 35

and 37 Senang Crescent, as well as a couple of loss adjusters testifying that they spoke

to some of the plaintiffs who claim to be owners or occupiers of the said premises. One of

them, Mr. Yeo Peck Hong admitted that he had no personal knowledge but had formed his

opinion on the basis that he had seen invoices and insurance policies from the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs' evidence was mainly from Prof. Jimmy Chen and Mr. Tan Jin Thong, the two

experts who gave expert evidence in the trial of Suit No. 1777 of 1999, as well as Mr. Yee

Kum Choon who gave evidence in that same suit as a witness of fact, but returning in this

trial to give expert evidence on the size of wires. I overruled Mr. Cheong's objection to

Mr. Yee being called as such, and I am mindful of the peculiar nature of such evidence,

and whether there is such a person who can be called a "wire expert".

Consequently, I am of the view that the evidence will be permitted, but whether it amounts

to anything is a matter for submission. Another expert, Dr. Jonathan Lloyd was called to

give evidence as to the cause of the condition of the three strands of wires found in the

fuse holder in 25 Senang Crescent. He was of the view that the brittleness of the wires

was due to heat created by an electrical current (as opposed to direct external heat). The

plaintiffs' evidence was that the measurement of the diameter of the wires was 0.71mm (and

not, counsel conceded, 0.75mm as Mr. Yee Kum Choon testified in the previous trial). Also

relying, in part, on the evidence of Mr. Ng Kong, a director of the Energy Market

Authority, that after 1 September 1978 the old Imperial gauge wires were officially to be

replaced by new metric gauge (0.75mm) wires, Mr. Gn then put the plaintiffs' case on the

basis that the wires must have been changed before 1 September 1978. He next relied on the

obviously hearsay evidence of Mr. Lu Hui Huang, who had occupied the upper floor of 25

Senang Crescent sometime from November 1987 to May 1994 when he moved next door to 23

Senang Crescent. He said that he noticed that the lower floor was ‘unoccupied by

tenants’ for a couple of weeks in July 1988 and January 1989. He admitted under

cross-examination that he did not know whether the premises were let out during the period

which he said the premises at 25 Senang Crescent were unoccupied.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Mr. Gn constructed his

case on the basis of the evidence above. He submitted that three "tampered, rewired,

and up-rated electrical fuses constituted [a] fire hazard". The fuses served the wire

that had short-circuited in the front yard of 25 Senang Crescent. Between 1979 and 1999

the defendants were in control of the lower floor of those premises. The fire started in

the front yard of 25 Senang Crescent. The defendants are therefore liable, in nuisance and

negligence, because they "repeatedly let out the premises without checking and

rectifying the electrical fire hazards".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        At the close of the

plaintiffs' case Mr. Cheong, counsel for the defendants, applied for leave to submit no

case to answer without being put to election that no evidence will be called on behalf of

the defendants. He produced a Practice Note entitled <i>Submitting 'No Case To Answer'</i>

which is reproduced in [1932] MLJ 61 which reports that the Registrar of the Supreme

Court, in answer to an inquiry by the Law Society, replied that the Council of Judges (in

Singapore) had ruled that we should adopt the same practice as that in the King's Bench

Division in England, as opposed to the practice in the Chancery Division in which a

defendant making a submission of no case to answer is put to election. However, Mr. Cheong

conceded that in recent times, the Court of Appeal had ruled otherwise. In <i>Tan Song Gou

v Goh Ya Tian</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8422&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1983] 1 MLJ 60</a>, 62 the opinion of the trial judge was approved by the

Court of Appeal in the following passage: "We agree with the observation of Lai Kew

Chai J. that the proper practice, if counsel for a defendant wishes to make a submission

of no case to answer, is for the judge to refuse to rule on it unless counsel elects to

call no evidence". In the more recent case of <i>Central bank of India v Hemant

Govindaprasad Bansal</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63467&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 3 SLR 190</a>, 196 Rajendran J was also of the view that the

defendant must be put to election. Mr. Cheong submitted that the Practice Note of 1932 was

not brought to the attention of the courts in the cases cited. Furthermore, he relied on

Australian authorities that appear to favour the King's Bench practice in holding that the

court has a discretion not to put the defendant to election. <i>Rasomen v Shell</i> (1996)

142 ALR 135 was cited in support. Notwithstanding that the Practice Note of 1932 (on a

decision made in 1930) emanated from the Council of Judges, a High Court judge is bound by

the decisions of the Court of Appeal. In this regard, it was not necessary for me to

express any further view on this issue, and accordingly, I ruled that I would not hear a

submission of no case to meet unless the defendants elect not to call evidence.

Consequently, Mr Cheong declined to make a submission of no case to meet.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        Only two witnesses were

called on behalf of the defendants. The first was Mr. Lee Hock Chuan, the youngest son of

the owner of 25 Senang Crescent who testified that after his father's death he took over

the management of the premises. The other plaintiffs are his siblings. He testified that

as far as he knew, the premises were let out to tenants ever since they were purchased in

1970. The date of purchase was not challenged but Mr. Gn pointed out that the various

tenancy agreements produced by the defendants appear to overlap. He submitted that the

inference must be that the previous tenant had moved out before the new tenancy took

effect. This was denied by Mr. Lee. In my view, the mere overlap does not mean that the

premises were left untenanted although there may be a week or two in which they were

unoccupied. On the evidence, I am unable to find that there were any period of time in

which the defendants had exclusive right of possession of the premises in 25 Senang

Crescent, or that the premises were indeed left unoccupied for any period. The evidence

from Mr. Lu is unreliable, and the inference that Mr. Gn wants me to draw from the tenancy

agreements is too tenuous. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        There are a great deal

more problems in the plaintiffs' case. First, to succeed in nuisance or negligence, the

plaintiff must prove damage. In this case damage was not even pleaded save that the

statement of claim prays for specific sums in respect of each plaintiff with no

particulars as to the type or nature of damage. This is inadequate. A plaintiff cannot

merely pray for a specific sum of money (for example, $65,487.85 for the first plaintiff

in this case) without telling the defendant (and the court) what the damage was. It was

left to Mr. Gn to inform me from the Bar (therefore, of no evidential value so far as the

merits of the case are concerned) that the damage to the plaintiffs was not caused by

direct fire but by heat caused by the fire. Counsel did not even tell me whether the

resulting damage was to the premises (and if so, where) or to chattels (and if so, what).

It is no answer for him to say that the registry had fixed the matter for trial on

liability only with damages to be assessed at a later date. That is clearly a confusion

between damage and damages. The latter is relevant only when the former has been pleaded

and proved. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        Furthermore, a plaintiff

who sues in private nuisance must first prove that he has an interest in land because

nuisance is a tort against land. See <i>The Law of Torts</i>, Common Law Series, 2002 Ed,

Ch 22 page 901 for a detailed historical background to this tort. Whatever the plaintiff

may recover from the defendant depends on the interest that he (the plaintiff) has. Hence,

the licensee in <i>Malone v Laskey</i> [1907] 2 KB 141 was held to have insufficient

interest in land to sue the next door occupier in nuisance. It follows that the plaintiffs

must plead and adduce evidence of their respective interests in land. The case for the

first, second, and third plaintiffs in this case must fail from the outset because they

claim as 'occupiers'. That is clearly insufficient. The fourth, fifth, and sixth

plaintiffs claim as owners. Not a single affidavit of evidence-in-chief was filed by any

one of the six plaintiffs. If the owner is not in occupation, then he can only succeed if

he can show that he had a right of immediate possession, or that he suffered damage in

respect of his reversionary interest. See <i>Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co</i>

[1895] 1 Ch 287, 312, per Lindley LJ. Nothing to this effect was pleaded nor proved. The

certified true copies of title deeds produced by the solicitor's clerk only prove

ownership at best, but, as I said, mere ownership is not sufficient, especially where, as

in this case, it is not known who had possession or right to immediate possession of the

premises known as 21, 35, and 37 Senang Crescent. The certificates also show that the

properties were mortgaged at the material time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        Thus, the claim by the

fourth, fifth and sixth plaintiffs must also fail. The plaintiffs' basis for asserting

that the defendants are liable in negligence in not checking or maintaining the fuse

holder must fail on the case as presented by Mr. Gn - which was that the defendants had a

window period in which they had the right to exclusive possession (although Mr. Gn used

the term 'having possession and control'). Even if the defendants had exclusive possession

at a relevant time, there is yet another fundamental reason why the plaintiffs' claim in

negligence must fail. There is no basis for finding a duty of care on the part of an

owner, to third parties, to make periodic checks on the electrical system of his premises.

The duties and obligations of the landlord are owed to his tenant. To succeed in

negligence against the landlord, a third party has to prove a specific duty of care.

Generally, the duty of care in negligence does not include acts of omission, which is

essentially the case presented by Mr. Gn against the defendants. Thus, his reliance on <i>Virco

Metal Industrial Pte Ltd v Carltech Trading &amp; Industries Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=51033&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 2 SLR 201</a>

is misplaced because the facts are entirely different. The faulty power switch there was

installed by the defendants in that case. In the present case, the breach of duty alleged

was in failing to find out that there was a faulty fuse. There is more. Mr. Gn adduced no

evidence to show that the fuse holder was faulty and that it was that fuse holder that

caused the fire. I had asked if parties were able to agree facts at the beginning of this

trial, but no material facts were agreed other than that a fire started in the front yard

of 25 Senang Crescent on 20 February 1999. That being so, the plaintiffs were obliged to

prove their case with evidence. Mr. Gn sought to rely on the findings of fact in the

grounds of judgment in Suit No. 1777 of 1999. The findings of fact are not evidence in

this regard - it is merely the opinion of a court as to what facts he thought existed in

the case upon which he was trying. They cannot be used as evidence to prove primary facts

that are incumbent upon a party to prove in another trial. In a separate and independent

trial, evidence, unless agreed, must be properly adduced to prove what the parties have to

prove.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        Finally, I must address

the point in respect of what Mr Gn called the 'fresh evidence'. I am inclined to agree

with the opinion of Mr. Mullen that we cannot conclude that the three fuses were installed

prior to 1978 just by examining the measurement alone. Even if the measurement was

correctly taken, of which there is some doubt, especially since the measurement had been

taken in the previous trial and put to the court (by the same experts for the plaintiffs)

to be of a different gauge, one cannot draw the inference that it must have been installed

prior to 1978. Assuming that the regulations required new metric gauge wires after 1

September 1978, old wires that were still in stock might still have been used as Mr Mullen

also observed. The plaintiffs' witnesses confirmed that such changes can be performed by

any handyman and no inspection or testing is required to be made by the authorities

concerned. In any event, even if the wires were installed prior to 1978, they would have

been approved wires then. There is no evidence that the regulators required all such wires

to be changed to the new metric ones. Hence, it is also entirely plausible that the wires

might already have been changed in 1970 when the defendants bought the premises. There is

also no evidence that the three fuses were in contravention of any statutory regulation or

guideline. In any event, Mr. Gn concedes that the plaintiffs' case was not made on the

basis of a negligent act of installation, but on an omission to check. I have already

stated above that there is, in my opinion, no such duty in law applicable to the facts of

this case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        For the reasons above,

the plaintiffs' claim is dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
