However, the Act in all but one section consistently uses only the singular noun “contract” coupled with either the singular article “a” or “the”. There is only one section in the entire Act which refers to “contracts”, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span> in the plural. That is s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). But that section deals only with the disapplication of the Act to a prescribed “class of contracts”. That provision is not relevant to this question or to the analysis of it which follows in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I begin the analysis by considering four sections which are fundamental to the scheme of the Act. I consider them only insofar as they relate to construction contracts within the meaning of the Act, leaving aside for the moment supply contracts. These four sections are ss 2, 5, 10 and 12. They define or establish, in turn: (i) a progress payment, (ii) a claimant’s entitlement to a progress payment; (iii) a claimant’s power to serve a payment claim in respect of a progress payment; and (iv) a claimant’s entitlement to make an adjudication application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Section 2 defines a “progress payment”. It speaks expressly of a progress payment as a payment arising under “a contract”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“progress payment” means a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under <span class="font-italic">a contract</span> …;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Section 5 confers, for present purposes, a statutory entitlement to a progress payment on every person who carries out construction work. It too speaks expressly of an entitlement to a progress payment arising under “a contract”: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entitlement to progress payments</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.

A claimant has the power, under s 10(1) of the Act, to serve a payment claim in respect of “a progress payment”. Both ss 10(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 10(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) again refer expressly to “<span class="font-italic">the</span> contract”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.-—(1) A claimant may serve <span class="font-italic">one payment claim</span> in respect of a progress payment on —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) one or more other persons who, under <span class="font-italic">the contract</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline"> </span>concerned, is or may be liable to make the payment; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) such other person as specified in or identified in accordance with the terms of <span class="font-italic">the contract</span> for this purpose.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The purpose of these subsections is to stipulate on whom a payment claim must be served, rather than to tie one payment claim back to one contract.

The form and manner is prescribed by rule 5 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Rev Ed). Rule 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) once again contemplates a payment claim arising from only one contract. It requires a payment claim to “identify <span class="font-italic">the contract</span> to which the progress payment that is the subject of the payment claim relates” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Finally, s 12(1) of the Act establishes a claimant’s entitlement to make an adjudication application subject to certain conditions being met. This provision too uses the singular: “a … contract”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entitlement to make adjudication applications</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12. —(1) Subject to subsection (2), a claimant who, in relation to <span class="font-italic">a construction contract</span>, fails to receive payment by the due date of the response amount which he has accepted is entitled to make an adjudication application under section 13 in relation to the relevant payment claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where, in relation to <span class="font-italic">a construction contract</span> — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) A claimant who has served a payment claim in relation to <span class="font-italic">a supply contract</span> is entitled to make an adjudication application under section 13 in relation to the payment claim if — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The respondent is therefore correct that the Act mandates that a “payment claim” within the meaning of s 10 of the Act must arise from one contract.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This principle is consistent with the two Australian cases on which the respondent relies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The first case is the decision of McDougall J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (“NSW”) in <span class="font-italic">Rail Corporation </span><span class="font-italic">of New South Wales v Nebax Constructions Australia Pty Ltd</span> [2012] NSWSC 6 (“<span class="font-italic">Nebax</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Nebax</span>, the respondent argued that the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction over an adjudication because the applicant had either: (i) relied on one payment claim to initiate multiple adjudication applications; or (ii) submitted multiple payment claims under the same contract for the same reference period at the same time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 McDougall J considered the equivalent in the NSW security of payment legislation to ss 5, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of our Act. He upheld the respondent’s jurisdictional objection in principle. In the course of doing so, he expressed the view that the NSW Act requires one payment claim to arise from a single contract (at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to me that, because s 13(5) prevents … the service of more than one payment claim per reference date per construction contract, and because the right to adjudication “of a payment claim” is clearly referable to a payment claim that complies with the various requirements of s 13, there can only be one adjudication application for any particular payment claim <span class="font-italic">for any particular contract</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Although we have no statutory equivalent in the Act to s 13(5) of the New South Wales legislation, the same result has been achieved in Singapore by the interpretation put upon our Act by <span class="font-italic">Lee Wee Lick Terence</span><span class="font-italic"> (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Libra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The view expressed by McDougall J in<span class="font-italic"> Nebax </span>([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was undoubtedly <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. Neither party contended in that case that there was more than one contract between the parties. But McDougall J adopted this <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> as part of his <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> in his decision in <span class="font-italic">Class Electrical Services</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Go Electrical Pty Ltd</span> [2013] NSWSC 363 at [6] and [39]. Further, Douglas J of the Supreme Court of Queensland adopted McDougall J’s view as part of his <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> in the second case on which the respondent relies: <span class="font-italic">Matrix Projects (Qld) Pty Ltd v Luscombe </span>[2013] QSC 4 at [17] – [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is true that the NSW security of payment legislation considered in <span class="font-italic">Nebax </span>([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>differs from our Act in certain respects. But that legislation was the model for our Act and is underpinned by the same policy. In my view, there is no material difference between the two acts on this issue. McDougall J’s remarks, albeit against the backdrop of different security of payment legislation, are equally applicable in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It is also true that s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1 2002 Rev Ed) provides that “unless there is something in the subject or context inconsistent with such construction…words in the singular include the plural…” Section 2(1) does not operate, in my view, to permit me to read the singular – “a contract” or “the contract” – as including the plural, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span> more than one contract. That construction would be inconsistent with the subject and context of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Adjudication is, by legislative intent, a fast and low-cost process intended to ease an applicant’s cash flow under the principle of “pay now, argue later” (<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> [42] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [77]). An adjudicator’s determination of the parties’ dispute carries interim finality. Pending the resolution of the parties’ dispute with full finality, therefore, the legislation by design casts the risk of error in the adjudication on the respondent. The <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> which the Act extracts from the applicant is that it must come strictly within the terms of the legislative scheme, many of which are intended as safeguards for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 A requirement that an adjudication be founded on a single contract safeguards the respondent in the same way as the requirement that a claimant present only one payment claim in<span class="font-italic"> </span>any given payment claim period and for any given reference period. The purpose of the safeguard is to ensure that the respondent is able, within the limited time allowed by the Act, to examine and verify the facts and calculations relating to a payment claim and either to satisfy the claim or to serve a payment response (see Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication </span>(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5.150]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Applying s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act to read the singular “a contract” or “the contract” as including multiple contracts would permit a claimant to serve a payment claim which arises from more than one contract. Allowing claims and disputes which arise from several contracts – which may contain materially different terms, including materially different payment terms – to be confounded in one payment claim and thereafter in one adjudication application has the potential to cause unfairness to the respondent, to increase the decision-making burden on the adjudicator and thereby to increase costs and to increase delay in adjudication. All of that is antithetical to the purposes of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 By contrast, requiring one adjudication application to be founded on one payment claim which arises from one contract does not, in the vast majority of cases, create unnecessary technicality or a trap for the unwary. It is not a heavy administrative or financial burden to require a claimant who has several contracts with a respondent to issue a separate payment claim under each contract and, thereafter, to make a separate adjudication application founded on each payment claim. The rule, no doubt, gives respondents an incentive to argue for tactical rather than substantive reasons that the parties’ contractual relationship arises from multiple contracts. But it will be tolerably clear in all but the most ambiguous of cases whether that assertion is correctly made. And that risk does not, in my view, outweigh the considerable and real prejudice that the contrary interpretation would cause to respondents as a class and to the purposes of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It therefore appears to me that the Act, both on its face and in its underlying purpose, does require a claim for payment to arise from a single contract in order to be a “payment claim” within the meaning of the Act. A consideration of s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act does not lead me to a different conclusion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What is the effect of the adjudicator’s implicit finding?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The second subsidiary question is a point taken by the applicant. The applicant submits that I should not go behind the adjudicator’s implicit finding (see [25] above) that progress claim 24 arose from a single contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The respondent argues that I am not only free but obliged to examine the underlying facts and to determine for myself whether progress claim 24 arises from one contract or from two contracts.

Be that as it may, I will consider the applicant’s submissions on this issue on their merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The applicant relies heavily on <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([51] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In that case, the respondent in an adjudication took the point that the adjudicator had no jurisdiction over the parties’ disputes because they arose out of several separate contracts, only the first of which contained an agreement to adjudicate. The claimant’s response was that the agreement to adjudicate in the first contract covered even the disputes under the later contracts because they were not separate contracts at all but were simply variations to the first contract. The adjudicator decided in favour of the claimant on both jurisdiction and on the substance of the disputes. The applicant commenced proceedings in the English High Court seeking summary judgment in the same terms as the adjudicator’s decision. The respondent resisted summary judgment relying on the same jurisdictional point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Akenhead J accepted that the adjudicator did not have the power to determine his own jurisdiction. But he held also that the issue of whether the later contracts were separate contracts or merely variations of the first contract was an issue which went <span class="font-italic">both</span> to jurisdiction and <span class="font-italic">also</span> to the substance of the parties’ disputes. He found, therefore, that where “substance and jurisdiction overlap … it is within the [a]djudicator’s jurisdiction to decide as matters within his or her substantive jurisdiction whether there have been in effect variations to the contract pursuant to which he or she has properly been appointed [a]djudicator” (<span class="font-italic">Air Design </span>([51] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> ([51] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is authority for the proposition that, under the English security of payment scheme, where a single issue goes both to the substance of the dispute between the parties and to the adjudicator’s own jurisdiction, the adjudicator’s decision on that issue will bind the parties on both substance and jurisdiction notwithstanding the general rule that an English adjudicator has no power to determine his own jurisdiction. In those circumstances, an error by the adjudicator in arriving at his decision on that single issue will not deprive him of the jurisdiction to decide the substance of the parties’ dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The applicant invites me to apply that proposition to the present case. It argues that the issue of whether the respondent engaged the applicant under a single contract or under two contracts is an issue which the adjudicator had to decide in order to arrive at his determination on the substance of the dispute between the parties. As long as the adjudicator asked himself the right question, he acted within his jurisdiction. That is so even if he got the answer to that question wrong.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I do not accept the applicant’s submission. The respondent is correct that the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) has no application in the context of our security of payment scheme. That is because the <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> proposition is inconsistent with the comprehensive and considerable authority of <span class="font-italic">Chua Say</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra) </span>by which I am bound.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Say Eng </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra)</span>, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between two types of argument on a setting-aside application: (i) an argument asserting that an adjudicator was not clothed with the statutory authority to determine an adjudication application (at [37] and [66]); and (ii) an argument conceding that the adjudicator was clothed with that authority, but asserting that the claimant contravened a provision of the Act in invoking that authority (at [67]) or that the adjudicator contravened a provision of the Act in exercising that authority (at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 If an argument of the first type is well-founded, the inevitable result is that the adjudication application and any determination which results from it is a nullity (<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra) </span>at [66]). If an argument of the second type is well-founded, nullity is not the inevitable result. Instead, invalidity is the result. And even invalidity ensues only if the provision in question is so important that there is a legislative purpose to invalidate an act done in contravention of that provision (<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng </span>at [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Whichever type of argument a respondent raises, a court will have to assess and determine the argument for itself. It is not in any way bound to defer to any view the adjudicator may have expressed on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The proposition in <span class="font-italic">Air </span><span class="font-italic">Design</span> ([51] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is inconsistent with <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra)</span>. The foundation of the <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> proposition is an implied agreement between the parties that interim finality should attach to an adjudicator’s determination of an issue which touches on both substance and also to jurisdiction. The parties’ agreement has that effect in the English security of payment scheme because the juridical basis of the English security of payment scheme is the parties’ agreement. The agreement is either an express agreement between the parties or an agreement imputed to them by the English security of payment legislation through the mechanism of implied terms. So while the English scheme, like ours, takes as its starting point that an adjudicator has no power to determine his own jurisdiction, the origin of that bar is different. In the English scheme, the bar originates from the parties’ agreement. So too, the interim finality which is attached the adjudicator’s decision in the English scheme originates from the parties’ agreement. The parties’ agreement, express or implied, therefore suffices to lift that bar and to allow interim finality to attach to an English adjudicator’s determination of an issue which touches on his own jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The juridical basis of adjudication in Singapore is statutory. The powers of an adjudicator under our security of payment scheme are fixed by the Act. The parties cannot enlarge those powers by any agreement of any kind, whether express or implied. <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra) </span>makes clear (at [36]) that an adjudicator has no power under the Act to decide his own jurisdiction. An adjudicator cannot gain the power to decide his own jurisdiction by the mere fact that an issue which goes to his jurisdiction happens also to go to the substance of the parties’ dispute. In an exceptional situation, the adjudicator’s statutory obligation under s 16(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act to reject an adjudication application which has not been made in accordance with ss 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act may coincide with a respondent’s argument on jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng </span>at [64]). But even in that exceptional situation, the adjudicator’s determination carries interim finality and binds the parties not because of their agreement but because the Act has empowered him to decide that issue. The statutory basis of adjudication in Singapore means that the <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> proposition cannot apply to an adjudication under the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is also significant to me that the <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span> proposition ([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is not supported by any Singapore authority. Indeed, as the respondent points out, the proposition is positively contradicted by Loh J’s approach in <span class="font-italic">UES Holdings Pte Ltd v Grouteam Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 312 (“<span class="font-italic">UES</span>”).

</div> The respondent in <span class="font-italic">UES</span> alleged that a payment claim had not been served “at such time as specified in or determined in accordance with the terms of the contract” as required by s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. As in <span class="font-italic">Air Design</span>, that issue went both to the substance of the parties’ dispute and also to jurisdiction. Loh J, hearing the respondent’s application to set aside the determination, did not consider himself bound by the adjudicator’s finding that service of the payment claim complied with the parties’ contract. Instead, he construed the contract himself to determine the issue afresh. Having done so, he concluded that service of the payment claim did not comply with the parties’ contract as required by s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). He held further that that provision was so important that invalidity was the legislatively-intended consequence of non-compliance (see <span class="font-italic">UES </span>at [39] – [47]).

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is true that the applicant: (i) issued two separate quotations for each scope of work on 20 December 2012; (ii) each quotation incorporated a clause expressly providing that that quotation included only the items specified in the tender contract breakdown attached to that quotation; and (iii) that each quotation had annexed to it a different tender contract breakdown for each scope of work. That does suggest, as the respondent submits, that the parties entered into two contracts and not one. But in my view, none of these facts suffices to outweigh objectively the weight of the evidence I have analysed above pointing in the other direction. In my view, the quotations were separated for administrative convenience rather than with contractual effect. Further, the clause in question is a <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> clause in the <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> parts of the applicant’s quotations. It is therefore difficult to ascribe any specific objective intent to the applicant from the incorporation of that clause in these quotations as to whether it intended to form one contract or two with the respondent. It also appears to me that the objective intent of the parties, ascertained in context, was for the tender contract breakdown and the clause which referred to it to govern the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of the parties’ contract rather than its <span class="font-italic">formation</span>. Those breakdowns do not, therefore, advance the respondent’s submission that the parties’ objective intent was to enter into two contracts rather than one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I therefore find that the parties’ objective intent, when the applicant accepted the respondent’s counteroffer during their negotiations on 20 December 2012, was to enter into a single contract comprising two scopes of work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Post-contractual events, by definition, come after a contract is formed. A contract is formed when acceptance meets offer supported by consideration. Acceptance met offer in this case on 20 December 2012, when the applicant accepted the respondent’s counteroffer supported by consideration. The parties’ contractual relationship therefore formed on 20 December 2012. I have found that contractual relationship to consist of a single contract comprising two scopes of work. Nothing which occurred after 20 December 2012 can, in any contractual sense, split the single contract which I have found the parties to have entered into into two separate contracts short of a contractually-binding variation. The respondent does not suggest that there was any such variation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is strictly speaking, therefore, unnecessary for me to deal with the parties’ post-contractual conduct. This conduct includes the revised quotations dated 7 January 2013. It also includes the manner in which the parties dealt with progress claim submission, with progress claim payment and with invoicing. Nevertheless, since the parties have made submissions on these points, I will touch on them. I am also conscious that, although the parties’ post-contractual conduct is not admissible as an aid to construing or interpreting the content of their contractual obligations, that is not the task I am now undertaking. My task is to ascertain contractual formation, not contractual content.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As I have said, the revised quotations are, on my findings, post-contractual. It is thus irrelevant that the revised quotations, unlike the original quotations, contained different reference numbers. It is also irrelevant that the revised quotation for the fire alarm works included a new term. The effect of that new term was to exclude a dry riser system from the fire alarm works. That term no doubt became incorporated into the content of the parties’ contract on and from 7 January 2013, probably as a binding variation. But, as I have said, the content of the parties’ contract is not the question before me. The question before me is whether the parties objectively intended to enter into one contract or two. A dry riser system is relevant only to the fire alarm works. It has no relevance to the electrical works. To my mind, incorporating this new term in the revised quotation for the fire alarm works but not in the revised quotation for the electrical works validates the applicant’s practice of confining each quotation to a single scope of work for administrative convenience. Incorporating this new term does not go so far as to suggest that the parties believed, in January 2013, that they had entered into two separate contracts for two separate scopes of work in December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The applicant initially issued separate progress claims for each scope of work.

</div> Each of these 10 tax invoices was headed “Proposed A &amp; A Works to Multi-Storey Car Parks (Batch 7)”. That is, of course, the title of the main contract. Each tax invoice made no reference to the two scopes of work. Instead, each invoice tracked the parties’ cumulative progress payments and progress claims for both scopes of work against a single consolidated contract price of $740,000.

Section 12(2) entitles a claimant to make an adjudication application arising from construction contract only in relation to its “payment claim”. Section 13(1) provides that the subject-matter of an adjudication is a “payment claim dispute”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The language of ss 12(2) and 13(1), by relying on the term of art “payment claim” and incorporating it in the concept of a “payment claim dispute”, limits the subject-matter of an adjudication application to one or more disputes which arise from a “payment claim”. The payment claim therefore fixes the parameters of the substantive content of an adjudication application, subject only to any additional issues introduced by a duly-served payment response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Any other interpretation would be grossly unfair to a respondent. Section 15(3) bars a respondent from raising in its adjudication response any reasons for withholding payment that were not set out in its payment response. If a claimant were allowed to add a new claim to an adjudication application after it had served its payment claim on a respondent, s 15(3) would operate to bar a respondent who had not served a payment response from defending that claim. That bar would operate even though the respondent could not have foreseen that the claimant would make a new claim, could not have foreseen the content of that new claim and may have valid reasons for withholding payment on that new claim which it could and would have put in a payment response if that new claim had been made in the payment claim itself. An outcome which is unfair in that way cannot have been the intention of the Act. A respondent must be able to ascertain from the payment claim with completeness and certainty – at the time it receives the payment claim – each claim which it will have to address in its payment response if it chooses not to satisfy that claim. It must also be able to ascertain with completeness and clarity when it receives a payment claim the precise scope of the bar which will attach under s 15(3) if it chooses not to serve a payment response in accordance with the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the case before me, the applicant did not merely omit a claim from its payment claim. The applicant went further and expressly excluded the retention sum claim from its payment claim. That amounts to an unsolicited admission by the applicant that the sum was not due. Whatever the reason, the essential fact remains that the retention sum claim did not form part of the applicant’s payment claim. As a result, the applicant had no entitlement under s 12(2) of the Act to apply for the retention sum claim to be adjudicated upon. No payment claim dispute within the meaning of s 13(1) arose in connection with the retention sum claim, or could arise once the respondent failed to serve a payment response. The adjudicator was never clothed with the statutory power to deal with the retention sum claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The applicant argues that ss 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) or 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) empowered the adjudicator to adjudicate upon the retention sum claim. These provisions permit the adjudicator, in determining an adjudication application, to have regard to matters extraneous to the payment claim. The extraneous matters covered by these three subsections are, respectively: (i) the provisions of the contract to which the adjudication application relates; (ii) the adjudication application and the documents accompanying it; and (iii) any other matter which the adjudicator reasonably considers to be relevant to the adjudication. Thus, the applicant argues, the adjudicator was empowered by the Act to have regard to the following material in order to allow the retention sum claim: (i) the applicant’s s 13(2) notice – as a document accompanying the adjudication application – which invited the adjudicator to award the retention sum to the applicant; (ii) the parties’ contract, and the fact that it made no provision for a retention sum; and (iii) the applicant’s submissions on the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I cannot accept the applicant’s submission. It is no doubt true that s 17(3) of the Act empowers the adjudicator to have regard to the matters extraneous to the payment claim which are set out in s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">h</span>), including the three specific matters on which the applicant relies. But the adjudicator’s powers under s 17(3) do not arise in a vacuum. Section 17(3) rests on the fundamental underlying premise that the adjudicator is exercising those powers to determine a payment claim dispute within the meaning of s 13(1) which is properly part of the subject-matter of an adjudication application made by a claimant entitled to do so under s 12(2) of the Act. Where that fundamental underlying premise is false, s 17 does not permit him to determine that dispute. An adjudicator is not properly seised of a payment claim dispute under the Act if the dispute does not arise from the payment claim read together with any payment response: <span class="font-italic">Libra</span> ([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [96]. That was precisely the position of the retention sum claim in this adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The adjudicator adjudicated upon the retention sum claim when he was not clothed with the statutory authority to do so. The result is that that determination is null and void (<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [66]). The next question is whether it is the entirety of the determination which is null and void or whether the adjudicator’s determination on the retention sum claim can be severed from the remainder of his determination and annulled without affecting the interim finality attached to the remainder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I consider that question after dealing with the respondent’s natural justice ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Third ground: breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 As an alternative to its second ground, the respondent submits that the adjudicator breached his obligation under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to comply with the principles of natural justice because he adjudicated upon the retention sum claim while barring the respondent from being heard on that claim.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Respondent’s submissions dated 27 June 2016 at paragraphs 226 to 227.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is not in dispute that the adjudicator did bar the respondent from raising any reasons to justify withholding payment to the applicant on progress claim 24, including any reasons to justify withholding the retention sum, on the basis that it had failed to serve a payment response and was therefore subject to the bar in s 15(3) of the Act. For the reasons which follow, however, it is not necessary to analyse the respondent’s third ground in detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I have upheld the respondent’s second ground and found that the adjudicator was not clothed with the statutory authority to adjudicate upon the retention sum claim. If I am right in that, no question of natural justice arises. The successful jurisdictional challenge wholly overshadows the natural justice challenge. It makes no sense to ask, let alone to decide, whether the adjudicator breached the rules of natural justice in determining a claim which he had no statutory authority to determine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 If I am wrong in my holding, and the adjudicator <span class="font-italic">was</span> clothed with the statutory authority to adjudicate upon the retention sum claim, then the bar in s 15(3) is a complete answer to the respondent’s natural justice ground. The Act requires a respondent who intends to advance reasons for withholding payment in response to a valid payment claim to set those reasons out in a payment response served within the prescribed time. If a respondent fails to do that – either by omitting a particular reason from its payment response or by failing to serve a payment response at all – the bar in s 15(3) will operate not only to prevent the respondent from advancing those omitted reasons but also to curtail the adjudicator’s jurisdiction even to consider any such reasons (see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 at [33] – [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 To the extent that the respondent argues that this would be a result unfair to respondents as a class, I have accepted that argument in my holding that s 13(1) must be construed as precluding a claimant from adding to its claim for payment after it has served its payment claim (see [102] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For these reasons, it is my view that the respondent’s third ground adds nothing to its second ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The proper order to be made: severance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The result of my findings at this point in the analysis is that the adjudicator had the statutory authority to adjudicate upon the applicant’s payment claim but had no authority at all to adjudicate upon the applicant’s retention sum claim, that claim being outside its payment claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 That error is a jurisdictional error, not an error within jurisdiction. While it is certainly true that the adjudicator failed to comply with s 17(3) of the Act, that is not the gravamen of his error. His breach of s 17(3) did not come in the course of determining a claim which was properly before him. The gravamen of his error is that he purported to determine a claim which was never in law before him. His failure to comply with s 17(3) came in the course of committing the far more fundamental jurisdictional error and is wholly subsumed within it. In relation to the retention sum claim, therefore, the adjudicator committed an error of the first type in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span>, not of the second type (see [59] above). Nullity must therefore the consequence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The question then is whether it is only the adjudicator’s determination of the retention sum claim which is a nullity or whether his entire determination is a nullity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The respondent submits that I have no power to do anything but set aside the entire determination as a nullity. Relying on Australian authority from NSW, Queensland and Western Australia, the respondent argues that an adjudicator has a statutory duty to determine the amount which a respondent is to pay to a claimant. If he falls into jurisdictional error in determining any component of that amount, the entire determination is tainted and cannot stand. That is so even if that component is a severable part of the determination and the remainder of the determination is untainted by error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In response, the applicant’s primary submission is that I have a discretion to withhold the remedy of a setting aside order and that I should on the facts of this case exercise that discretion to uphold the entire determination, including the determination on the retention sum claim. I reject that submission. I start by accepting that such a discretion exists, while pointing out that it is to be exercised only rarely. In <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster</span><span class="font-italic"> Bar Pty Ltd v Hamo Industries Pty Ltd </span>[2010] NSWCA 190 (“<span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster</span>”), McDougall J referred to the relevant decisions in NSW and the Australian High Court and confirmed that the discretion extends at common law to permit a court to decline the remedy of <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> sought to quash a decision tainted with jurisdictional error in extraordinary cases (at [275]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To my mind, the decisions to which I have referred support the proposition that there remains a residual discretion not to grant <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> … even in a case of clear jurisdictional error. I have no doubt that, in the ordinary case, an order would be made “almost as of right”. But to state the position thus is not to deny but, rather, to affirm the discretion, in an extraordinary case, not to make the order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I do not consider it appropriate, on the facts of this case, to exercise the discretion and uphold the entire determination. I bear in mind the fundamental jurisdictional nature of the error. I also bear in mind that the amount involved in that error – $37,000 – is not on any view <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The applicant’s alternative submission, relying on English authority, is that an adjudication determination is severable. I therefore have the power to sever and set aside only that part of the determination which I have found to be a nullity due to jurisdictional error. The remainder of the determination, being untainted by error, will stand and continue to carry interim finality.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Applicant’s submissions dated 24 June 2016 at paragraph 70.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For the reasons which follow, I have accepted that alternative submission. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> The position under the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 My starting point is that the power to set aside an adjudication determination is a common law power which exists outside the Act. The Act brings into effect an entirely new and bespoke adjudication regime. To that end, it makes detailed statutory provision for every aspect of that regime from creating a new statutory entitlement to a progress payment in s 5 to setting out a statutory right to enforce an adjudication determination as a judgment of the court in s 27. But nowhere in the Act does it create a power to set aside an adjudication determination, let alone define the grounds on which that power ought to be exercised. There is thus no provision in the Act equivalent to s 48 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) or to article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration read with s 24 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed). The power to set aside an adjudication determination is not part of the bespoke adjudication regime created by the Act. It is created by and regulated by the common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In <span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 797 (“<span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span>”) the Court of Appeal confirmed that the power to set aside an adjudication determination is a common law power.  It is an aspect of the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span> the inherent power at common law of a superior court “to review the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts and tribunals or other public bodies discharging public functions” (see at [42]). The Court of Appeal also confirmed in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> that an application to set aside an adjudication determination is <span class="font-italic">akin</span> to judicial review and that the remedy for a successful challenger is <span class="font-italic">akin</span> to a quashing order (at [50]). A quashing order is, of course, the current name for the ancient prerogative writ of <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The applicant submits that a superior court has the power at common law to grant <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span>, not only against the whole of an inferior tribunal’s decision, but also against a severable part of that decision. By analogy therefore, and on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([120] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the High Court has the power to set aside an adjudication determination either in its entirety or in a severable part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The applicant cites two authorities for that proposition. The first is the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Director of Public Prosecutions v Hutchinson</span> [1990] 2 AC 783 (“<span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>”), a criminal law case which turned on administrative law principles. The second is a decision of Akenhead J at first instance in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon Limited v Urvasco Limited</span> [2008] BLR 250 (“<span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span>”), a security of payment case under the English scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I now analyse each of the two cases relied upon by the applicant in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The English approach</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The applicant relies on <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>to argue that, at common law, a court before which a measure is successfully challenged in part need not quash the entire measure but may sever and quash only its offending part while upholding the remainder of the measure as valid and subsisting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The actual question before the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was whether certain subsidiary legislation which the House had found to be <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> in part and <span class="font-italic">intra vires</span> in part was severable so as to support the defendants’ convictions of criminal offences under the part that was <span class="font-italic">intra vires</span>. The House of Lords held unanimously that there was a power at common law to sever and annul in part. On the facts, however, the House of Lords held unanimously that the subsidiary legislation in question did not come within the principles on which that power could be exercised. The defendants’ convictions were therefore quashed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Lord Bridge delivered the leading speech. He held that the test of severance at common law is a double test comprising textual severability and substantial severability. He defined each aspect of the double test as follows (at 804):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is involved is in truth a double test. I shall refer to the two aspects of the test as textual severability and substantial severability. A legislative instrument is textually severable if a clause, a sentence, a phrase or a single word may be disregarded, as exceeding the law-maker's power, and what remains of the text is still grammatical and coherent. A legislative instrument is substantially severable if the substance of what remains after severance is essentially unchanged in its legislative purpose, operation and effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Although the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was unanimous in the result, the law lords divided on the principles on which the power to sever could be exercised at common law. The division was between Lord Bridge for the majority and Lord Lowry in the minority. The issue which divided them was whether it is possible to modify the text of the measure in question in order to achieve severance when textual severance proves impossible. Lord Bridge’s view (at 811) was that textual modification is possible, so long as it leaves unaltered the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned measure:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When textual severance is possible, the test of substantial severability will be satisfied when the valid text is unaffected by, and independent of, the invalid. The law which the court may then uphold and enforce is the very law which the legislator has enacted, not a different law. But when the court must modify the text in order to achieve severance, this can only be done when the court is satisfied that it is effecting no change in the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Lord Lowry’s view (at 818) was that textual modification could not be used to achieve substantial severability. In other words, there could be no severance without textual severance:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My Lords, the accepted view in the common law jurisdictions has been that, when construing legislation the validity of which is under challenge, the first duty of the court, in obedience to the principle that a law should, whenever possible, be interpreted <span class="font-italic">ut res magis valeat quam pereat</span>, is to see whether the impugned provision can reasonably bear a construction which renders it valid. Failing that, the court's duty … is to decide whether the whole [of]… the challenged legislation or only part of it must be held invalid and ineffective. That problem has traditionally be resolved by applying first the textual, and then the substantial, severability test. If the legislation failed the first test, it was condemned in its entirety. If it passed that test, it had to face the next hurdle. This approach, in my opinion, has a great deal in its favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Lord Bridge’s approach gained the agreement of all the law lords save for Lord Lowry. It was also adopted and applied by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Commissioner of Police v Davis</span> [1994] 1 AC 283 at 298 to 299 per Lord Goff. I therefore take Lord Bridge’s approach as correctly expressing the common law position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is not, of course, directly applicable to the case before me. It analyses the severability of delegated legislation in administrative law. It does not analyse a superior court’s inherent supervisory power to quash the decision of an inferior tribunal. But my function in exercising that power is analogous to the House of Lords’ function in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>. As in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>, I have to determine the consequence which should properly follow when a decision-maker exercises a power which Parliament has delegated to it contrary to Parliament’s intent in one respect and in accordance with that intent in another respect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Further, the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not see a conceptual distinction between severance when striking down subsidiary legislation in part and severance when quashing the decision of an inferior tribunal in part. Thus, Lord Lowry cited (at 815) with approval the decision of McNeill J in <span class="font-italic">R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Greater London Council</span> [1986] QB 556 (“<span class="font-italic">ex parte GLC</span>”). That case establishes (at 581) that the remedies of both declaration and <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> are available to quash an unlawful and divisible part of an order or decision while upholding the remainder. What precisely is a divisible – and therefore severable – part of that order or decision is left to be determined in English law on the principles in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The common law power of severance which the House of Lords recognised in the field of administrative law in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is in fact a power which runs through the common law as a whole. In <span class="font-italic">Gantley Pty Ltd v Phoenix International Group Pty Ltd</span> [2010] VSC 106 (“<span class="font-italic">Gantley”</span>), Vickery J in the Supreme Court of Victoria had to consider whether a payment claim served under the Victorian security of payment legislation was severable. He held that it was, taking the view (at [101] – [104]) that <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> was merely one aspect of a general common law doctrine of severance:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The approach of Lord Bridge [in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>] is analogous to the principle of severance which applies in other areas of the common law. For example, under a contract where a term or part of a contract is uncertain, severance may be ordered if it does not result in materially altering the nature of the bargain which the parties have struck. Further, in relation to a will, part of which has been induced by undue influence, the offending part may be severed from the remainder if it does not materially alter the meaning of what remains. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>read with <span class="font-italic">ex parte GLC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([131] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">Gantley</span> ([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> ([120] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>suffices as authority for the proposition that the High Court hearing an application to set aside an adjudication determination issued under the Act has the power to quash the determination in part, provided that the part to be quashed meets Lord Bridge’s test of severability in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The respondent submits that <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in two decisions of the Court of Appeal preclude me from equating the power to set aside an adjudication determination to a writ of <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span>.

Our Court of Appeal was therefore making the simple and indisputable point at [51] of <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that it was not similarly compelled by a constitutional argument to reject <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> and adopt <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster</span> in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is most certainly not authority that the common law principles which govern <span class="font-italic">certiorari </span>have no application to the power to set aside an adjudication determination which is akin to <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span>. No doubt the two bodies of principles are not necessarily identical. And no doubt the two bodies may well develop in future along different lines at common law. But <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> is not authority that the two bodies have nothing at all in common. The principles which they have in common include the doctrine of severance and the discretion to withhold its grant in an extraordinary case where there is an equally effective and convenient alternative remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The respondent has also misconstrued <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([120] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The point made by the Court of Appeal at [50] in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> is that the Act and the subsidiary legislation made to support it – including s 27 of the Act and O 95 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) – have modified the <span class="font-italic">procedure</span> by which the High Court’s supervisory power is invoked to set aside an adjudication determination. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> said nothing about the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of that power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The view I have taken of the power to set aside a determination is neither endorsed nor contradicted directly by anything in the Act or in the case law interpreting and applying the Act. There is nothing in the Act or the case law which requires a court to exercise its power to set aside a determination by setting aside the entire determination. Equally, there is nothing in the Act or the case law which prohibits a court from setting aside a part of a determination which it finds to be severable. That is not surprising. As I have already mentioned, the Act makes no attempt to describe, prescribe or circumscribe in any respect the content of the court’s power to set aside an adjudication determination. And the question of severability has not been considered in any case law under the Act to date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Given that the Act has left setting aside to the common law, and given that <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span> ([120] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) do not exclude the operation of the common law doctrine of severance in exercising the power to set aside, it appears to me that it is entirely appropriate that that power should be exercisable against a severable part of an adjudication determination. The doctrine of severance is based on the principle of <span class="font-italic">ut res magis valeat quam pereat</span>. Applying that principle to an adjudication determination permits the court to give the maximum effect permitted by law to an adjudication determination, and thereby to advance the purposes of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The second case on which the applicant relies to argue that an adjudication determination can be set aside in part is the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Akenhead J concluded in that case, albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that an adjudicator’s decision under the English security of payment scheme was severable, but only along the same lines, and to the same extent, as the disputes before the adjudicator were several. Akenhead J formulated (at [63]) the following six principles of severability under the English security of payment scheme:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step must be to ascertain what dispute or disputes has or have been referred to adjudication.

If there is no objection to that by the other party or if the contract permits it, the adjudicator will have to resolve all referred disputes and differences. If there is objection, the adjudicator can only proceed with resolving more than one dispute or difference if the contract permits him to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the decision properly addresses more than one dispute or difference, a successful jurisdictional challenge on that part of the decision which deals with one such dispute or difference will not undermine the validity and enforceability of that part of the decision which deals with the other(s).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The same in logic must apply to the case where there is a non-compliance with the rules of natural justice which only affects the disposal of one dispute or difference.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) There is a proviso to (c) and (d) above which is that, if the decision as drafted is simply not severable in practice, for instance on the wording, or if the breach of the rules of natural justice is so severe or all pervading that the remainder of the decision is tainted, the decision will not be enforced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) In all cases where there is a decision on one dispute or difference, and the adjudicator acts, materially, in excess of jurisdiction or in breach of the rules of natural justice, the decision will not be enforced by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I will refer to these principles as <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles (a) to (f).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The respondent submits that I cannot adopt and apply the approach in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> because the juridical basis of adjudication in England is different from that in Singapore

</div>
</div>. I accept that distinction, of course. As I have already pointed out and accepted, the juridical basis of adjudication in England is the parties’ agreement whereas the juridical basis of adjudication in Singapore is statute. But that distinction in my view assists the applicant rather than the respondent. It explains why <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles (a) to (f) turn on the distinction between a single-dispute adjudication and a multiple-dispute adjudication rather than on <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> severability, without in any way detracting from the availability of <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> severability in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I begin by observing that <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (e) is the analogue of <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span><span class="font-italic">’s</span> test of textual severability. But principles (c), (d) and (f) are not analogues of substantial severability. Instead, those principles make severability turn entirely on the distinction between a one-dispute adjudication and a multiple-dispute adjudication. That distinction is artificial. But that distinction is also necessary because adjudication in English law is founded on the parties’ agreement – express, implied or imputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The modification is artificial because it makes severance on <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles (c), (d) and (f) available only in a multiple-dispute adjudication. But every dispute comprises a cascade of sub-disputes. Whether a claimant has referred to adjudication one indivisible dispute made up of sub-disputes or several distinct and divisible disputes is a question which depends in large part, if not entirely, on the level of generality with which one undertakes the inquiry necessary to answer it. There is therefore a real risk of artifice in the <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> approach: the answer will always be in the eye of the beholder. To that extent, <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles (c), (d) and (f) could be said to be artificial in that they elevate form over substance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 But this artificial distinction is entirely necessary in English law. The parties’ agreement is the sole basis for attaching interim finality to an adjudicator’s decision and for enforcing that finality by entering summary judgment on the decision. The parties’ agreement is therefore the only basis on which to justify attaching interim finality to part only of an adjudicator’s decision and then enforcing that finality by entering summary judgment for that part. In other words, it is impossible to effect severance in English law without undermining interim finality and enforceability unless it is possible at the same time to separate the parties’ agreement to interim finality and enforceability. The parties’ agreement can be separated only where the disputes can be separated. It is for that reason that Akenhead J was compelled to hold in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a court can cleave an adjudicator’s decision in English law only along the same lines and to the same extent as it can cleave the disputes before the adjudicator. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The English approach after Cantillon</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The English cases which have come after <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>have recognised to a certain extent the artificiality inherent in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles (c), (d) and (f). They have begun by recognising that <span class="font-italic">Ca</span><span class="font-italic">ntillon</span> principle (f) is not absolute and that even a decision on a one-dispute adjudication may be severed.

The adjudicator took all 12 items into account in his decision in the adjudication. Akenhead J, hearing the claimant’s application to enforce the decision, held that the adjudicator had rightly taken 10 of those items into account but had committed a jurisdictional error in taking the remaining two into account. <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (e) was satisfied. But principle (f) was not, because only one dispute had been referred to the adjudicator. Akenhead J nevertheless severed the part of the decision tainted by the adjudicator’s error and allowed the claimant’s application to enforce the remainder. Akenhead J did not, however, make clear how severance on these facts could be reconciled with <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150  <span class="font-italic">Lidl</span> ([147]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>) was again a one-dispute adjudication. A claimant referred a dispute over liquidated and ascertained damages to adjudication. It was common ground before Edwards-Stuart J that the adjudicator had exceeded his jurisdiction by answering a question on liquidated damages which was not put to him. The claimant argued that it was nevertheless entitled to enforce the adjudicator’s decision on the basis that that part of the decision could be severed. The respondent relied on <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f) to argue that the adjudicator’s decision was entirely unenforceable because the claimant had referred only one dispute – a dispute over liquidated damages – to adjudication. Edwards-Stuart J rejected this argument, severed the adjudication decision and permitted the claimant to enforce that part of the decision unaffected by error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Edwards-Stuart J expressly acknowledged in <span class="font-italic">Lidl</span> ([147]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>) that <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f) is not absolute. Where an adjudicator exceeds his jurisdiction by deciding a matter which the parties have not referred to him, severance is permissible by way of exception to <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f), so long as <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (e) is satisfied (at [61]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… At first sight it may appear that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Greencoat</span> conflicts with the general principle that a decision cannot be severed where only one dispute or difference has been referred. The rationale underlying this principle is, I think, that where a single dispute or difference has been referred it will generally be difficult to show that the reasoning in relation to the part of the decision that it is being sought to sever had no impact on the reasoning leading to the decision actually reached, or that the actual outcome would still have been the same. If this is the case, the part cannot safely be severed from the whole. However, where, in the case of the referral of a single dispute additional questions are brought in and adjudicated upon, whether by oversight or error, there should be no reason in principle why any decision on those additional questions should not be severed provided that the reasoning giving rise to it does not form an integral part of the decision as a whole.

</div> which influenced Akenhead J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span>. In his later article, the author concludes that <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f) is no longer absolute. He therefore proposes to reformulate as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) An adjudicator’s decision on a single dispute, partly made without jurisdiction, may be severed so as to give effect to the part of the decision made within jurisdiction provided that the remaining valid part of the decision may be identified in terms of liability and quantum, without adjustment or contribution to the content of the valid part by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 This formulation comes very close to approximating Lord Bridge’s test of substantial severability in <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> (see [126] above), with its language adapted to the specialised field of adjudication. However, even with this proposed revision, the <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principles still rest on the distinction between a one-dispute adjudication and a multiple-dispute adjudication. For that reason, even the proposed revision to <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f) restricts itself to jurisdictional error. If the domain of principle (f) is confined to the one-dispute adjudication, then it is axiomatic that a breach of natural justice would undermine the validity of the entirety of the adjudicator’s decision on that single dispute. It is for that reason that <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> principle (f) does not attempt to accommodate a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Singapore approach</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Synthesising a principle for jurisdictional error</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The power to set aside an adjudication determination in part under our security of payment scheme is no more than the court’s common law power to quash the decision of an inferior tribunal in part. In applying that power to the specialised field of adjudication in Singapore, it is not necessary to draw an artificial distinction between a one-dispute adjudication and a multiple-dispute adjudication in order to have a juridical basis for attaching interim finality and enforceability to the remaining part which is upheld. Both of those consequences result in Singapore from the force of statute, not the agreement of the parties. Those two consequences continue to attach by force of statute even if a determination is set aside in part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 It appears to me, therefore, that an adjudication determination under the Act is severable for jurisdictional error on the following principles, drawing on both <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and adapted to the local context:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court may set aside a severable part of an adjudication determination (what is a severable part being ascertained in accordance with paragraphs (b) to (d) below) for jurisdictional error without undermining by that act alone the interim finality and enforceability of the remainder of the determination under the Act.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Subject to paragraph (e) below, a part of a determination is severable for jurisdictional error only if it is both textually severable and substantially severable from the remainder of the determination. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A part of a determination is textually severable if the textual elements of the adjudicator’s determination on that part, including his reasons in writing supporting that part given under s 17(2) read with s 16(8) of the Act, may be disregarded, with what remains of the adjudicator’s reasons still being grammatical and coherent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A part of a determination is substantially severable if the remainder of the determination which is to be upheld as valid and which is to carry interim finality and be enforced may be identified in terms of liability and quantum, without adjustment or contribution to the content of the valid part by the court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) By way of exception to paragraphs (c) and (d) above, the court may modify the text of the adjudicator’s determination in order to achieve severance if the court is satisfied that it is effecting no change in the substantial effect of the adjudication determination after accounting for the jurisdictional error and its necessary editorial consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I have accommodated in these principles only a challenge which succeeds for jurisdictional error.

But identifying when that can occur is unnecessary for my decision and is best done when the issue actually arises for decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The respondent submits strenuously that by severing an adjudication determination on these principles, I am guilty of judicial legislation. I do not accept that characterisation. As I have held, the Act leaves the content of the power to set aside an adjudication determination entirely to the common law. At common law, the power to quash includes a power to quash in part. No parliamentary legislation is required to create that power. No judicial legislation is involved in recognising and applying it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The retention sum claim is severable on this principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Applying the principles at [155] above to the case before me, it seems to me that the adjudicator’s determination on the retention sum claim is both textually severable and substantially severable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The adjudication determination is textually severable because the adjudicator gave his reasons for allowing the retention sum claim in only two paragraphs of his determination and nowhere else.

That figure is the sum of the principal value of the payment claim ($342,530.80) plus the value of the retention sum claim ($37,000). In that same paragraph, the adjudicator certifies the adjudicated amount to be $406,097.96, being the composite figure of $379,530.80 with goods and services tax added to it at 7%. This adjudicated amount also appears in paragraph 3.1 of the determination. I cannot textually sever these figures in these two paragraphs of the determination without disposing of the entire adjudicated amount and discarding the essential content of the determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I am satisfied, however, that the principle at [155(e)] above permits me to substitute the figure $342,530.80 for $379,530.80 in paragraph 37; and, having added goods and services tax of 7% to this smaller figure, to substitute the figure $366,507.96 for $406,097.96 in both paragraphs 3.1 and 37 as the adjudicated amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The adjudication determination is also substantially severable. It is not mere happenstance that the adjudicator’s decision on the retention sum claim is textually severable. The content of the applicant’s payment claim and the content of the retention sum claim are entirely separate and involve separate considerations of fact and law. With respect to the applicant’s payment claim, the adjudicator considered whether the works carried out by the applicant justified the payment claim. With respect to the retention sum claim, the adjudicator considered whether the parties had contractually agreed that the respondent was to withhold a retention sum.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> LHW Affidavit (dated 5 April 2016) at page 43 (the determination at page 12).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The adjudicator’s decision on the retention sum can be severed from the remainder of the determination without any interference with his determination on the applicant’s payment claim and without the court adjusting to or contributing to the content of the valid part of the determination apart from, as I have mentioned, the arithmetical consequences of the jurisdictional error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The effect of severance is to quash the adjudicator’s determination on the retention sum claim and to uphold the remainder of the determination as being valid and as carrying interim finality. That remainder can be identified easily and with certainty both in terms of liability and quantum. Liability remains with the respondent despite severance. For the reasons I have given above, the quantum of the remaining claim is precisely $366,507.96, including goods and services tax.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In addition to awarding the adjudicated amount to the applicant, the adjudicator also awarded interest on the adjudicated amount and the costs of the adjudication to the applicant. The interest component poses no impediment to severance. The adjudicator awarded interest which accrues at 5.33% on the adjudicated amount on and from 14 February 2016. The editorial change to the adjudicated amount automatically changes the principal on which interest accrues without need for further editorial change.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 As for the costs award, there is no difficulty in satisfying substantial severability on the liability for costs. The adjudicator awarded the entire costs of the adjudication to the applicant. Those costs comprise $600 as the authorised nominating body’s fee and $4,800 as his own fees. The respondent did not file a payment response and therefore was rightly barred under s 15(3) from advancing any reasons against payment, both in respect of the payment claim and in respect of the retention sum claim. As a result, it is possible to say with certainty that the applicant: (i) would have been entirely successful even if the applicant had not invited the adjudicator to determine the retention sum claim; and (ii) remains entirely successful even after severance. Severance does not require any editorial adjustment to the respondent’s liability for costs. Even if it were to appear to me that an adjustment was necessary because, hypothetically, the adjudicator had apportioned the costs between the parties in his determination and that apportionment could no longer stand after the severable part had been set aside, that erroneous apportionment would have been in my view an error by the adjudicator within his jurisdiction rather than a jurisdictional error. Even on that hypothesis, therefore, that error would not have entailed setting aside either the costs award or the entire determination on the principles in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> ([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and would have been no impediment to severance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Substantial severability on the quantum of costs is slightly more difficult. The award of the authorised nominating body’s fee does not in itself pose a difficulty. That is a fixed fee of $600. It would have been the same fixed fee even if the adjudicator had not fallen into jurisdictional error. The quantum of this element of costs is therefore unaffected by the severance. The difficulty lies in the adjudicator’s fees. Those fees are fixed at $300 per hour. Although that is subject to a statutory maximum, that maximum was not in any event reached in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The adjudicator’s fees of $4,800 therefore represent 16 hours of the adjudicator’s time-costs. I cannot tell how many of those 16 hours the adjudicator spent adjudicating upon the payment claim and how many he spent adjudicating upon the retention sum claim. But it seems to me that, to the extent that an adjudicator includes in his determination of the costs payable by a respondent to him in an adjudication an element of his own time-costs for determining a part of the claim while labouring under a jurisdictional error, his determination on the quantum of costs is not liable to be set aside if his determination of that part is set aside as a result of that jurisdictional error. I say that for two alternative reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 First, it appears to me that an adjudicator’s error in including an element of improperly incurred time-costs in his determination of his own fees in an adjudication is once again an error within his jurisdiction. There is no indication in the Act that its legislative purpose is to invalidate either the costs aspect of the determination or the entire determination as a result of such an error (see <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> [42] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [66] – [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Alternatively, if I am wrong on that, and there was jurisdictional error in relation to the determination on costs, I would hold on the facts of this case that this is an appropriate case in which to exercise the court’s discretion to withhold the remedy of a setting aside order in relation to the costs determination. The sum in question is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>, being a relatively small proportion of the $4,800 in fees which is in turn a relatively small proportion of the total value of the adjudication amount, whether before or after severance. And there is an alternative remedy which is adequate and appropriate, bearing in mind the quantum involved, which is to leave it to the respondent to recover any overpayment on fees as damages in arbitration or litigation brought by it to determine with full finality the parties’ rights and liabilities arising from their disputes comprised in this adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 For these reasons, there is no need to make any editorial adjustment to the costs element of the determination in order to achieve substantial severance of the retention sum claim. The costs element of the determination is to stand as determined by the adjudicator, both as to liability and quantum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Australian approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The respondent argues that my approach to severance is heterodox and urges me to adopt instead the approach taken in the Australian cases. The submission is that the Australian cases are of more persuasive authority than the English cases because the various Australian state jurisdictions, like Singapore, have a security of payment scheme which is statutory rather than one based on the parties’ agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The respondent submits that the effect of the Australian cases is to establish that, in a jurisdiction which has enacted a statutory security of payment scheme, an adjudication determination is not severable unless there is specific statutory authority permitting severance. There is specific statutory authority only in the Victorian and in the Queensland security of payment legislation. More specifically, the NSW security of payment legislation – which served as a model for our own legislation – has no such statutory authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The Australian cases on which the respondent relies, in chronological order, are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the NSW cases of <span class="font-italic">Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd v Luikens</span> [2003] NSWSC 1140 (“<span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>”),

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I have considered each of these cases. None of them is authority contrary to the position which I have taken on severability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 I make three overarching points which touch on the decisions in all of these cases before I consider each case in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The first overarching point I make is that in none of these cases did the claimant argue that the power at common law to quash a decision of an inferior tribunal in part could be exercised to quash an adjudicator’s determination in part. None of these case therefore considered – let alone rejected – the very point which the claimant canvasses before me and which I have accepted. To that extent, therefore, none of these cases is even persuasive authority that the common law power to quash in part does not apply to the court’s power to set aside an adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The second overarching point is that none of these Australian cases contemplates a situation such as the present, where an adjudicator exceeds his jurisdiction by determining a claim which he had no statutory authority whatsoever to determine. That was precisely the scenario which the English court had to consider in <span class="font-italic">Greencoat</span> ([147]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Lidl</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([147]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>). That is the type of case in which severance poses the least conceptual difficulty. For that reason, I consider the English approach to be more persuasive. I do not consider that purposes of the Act are advanced by denying outright any power to sever even in the straightforward case – such as a case involving a clear jurisdictional error like the one before me – simply because severance will be difficult and may be impossible in more complex cases. I consider that the purposes of the Act are advanced by recognising the common law doctrine of severance as applying to any application to set aside an adjudication determinations for jurisdictional error, subject to satisfying the tests of textual severability and substantial severability which have been set out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The third overarching point is related to the first two. Each of these Australian cases proceeds on the assumption that – because adjudication is a creature of statute – a power to quash an adjudication determination in part must also be created by statute. That argument from statute has been addressed in the case before me by my finding that our power under our Act to set aside an adjudication determination is not a creature of statute at all; and also by my acceptance of the authority of <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Cantillon</span> ([122] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In my view, Vickery J in <span class="font-italic">Gantley</span> ([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) took the correct approach to the question, albeit in the context of a payment claim rather than an adjudication determination. He too was presented with a submission that the court had no power to sever a payment claim because the Victorian security of payment legislation did not permit it.

The question should be whether the Act, either expressly or impliedly, operates to exclude the common law doctrine of severance. I find that it does not.

</div> of the Victorian security of payment legislation contains an express power to permit a court to set aside an adjudication determination in part, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span> “to the extent that it has been made in contravention” of the Victorian equivalent of s 17(3) of the Act. That distinction is not, to my mind, to the point. The fact is that Vickery J held that the common law doctrine of severance applied to a payment claim because the Victorian legislation did not expressly or impliedly prohibit severance of a payment claim. So too, in the case before me, I have held that the common law doctrine of severance applies to an adjudication determination because the Act does not expressly or impliedly prohibit severance of an adjudication determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 I will now deal with each of the Australian cases in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Palmer J found that an adjudicator had made a jurisdictional error in relation to one item worth $99,609 in a determination worth over $529,000. He held, however, that the court had no power to dissect the adjudicated sum in order to quash the determination in part because arriving at the “adjudicated amount” was a duty imposed on the adjudicator by the NSW equivalent of s 17(2) of our Act (at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first point to note is that although the jurisdictional error in this case has affected only one disputed claim … the court cannot quash just the decision which affects [that claim], leaving the rest of the Determination intact. That is because the adjudication process is required by s 22(1) of the Act [<span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 17(2) of our Act] to produce only three findings: the adjudicated amount (if any), the date on which that amount becomes payable and the rate of interest payable. Only these findings are reflected in the adjudication certificate which is issued under s 24(3) of the Act and filed as a judgment under s 25(1). The adjudicator has no power to correct the adjudication amount where it is shown to have been produced by error of law, whether or not jurisdictional. There is power to correct a determination under s 22(5) only in accordance with what might loosely be called the ‘slip rule’. None of the circumstances provided in s 22(5) is applicable in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Having held that he had no power to sever the adjudication determination, however, Palmer J did not leave unresolved the practical problem which that finding gave rise to. He relied (at [94]) on the “well-established [principle] that relief in the nature of the prerogative writs may be withheld in the Court’s discretion if there is another ‘equally effective and convenient remedy’”. He declined, however, to exercise that discretion on the facts of the case because: (i) the amount in question was high, almost 20% of the total value of the determination; (ii) there was no evidence that the dispute was in the process of being resolved with full finality; and (iii) there was no evidence how long it would take for their dispute to be resolved with full finality. He accordingly quashed the determination in its entirety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 It appears to me, with respect, that the inevitable pragmatic difficulties which are posed by an adjudication determination which is valid in part and void in part are best resolved by accepting that the common law power to quash in part extends to adjudication determinations rather than by relying on the discretion to withhold the power to quash on the basis that there is an equally effective and convenient alternative remedy. Where an adjudication determination is void in part, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span> affected by the first type of error in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra)</span>, it would be an affront to the scheme of the Act to exercise a discretion to withhold an order confirming that part as being void by quashing it. But it would, in my view, be equally an affront to the scheme of the Act to quash even the valid parts of a severable determination when a power exists at common law to quash only a part of it and when there is nothing in the Act to exclude that power.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lanskey</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In <span class="font-italic">Lanskey</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), a claimant put forward a payment claim which was final in nature. It was therefore essential that the adjudicator ascertain the value of the work which the claimant had actually completed. The respondent advanced 69 deductions in response to the payment claim. The adjudicator mischaracterised all 69 of the deductions as being in the nature of a set-off for defective work. In fact, a number of the deductions were not for defective work but were for incomplete work. These deductions totalled in value A$12,435.39 out of the determination’s total value of A$145,849.90. As a result of his mischaracterisation, the adjudicator failed to determine the value of the work completed. This error led Associate Justice Macready to hold that the adjudicator had denied the respondent natural justice (at [15]) and had failed exercise his power <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> to determine the dispute before him (at [19]). The judge also held, following Palmer J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), that he had no power to sever the adjudication determination (at [20] – [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 <span class="font-italic">Lanskey</span> ([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) simply followed <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span> ([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) without adding to Palmer J’s analysis. For the same reason I have given above, and in light of the three overarching points I have made about all the Australian cases, I do not consider that <span class="font-italic">Lanskey</span> is authority against the approach I have taken in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Watpac</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In <span class="font-italic">Watpac</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), McDougall J quashed an adjudication determination in its entirety even though a breach of natural justice affected only a part of it. In the course of his judgment he said this (at [27] – [29]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[27] [Counsel for the respondent] referred also to the decision of the [NSW] Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd v Roads &amp; Traffic Authority of New South Wales</span> (2007) 23 BCL 205. The particular significance of that decision is that it supports the proposition that there is no concept in relation to determinations, of partial invalidity. … If it seems to me to follow from this that if a determination lacks some essential condition … then the consequences, of invalidity, follow.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[28] … On either basis [<span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span> if a statutory precondition of validity is not satisfied or if there has been a substantial denial of natural justice] there is lacking something essential to validity. On either basis, the resulting determination must be void. And what is void is the determination, not the particular part affected by the relevant invalidating circumstance. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[29] To put it another way: if the court were to strike down part only of the determination, it would be, in effect, rewriting it. That would usurp the function entrusted by the [NSW] Act to adjudicators. In addition, it may not always be obvious to see how a denial of natural justice has affected the outcome: for example, where the omitted or irrelevant matter had the capacity to [affect] … the adjudicator’s overall view of the “credibility” or substance of a party’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The key point about <span class="font-italic">Watpac</span> ([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is that it dealt with the difficult issue of a breach of natural justice. A breach of natural justice can be of many types and can have many consequences. Some breaches may affect the determination of every aspect of every dispute before the adjudicator. It must follow in such a case that the entire determination must to be set aside. Some breaches may affect only what is clearly a severable part of a determination. It suffices in such a case to sever and set aside only that part. Yet other breaches may affect a severable part of a determination but do so in a manner which suggests that the adjudicator misapprehended his entire task. It may follow, but not necessarily so, that the entire determination must be set aside. A further difficulty in analysing the difficulties in a breach of natural justice case is that the counterfactual analysis necessary to effect severance is far more complicated. That analysis carries a great risk of the court contributing to the content of the determination or of the court substituting its judgment for that of the adjudicator. It is for these reasons that I have left it to a case in which the issue actually arises for an error consisting of a breach of the rules of natural justice to be accommodated within the principles I have ventured to suggest at [155] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 A jurisdictional error is of an entirely different nature. A jurisdictional error is far more likely to result in nullifying or invalidating only a severable aspect of the determination. The jurisdictional error in the case before me illustrates this. The part of the determination which is affected by the error is severable both as to liability and quantum. The counterfactual is obvious beyond doubt. What the adjudicator’s determination would have been if he had not fallen into jurisdictional error can be ascertained with absolute certainty. There is no danger of the court substituting its own decision on the content of the dispute for the adjudicator’s determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 For all these reasons, therefore, it appears to me that <span class="font-italic">Watpac</span> ([173(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is not persuasive authority against the approach I have taken. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">James Trowse</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In <span class="font-italic">James Trowse</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), an adjudicator determined that a claimant was entitled to A$167,522.32. The respondent applied for judicial review of the determination alleging that the adjudicator had made a number of errors. Atkinson J held that the determination was unaffected by error save that the adjudicator had breached the rules of natural justice in awarding the claimant A$22,101 for a particular variation claim. As a result, she quashed the entire determination, holding (at [56]) that severance was not possible under the Queensland security of payment scheme. She relied on s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Queensland legislation – to the same effect for present purposes as s 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of our Act – to hold (at [57] – [59]) that the Queensland statute: (i) empowers and obliges the adjudicator to arrive at a single sum which by statute carries interim finality and bind the parties; and (ii) does not, in the absence of express statutory authority to that effect (as there was in Victoria), allow a Queensland court to dissect that sum:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[56] The Victorian [security of payments legislation] includes provisions not found in its interstate equivalents which may render the adjudicator’s decision partially void…. In the absence of any such provision, it is not possible to sever the adjudication determination. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[57] The statutory scheme in Queensland provides for an adjudication decision for one amount only. Pursuant to s 26 of [the Queensland legislation], an adjudicator is to decide the amount of the progress payment, if any, to be paid by the respondent to the claimant (the adjudicated amount) …. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[58] The adjudicated amount is a statutorily created sum that once determined is final and binding upon the parties. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[59] Save a slip rule, there is no mechanism available to sever any unlawful finding from an adjudicated amount, in particular a part of the adjudicated amount that is infected by jurisdictional error as found in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 I make only one point on <span class="font-italic">James Trowse</span> ([173(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in addition to my three overarching points. Atkinson J herself accepted (at [55]) that her all-or-nothing approach was “not necessarily an attractive result”. That is why, no doubt, the Queensland security of payment legislation was thereafter amended by introducing a new s 100(4) which expressly empowers a Queensland court to set aside an identifiable part of an adjudicator’s decision on grounds of jurisdictional error while allowing the part of the decision not affected by the error to remain binding on the parties. There appears to me to be no reason that Singapore law should countenance such an unattractive result and wait for legislative cure when the common law power to quash in part offers an immediate solution and is not prohibited by our Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">BM Alliance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The next case which the respondent relies on is the decision of Muir JA in the Queensland Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BM Alliance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). That was an appeal from a decision of Applegarth J at first instance (at [2013] QSC 67). In <span class="font-italic">BM Alliance</span>, a respondent applied for a declaration that an adjudication determination was void as a result of three jurisdictional errors. Applegarth J upheld only one of those three errors. That error affected a claim worth A$4.3m out of the total award of A$28m. Instead of declaring the entire determination void, however, Applegarth J accepted the claimant’s undertaking to repay the A$4.3m to the respondent as an adequate alternative remedy for the respondent. He therefore exercised his discretion to withhold <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> to declare the entire determination void. The respondent appealed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The Queensland Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and declared the entire determination to be void. Muir JA, giving the principal judgment, held that: (i) an administrative decision arrived at in jurisdictional error lacks legal foundation and has no legal effect whatsoever unless statute intends to the contrary (at [62] and [66]); (ii) there was no basis in the provisions of the Queensland statute or in its underlying purposes or policy to find such a contrary intent (at [68] and [76]); and (iii) the respondent therefore had a right to have the entire determination declared void and not just the A$4.3m tainted by jurisdictional error (at [77]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 <span class="font-italic">BM Alliance</span> ([173(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is not a decision on the applicability of severance to adjudication determinations. Applegarth J’s decision at first instance did not sever the adjudication determination. Nor did Muir JA on appeal hold that adjudication determinations are not severable. Instead, the case turned on whether it is appropriate to exercise the court’s discretion to withhold prerogative relief even though jurisdictional error has been established, on the grounds that there is a more convenient and satisfactory remedy available to the respondent. The decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal reaffirms that the remedy of <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> is to be withheld only in extraordinary cases. That is not the approach I have taken to the retention sum claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alliance Contracting </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In <span class="font-italic">Alliance Contracting</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([173(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), a claimant referred a number of disputes over variations to adjudication. The respondent raised a number of set-offs and cross-claims in its response. The adjudicator resolved the rival contentions and found that the net result was that the claimant owed the respondent the net sum of A$6.2m. But he held that he had no jurisdiction, on an adjudication commenced by a claimant, to award a sum <span class="font-italic">against</span> the claimant. He therefore determined merely that the claimant was not entitled to recover any sum from the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The respondent sought judicial review of the adjudicator’s determination. The respondent confined its challenge to the adjudicator’s determination that he had no jurisdiction to award a sum against the claimant. By doing that, the respondent sought to leave intact his determination that the claimant owed the respondent A$6.2m. Beech J in the Supreme Court of Western Australia held that: (i) the adjudicator was correct in determining that he had no power to award a sum against the claimant (at [75]); and (ii) that if the respondent were correct and the adjudicator had committed jurisdictional error, the entire determination would have to be quashed, there being no power to sever (at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 <span class="font-italic">Alliance Contracting</span> ([173(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) does not support the respondent’s submissions to me. First, Beech J dismissed the application because the adjudicator had not been guilty of any jurisdictional error. What he said about severance was clearly and merely <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. Second, what the respondent was trying to do in that case, rather audaciously, was not to sever the adjudicator’s decision along lines of divisible substance on the <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> principles. Instead, the respondent was attempting to sever and nullify the adjudicator’s reasoning on a single issue: whether he had the power to award a sum against the claimant. As Beech J himself said (at [91]) the power of severance does not allow a party to cherry-pick favourable findings <span class="font-italic">within</span> even a divisible part of an adjudication determination (at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, the adjudication cannot be divided into component steps in its reasoning, and one or more separate steps then impugned by judicial review. It is the adjudication that is liable to judicial review, not elements of the reasoning adopted in the adjudication. If the adjudicator made the jurisdictional error alleged by [the respondent], the adjudication is liable to be quashed. The substance of what is sought by [the respondent] is to preserve the whole of the adjudication, except for the adjudicator’s conclusion that he had no power to award a sum in favour of [the respondent]. I am not persuaded that it would be open to grant the relief sought by [the respondent]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Australian authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 For the reasons I have given, I do not find the respondent’s submissions based on the Australian authorities to be persuasive. There is nothing in the Australian cases which demonstrates to me that I do not have the power to sever the determination or that I should not exercise the power to order that the determination be set aside in part, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span> to the extent of the retention sum of $37,000 plus $2,590 goods and services tax, and upheld as to the remainder.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I conclude by repeating and summarising my holdings and findings. The applicant’s payment claim was based on a single contract. The adjudicator did not act in excess of jurisdiction in determining the payment claim. But the retention sum claim was not part of the payment claim. The adjudicator therefore exceeded his jurisdiction in purporting to determine the retention sum claim. That is an error of the first type in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra)</span>. That aspect of the determination is therefore a nullity. I have declined to permit the entire determination to stand by exercising my discretion to withhold the remedy of setting aside. But I do have the power to set aside a severable part of the determination rather than the entire determination. The determination of the retention sum claim is a severable part of the determination. It is both textually severable and substantially severable. Although some editorial adjustments are necessary to carry through the arithmetical consequences of the severance, those adjustments are permissible and do not detract from severability. I have therefore exercised the power to sever in order to set aside that part – and only that part – of the determination, comprising $37,000 plus $2,590 in goods and services tax. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 The applicant is entitled to the costs of this application. The respondent has failed in its attempt to set aside the determination in its entirety. Although the applicant too has not succeeded in its primary submission that I should uphold the determination in its entirety, it has succeeded in its alternative submission that the adjudicator’s determination of the retention sum claim should be severed and that part set aside alone. It is also fair to say that the applicant did not press its primary submission with great enthusiasm. I therefore consider the event on this application to be in the applicant’s favour without qualification. Costs must follow that event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 I have therefore ordered that the respondent pay to the applicant the costs of and incidental to this application, such costs fixed at $8,000 plus reasonable disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The applicant is entitled to have released to it the sum of money which the respondent paid into court as security under s 27(5) of the Act. However, in ordering the release of that sum, I must reflect my decision to set aside the determination to the extent of the retention sum claim. The sum paid by the respondent into court has an element of post-determination interest calculated in accordance with the adjudicator’s determination. I cannot, therefore, simply order that the Accountant General release $37,000, with or without goods and services tax, to the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The retention sum claim ($37,000) represents 9.749% of the adjudicated amount ($379,539.80). I have therefore ordered the Accountant General to release to the respondent 9.749% of the sum which the respondent paid into court together with the further interest accrued on that part of the money while it has been held by the Accountant General. The balance of the sum paid into court by the respondent together with the further interest accrued on it must be released to the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Koh, Poonaam Bai, and Lorenda Lee (Eldan Law LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Tan Tian Luh and Ngo Wei Shing (Chancery Law Corporation) for the respondent.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
