<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Chan Pui Woo Teresa (“Teresa”),
                    who is the plaintiff in this suit, was the unfortunate victim of an advance fee
                    fraud, more commonly known as the “419 fraud” or “Nigerian
                    scam”. She sued Ng Fook Khau Michael (“Michael”) who is the
                    first defendant, and her former colleague Jonathan Tan See Leh
                    (“Jonathan”) who is the second defendant, holding them responsible
                    for the money she lost as a result of the fraud. Advance fee fraud comes in many
                    variations but the basic concept is that the target is induced to part with his
                    money to the fraudster in the hope of realising a significantly larger gain. The
                    fraudster first baits the target by, for example, promising him a cut of a large
                    sum of money locked up somewhere in exchange for his assistance in transferring
                    the money through his bank account, or informing him that he has won a lottery.
                    If the target expresses interest, the fraudster would take him through a series
                    of steps to effect the transfer of the “money”. However, there
                    would invariably be hurdles along the way and the fraudster would ask the target
                    to advance some of his own money first to pay administrative fees, deposits,
                    taxes, <em>etc</em>. The target, lured by the prospect of
                    easy money, coughs up the sum requested but would then encounter more hurdles
                    necessitating the payment of further sums of money. The process repeats itself
                    until the fraudster disappears without a trace or the target realises he has
                    been deceived. By then, the target would possibly have parted with substantial
                    amounts of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The fraud here was apparently perpetuated by
                    Michael among some members of the Christian community in Singapore which
                    included Teresa. It is not disputed that Teresa had advanced various sums of
                    money to Michael, in respect of which she sued him for recovery. Teresa also
                    claimed damages against Jonathan for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation
                    in respect of the fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Teresa obtained interlocutory judgment against
                    Michael on 11 August 2009 due to the latter’s failure to comply with
                    an “unless” order. The trial before this court was only to
                    determine Teresa’s claim against Jonathan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Teresa and Jonathan were advocates and
                    solicitors who at the material time practised under the Raffles Group Law
                    Practice. Teresa joined the group sometime in early 2001 practicing under the
                    name of C Teresa &amp; Co. She was called to the Singapore Bar in 1982. Jonathan
                    joined later that same year practicing under the name of Tan Partnership. They
                    initially got along well together both professionally and socially and this was
                    in part due to their mutual Christian background. Teresa was a volunteer for her
                    church in many overseas missions while Jonathan was a pastor. They also worked
                    together on several cases in their practice and shared legal fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in mid-2002, Jonathan introduced
                    Michael to Teresa and mentioned that Michael was a fellow Christian. Michael had
                    at that time presented himself as a businessman cum international banker who was
                    trying to retrieve a sum of US$45.8m from an account with a bank in London
                    called the “First Merchant Bank”. Apparently, the money belonged
                    to Michael but in order to obtain the funds, he was first required to pay a tax
                    to an entity called the “British International Monitory [<em>sic</em>] Fund” (“BIMF”). Michael had
                    also apparently negotiated with one Dr Paul Smith from BIMF to pay part of
                    the tax first to secure the release of a proportionate amount of the funds,
                    which would then be used to pay the remaining tax for the balance. As such,
                    Michael needed to raise S$150,000 for the purpose and promised a 100% return to
                    those who could assist him financially to achieve his goal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The events that subsequently transpired between
                    Teresa and Jonathan are disputed but suffice it to say, Teresa was convinced
                    enough to participate in Michael’s scheme. By an agreement dated
                    17 July 2002 (“the First Agreement”), Teresa agreed to
                    advance S$150,000 to Michael, and handed him two cash cheques (drawn on her
                    overdraft facilities with her banks) totalling the said amount. In return,
                    Michael gave Teresa a post-dated cheque for the sum of US$172,911 (equivalent to
                    S$300,000 at the agreed exchange rate of US$1 to S$1.735). It was not disputed
                    that the First Agreement was prepared by Jonathan. Michael then remitted the
                    S$150,000 to a local company called Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd (sometimes
                    misspelled as Shanker’s in the documents), which was supposedly the
                    authorised revenue collector for BIMF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The funds in Michael’s account with First
                    Merchant Bank were supposed to have been released shortly after the signing of
                    the First Agreement but in early August 2002, a new hurdle cropped up.
                    Michael’s story was that Dr Paul Smith’s superior in BIMF, one Mrs
                    Margaret York, was now insisting on the full payment of the tax before any funds
                    would be released. Michael thus needed to raise another US$380,000 to pay the
                    balance of the tax. Teresa was of course upset by this turn of events and again,
                    what happened next between her and Jonathan was disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In any event, Teresa eventually entered into
                    another agreement with Michael dated 14 August 2002 (“the Second
                    Agreement”). Under the Second Agreement, Teresa would advance a further
                    sum of S$672,600 (equivalent to US$380,000) to Michael, in consideration of
                    which she was “guaranteed” a dividend of S$1,008,900, amounting to
                    about a 150% return. The total sum due to Teresa thus increased to S$1,681,500.
                    The Second Agreement further stipulated that Michael was to pay the S$1,681,500
                    to Teresa by 26 August 2002, with a penalty of S$5,000 per day chargeable
                    from 29 August 2002 until payment. Finally, the Second Agreement also varied the
                    terms of the First Agreement in that Teresa would now stand to collect S$315,000
                    under the First Agreement, being her principal of S$150,000 and a dividend of
                    S$165,000. As with the First Agreement, the Second Agreement was also prepared
                    by Jonathan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In order to raise the additional S$672,600 for
                    the Second Agreement, Teresa obtained a bank overdraft facility using her
                    condominium flat as collateral. She then executed a telegraphic transfer of the
                    funds to Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd. Pursuant to the Second Agreement,
                    Teresa received another post-dated cheque from Michael for US$950,000
                    (equivalent to S$1,681,500 at the agreed exchange rate of US$1 to
                    S$1.77).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Unfortunately for Teresa, the returns promised
                    by Michael did not materialise by 26 August 2002 and there were no signs
                    throughout the rest of the year that she was going to be paid. It is unclear
                    what happened from here until mid-2003 although Michael apparently flew to
                    London in late 2002 to enquire about the release of the US$45.8m. It seemed that
                    Michael was encountering more and more administrative obstacles in his bid to
                    have the funds released to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In May 2003, Michael apparently needed more
                    funds allegedly in connection with the release of the US$45.8m. Thus, by another
                    agreement dated 13 May 2003 (“the Third Agreement”), Teresa
                    and Jonathan agreed to advance US$10,000 and US$5,000 to Michael respectively.
                    In return, Michael promised to pay US$127,500 and US$63,750 to Teresa and
                    Jonathan respectively by 21 May 2003, with a late payment interest of 10%
                    per annum. Like the First and Second Agreements, the Third Agreement was also
                    prepared by Jonathan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Not surprisingly, the promised returns on the
                    Third Agreement never materialised. Michael’s story to Teresa and Jonathan
                    was that First Merchant Bank was unable to release the US$45.8m because of a
                    last minute intervention by the Nigerian government. Apparently, the Nigerian
                    government had suspected that the funds in the account were illegally siphoned
                    from Nigeria, and had obtained an injunction against First Merchant Bank
                    requiring the latter to remit the funds back to Nigeria. After further
                    investigation by the Nigerian authorities, the funds were found to be legitimate
                    and were thus transferred to an account with the Union Bank of Switzerland
                    (“UBS”) to be released to Michael. However, Michael was first
                    required to pay a “European Union Tax” of 2% (amounting to
                    US$916,000) plus a further auxiliary sum of US$4,580 to an entity called the
                    “European Tax Advisory Board” before the funds would be released
                    to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Michael thus started roping more people into
                    the scheme, presumably to raise the funds required to pay off the 2% tax. From
                    September 2003 onwards, Michael entered into agreements with various
                    “investors”, promising them an extremely high rate of return
                    (ranging from 100% to 200%) within 30 days of their initial payment. Some of
                    those investors appeared as witnesses at the trial and testified that they were
                    introduced to Michael by mutual Christian friends. While Michael was raising
                    this money, Jonathan had also been negotiating with one Peter Bockli
                    (purportedly from UBS) to pay the 2% tax in instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Around the same time, the Commercial Affairs
                    Department (“CAD”) commenced an investigation into Michael’s
                    affairs. Pursuant to the investigation, Jonathan furnished several documents to
                    CAD in January 2004 at its request. The documents comprised Michael’s
                    online account statements with First Merchant Bank and correspondence with both
                    the bank and BIMF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Michael eventually managed to raise enough
                    money from his various investors to pay part of the 2% European Union Tax but
                    this was still not yet the end. Apparently, UBS then insisted on payment of
                    certain audit fees. In September 2004, Jonathan wrote on Michael’s behalf
                    to several investors informing them of the development and assuring them that
                    their monies would be paid with the promised returns in due time. Unfortunately,
                    it seemed that Michael was unable to raise enough monies to pay the audit fees
                    in full. From late 2004 to early 2005, Jonathan corresponded with one Vieri
                    Mallorca and one Lawrence Weinbach, who purportedly worked for UBS, assuring
                    them that Michael would eventually settle the audit fees to effect the release
                    of his funds. It was not disputed that until April 2005, Michael was still
                    entering into new agreements with investors in order to raise funds. All the
                    agreements for the fund-raising exercise were drafted by Jonathan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, UBS apparently started to lose
                    patience with Michael’s inability to pay the audit fees and threatened to
                    remit the US$45.8m back to Nigeria in early 2005. There was no more
                    correspondence between Jonathan and the purported UBS officials after April
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In August 2005, CAD began another round of
                    investigations on Michael and he did not enter into any more agreements with
                    investors thenceforth (save for a single agreement dated 9 May 2006 which
                    he made with an existing investor). Finally, by a letter to Michael dated
                    13 July 2006, CAD stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our investigations into the case have been completed. We have reasons to
                        believe that you are a victim of a fraud as the correspondence allegedly
                        from UBS had been verified to be fictitious in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are hereby advised to refrain from soliciting further loans for such
                        purposes. You may be liable for criminal conduct if you persist to continue
                        with such activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was unclear what happened to the other
                    investors eventually but Teresa on her part had not recovered the monies she had
                    invested with Michael. Understandably, she was completely devastated when she
                    realised she had been cheated and that the monies she had paid to Michael were
                    never coming back. To make matters worse, she was saddled with substantial debts
                    since she had borrowed heavily from her banks to provide funds to Michael under
                    the First and Second Agreements. Teresa eventually settled her debts by selling
                    off most of her assets and by drawing on her savings. Subsequently, she made
                    several enquires and discovered that First Merchant Bank, BIMF, and the European

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Teresa commenced this action against Michael
                    and Jonathan in July 2008. As noted earlier at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>, Teresa has obtained interlocutory judgment against
                    Michael.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In her statement of claim Teresa alleged that
                    Jonathan had fraudulently or negligently misrepresented to her that
                    Michael’s scheme was genuine, which caused her to advance monies to
                    Michael under the three Agreements which were never repaid. Teresa claimed
                    damages from Jonathan in respect of those losses. Aside from the three
                    Agreements, Teresa had also advanced other sums to Michael between 2002 and
                    2005, presumably in connection with Michael’s scheme, and accordingly
                    claimed recovery of those sums from Jonathan. The details of the additional
                    payments are as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was not disputed that Jonathan was never
                    involved in the three investments set out in the above table. Those investments
                    were made between Teresa and Michael and were wholly separate from the three
                    Agreements. In fact, it was Teresa herself who drafted the agreements for the
                    three investments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Fraudulent misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was unclear whether Michael was the
                    ultimate mastermind behind this entire fraud or whether he had been similarly
                    deceived and ended up dragging many other victims down with him. In the light of
                    the letter from CAD (referred to at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                    above), and the fact that he had not absconded by the time these proceedings
                    began, it is more than likely that Michael too was a victim of fraud. The real
                    perpetrators of the fraud were those who had masqueraded as Paul Smith, Peter
                    Bockli, and the numerous other individuals and organisations with whom Michael
                    and Jonathan had corresponded and who remain scot-free to this
                date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although Michael was probably not complicit in
                    the fraud, the evidence at trial strongly suggested that he had, in any event,
                    been dishonest with Teresa and the other investors from whom he procured funds.
                    Teresa and Jonathan both testified that Michael had told them he was a director
                    for Asia of a bank called the “Swiss-Euro Credit Bank”, and had
                    even given them name cards so stating. However, his professed identity was
                    clearly false as no such bank existed. No one really knew what Michael did for a
                    living although it came to light in the course of the trial that he had
                    previously been convicted and sentenced to nine years’ jail in 1981 for
                    his involvement in a conspiracy to cheat a bank using false documents to
                    negotiate letters of credit and making false insurance claims. Unfortunately,
                    this was not known to Teresa and the other investors, who only knew Michael as a
                    Christian brother in need of financial assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Much of the background evidence adduced at the
                    trial was incomplete but from available documents, it seemed fairly obvious that
                    Michael had been lured by unknown scammers with the promise of quick money, and
                    was so eager to lay his hands on his new-found wealth that he was willing to lie
                    about himself and promise the moon and more to third parties so that he could
                    raise the funds needed to unlock the fortune that was awaiting him. The critical
                    question to ask is whether Jonathan was complicit in Michael’s dishonesty
                    in promoting the scheme to Teresa.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In this regard, Jonathan testified that he had
                    also been a victim of, rather than an accomplice to, Michael’s schemes. He
                    deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that even
                    before the present fraud involving the US$45.8m with First Merchant Bank arose,
                    he had already lost money in a separate and unrelated investment scheme that
                    Michael had introduced to him. The scheme apparently involved the raising of
                    S$100,000 to pay for the release of cash in diplomatic courier boxes located in
                    London. Jonathan deposed that he, together with his pastor friend Pattamuckil
                    John Johney (“Pastor John”), invested some money in the scheme
                    along with some monies belonging to their church (they had convinced their
                    church council to authorise the investment). However, to date, they had yet to
                    receive any payment from Michael from that investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Jonathan further explained that when the
                    present scheme to retrieve the US$45.8m from First Merchant Bank came up,
                    Michael had approached Jonathan and Pastor John for more money. However, they
                    had no more funds to invest and that was when Jonathan suggested that Teresa
                    might be interested. Jonathan thus introduced Michael to Teresa. Jonathan said
                    that from then on, the only role he played in the entire scheme was as
                    Michael’s solicitor. Thus, for the next three years, Jonathan was the
                    person who corresponded with the fictitious persons and organisations on
                    Michael’s behalf, and who drafted the various agreements between Michael
                    and his investors. The only additional investment he made was when he and Teresa
                    paid Michael US$5,000 and US$10,000 respectively pursuant to the Third
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, Jonathan also testified (in
                    re-examination) that he was never paid by Michael for the introduction to Teresa
                    or for any other assistance he had rendered to Michael. Jonathan explained that
                    he did not bill Michael for his legal services because there was no prospect of
                    his being paid and he did not want to be taxed on those unpaid bills had they
                    been rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I find that Jonathan had acted honestly when
                    he introduced Teresa to Michael and informed her about the latter’s
                    scheme. As I mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                    above), it appeared from the evidence that even Michael himself was unaware that
                    the entire scheme was a scam. That being the case, Jonathan, who was acting on
                    Michael’s instructions, would similarly be unaware of the fraud. Although
                    Michael did behave dishonestly in representing himself as a banker, I did not
                    think that Jonathan would have known of this as he had no reason to suspect
                    Michael at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Even if Michael was indeed knowingly complicit
                    in the entire fraud, the evidence adduced at the trial was nevertheless more
                    than enough to exonerate Jonathan. There were numerous documents detailing
                    Jonathan’s correspondence with the faceless individuals who had assumed
                    the identities of Paul Smith, Peter Bockli, and the other fictitious parties who
                    were supposedly in control of the US$45.8m belonging to Michael. Those letters
                    and emails were solely between Jonathan and such other party and showed that
                    Jonathan had been negotiating and arranging for Michael’s payment of
                    whatever taxes and fees that were needed for the release of the US$45.8m. Since
                    all those letters had not been created for the benefit of any other person, the
                    only possible inference was that Jonathan had truly believed Michael’s
                    scheme was genuine and was dutifully conveying his client’s instructions
                    to the fictitious individuals at the other end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Initially, it was difficult to believe that
                    Jonathan could have acted as Michael’s solicitor throughout without
                    realising that the entire scheme was a scam. The many letters sent to Michael
                    and Jonathan by the supposed BIMF and UBS officials were written in an
                    unprofessional manner in poor English, while the documents they sent
                    “evidencing” Michael’s ownership of the US$45.8m looked
                    dubious and amateurish. Moreover, the mere fact that further payments were being
                    demanded each time without any sight of the promised money should have been
                    cause for suspicion. Nonetheless, it is a truism that things always look clearer
                    in hindsight and the evidence clearly showed that Jonathan was taken in by
                    Michael’s schemes at that time, even after Teresa and the other investors
                    had been anxiously waiting for their money for months and even years. Since
                    Jonathan himself had invested some money with Michael, it was more than likely
                    that he wanted to believe that Michael’s schemes were real and had adopted
                    an attitude of what can only be described as foolish optimism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Counsel for Teresa (Mr S Gunaseelan)
                    pointed out that Jonathan had continued to prepare agreements for Michael and
                    his investors even after January 2004, when he knew that CAD was already
                    investigating Michael’s affairs. However, Jonathan’s explanation,
                    which I accept, was that in January 2004, CAD had only asked him to provide them
                    with documents relating to the US$45.8m account with First Merchant Bank since
                    he was Michael’s solicitor. He was not given any other information and he
                    was not privy to CAD’s investigations. It was only when CAD sent its
                    letter dated 13 July 2006 to Michael (referred to at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above), advising him to refrain from
                    soliciting further loans, that Jonathan ceased to prepare any further agreements
                    for Michael.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Gunaseelan also took issue with
                    Jonathan’s failure to call Michael as a witness. However, while Michael
                    would certainly be in a position to shed more light on the relationship between
                    himself, Teresa and Jonathan, I do not think an adverse inference should be
                    drawn against Jonathan since the existing evidence was sufficient to show that
                    Jonathan had acted honestly. I do not believe Michael’s evidence would
                    have added anything to the facts that were already adduced in court from the
                    parties and/or from their witnesses. There were no gaps in the testimony that
                    required Michael’s input to fill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For the above reasons, I am of the view that
                    Teresa’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against Jonathan is
                    unsustainable. Jonathan may have been a fool to accept without question whatever
                    Michael said but he was certainly not a knave.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Negligent misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The only other issue left to decide is whether
                    Jonathan is liable to Teresa for negligent misrepresentation. This in turn
                    depends on whether Jonathan had assumed responsibility to Teresa for whatever
                    assurances he had given her about Michael’s scheme, and whether Teresa had
                    relied on such assurances to her detriment in circumstances as to give rise to a
                    duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Teresa’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Teresa deposed in her AEIC that in July 2002,
                    Jonathan came into her office and told her that he wished to share a secret with
                    her. He then told her about Michael whom he described as a “very
                    committed Christian” and a “high-powered senior international
                    banker”. Jonathan claimed that Michael was managing an international fund
                    which was making lots of money and wanted to use it to bless fellow Christians.
                    This was the US$45.8m account with First Merchant Bank. Jonathan then brought up
                    the problem about the tax which had to be paid to BIMF and said that Michael was
                    trying to raise money from Christian friends to pay this tax. He also informed
                    Teresa that he had already recommended her to Michael to join this project and
                    “be blessed” since he had received many blessings from her in the
                    past and wanted to return the favour. Jonathan also mentioned that some of the
                    Christian friends whom Michael had chosen to “bless” were already
                    in the project with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Teresa went on to say that she was hesitant to
                    get involved at the time because she was not a risk-taker by nature. Jonathan,
                    however, assured her that he had verified that the fund was real because he had
                    been to London with Michael and Pastor John and met the relevant people. Even
                    then, she still asked him several times whether the investment was safe, to
                    which he replied that she could trust him and he would do all the work for her,
                    including all the due diligence, legal documentation, monitoring and follow-up
                    work. To give added protection, Jonathan offered to draft an agreement between
                    Teresa and Michael, and suggested including high percentages of returns as a
                    reward for Teresa’s participation. Jonathan also suggested adding in a
                    clause that if Teresa did not receive her money in full by a particular date,
                    she would be entitled to a penalty payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Despite all this, Teresa was still hesitant to
                    commit herself. Jonathan then told her that BIMF had stipulated a timeline for
                    payment of the tax and if this tax was not paid in time, Michael’s scheme
                    would fail and the other Christians in the scheme would not be able to receive
                    their blessings. Teresa thus felt pressured to step in and help Michael and the
                    other investors. It was on this basis that Jonathan introduced Teresa to
                    Michael, which led to the conclusion of the First Agreement. Even on
                    17 July 2002, the day the First Agreement was supposed to be signed, Teresa
                    still had doubts about the matter. However, Jonathan assured her that
                    Michael’s scheme was not an investment, but a Christian scheme and
                    God-sent opportunity for them and other Christians. He told her again to trust
                    him and reassured her that the transaction was safe. Consequently, Teresa signed
                    the First Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Throughout the subsequent three tumultuous
                    years, when Teresa was induced to enter into the Second and Third Agreements and
                    part with more and more sums of money to Michael, Jonathan kept telling Teresa
                    to trust him and that she would get her monies back soon. At one point, Jonathan
                    told her that Michael had a very nice and expensive apartment in Clementi which
                    he had visited. Thus, even if Michael failed to return Teresa her monies, he
                    could still sell the apartment and use its proceeds to pay her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There were many other details in
                    Teresa’s AEIC which need not be repeated here but suffice it to say, the
                    gist of her testimony was that she had put complete trust and reliance on
                    Jonathan, who assured her repeatedly that Michael’s scheme was safe and
                    that he had done the required due diligence. She thus felt cheated and betrayed
                    by Jonathan when Michael’s entire scheme fell apart.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lastly, Teresa also relied on the evidence of
                    several investors who subsequently came into Michael’s scheme when he was
                    raising money to fund the 2% European Union Tax (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Those investors testified that they had been
                    introduced to Michael by mutual Christian friends and had given him various sums
                    of money in connection with his scheme. They also gave evidence that they had
                    relied on Jonathan (to differing degrees) in deciding to enter into the
                    scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jonathan’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Jonathan’s evidence was far more concise
                    and very different. He deposed that he was first introduced to Michael in late
                    2001 by Pastor John. Pastor John (DW2) testified for Jonathan and said that he
                    himself became acquainted with Michael earlier that same year through a mutual
                    friend. Shortly after Michael got to know Jonathan and Pastor John, he
                    approached both of them with an investment proposal, which was the diplomatic
                    courier boxes investment referred to earlier (at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above). However, the returns on that investment did not
                    materialise because the British Home Office was apparently asking for a
                    Certificate of Release and until this was arranged, the funds could not be
                    released. In 2002, Michael again approached them for help in relation to the
                    US$45.8m in First Merchant Bank. Michael acknowledged that he still owed
                    Jonathan and Pastor John the monies from their earlier investment and promised
                    to repay them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As I noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above), Jonathan said that he and Pastor John
                    had no more money to invest at that time and this was when Jonathan thought
                    Teresa might be interested in Michael’s scheme. He thus introduced Teresa
                    to Michael and from then on, the main discussions on the investment took place
                    between Teresa and Michael directly. It was Michael who showed her the various
                    documents relating to the existence of the US$45.8m fund and who assured her of
                    the authenticity of the scheme. As for the legal documentation, it was Teresa
                    and not Jonathan who dictated the terms of the three Agreements she signed with
                    Michael. When various hurdles cropped up which required the payment of more
                    monies, Teresa went to Michael for answers instead of Jonathan. Jonathan further
                    deposed that his last contact with Teresa prior to this suit was when she met
                    him and another colleague for lunch (this was at the end of 2005 shortly after
                    she left Raffles Law Group Practice). The summary of Jonathan’s evidence
                    therefore was that he was involved in the scheme solely as Michael’s
                    solicitor and this was a fact known to Teresa. He did not assume any
                    responsibility towards her and neither did she rely on him in her decision to
                    invest in the scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Teresa and Jonathan gave diametrically
                    opposing versions of events such that if I were to accept one side’s
                    version, it would naturally mean that the other side had not been truthful.
                    Having considered the evidence, I am inclined to favour Jonathan’s version
                    of events over Teresa’s, for a number of reasons which are set out
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No evidence that Teresa had blamed Jonathan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     First, there was no evidence that Teresa had
                    even once blamed Jonathan when the returns on her investment never materialised,
                    or even when she realised the entire scheme of Michael’s was a complete
                    scam. On the contrary, the emails produced at trial clearly showed that Teresa
                    looked only to Michael for her money. For example, there was an email to Michael
                    dated 4 September 2002 in which Teresa expressed her unhappiness about the delay
                    in receiving her returns from the Second Agreement, and asked for his
                    reassurance that he would use his own funds to repay her if the monies from the
                    US$45.8m did not materialise. The following paragraph from the email is
                    particularly telling:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To arrive at a closure next week, I would like to see your sincerity
                        towards me and the return of trust (<em>since you have asked
                            me to trust you so many times</em>... this is one time I am asking
                        you to return that trust)...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above paragraph showed that it was Michael, rather than Jonathan,
                    who had repeatedly asked Teresa to trust in his scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There were also two other emails dated 1 and
                    5 August 2003 in which Teresa again blamed only Michael (in much harsher
                    tones) for the continued delays in receiving her money. Although she did mention
                    in the earlier email that Jonathan and Pastor John had a hand in convincing her
                    to invest her money, her unhappiness was directed only at Michael. Finally, in
                    an email to Michael dated 9 February 2004, Teresa wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tai Kor [this was how Teresa addressed Michael then],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I observe that everybody in your deal gets to know what’s happening,
                        except me. [Pastor John’s] group is continuously updated by Jonathan,
                        whereas Philip, John and Johnson are continuously updated by you, and they
                        would in turn update their investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As part of your professionalism and ethics, you should inform me
                        continuously too as I am a large investor, and you should do it <u>automatically</u> instead of waiting for me to ask.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     All the above emails strongly suggested that
                    it was Michael, not Jonathan, in whom Teresa placed her trust and who Teresa
                    expected would update her with news of her investment. Teresa did not produce a
                    single email or letter to Jonathan in which she sought to blame him for her
                    predicament, despite her assertions that she had relied on him completely to
                    look out for her interests. Although Teresa mentioned in cross-examination that
                    she did write a few angry emails to Jonathan accusing him of putting her in the
                    current mess, she was unable to produce any of those at trial with the excuse
                    that she was unable to locate them. I did not believe her explanation as she had
                    no trouble producing emails she wrote to Michael between 2002 and
                2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Teresa also testified that it was around 2004
                    to 2005 that she concluded that she had been the victim of a fraud perpetrated
                    by Michael and Jonathan. This was when she was still with Raffles Law Group
                    Practice. Despite this, after she left the group, she was still able to have
                    lunch with Jonathan and one Mok Ching Tee who was the leader of the group. When
                    Teresa was cross-examined on this, she claimed that the purpose of that lunch
                    was to return her office keys to Mok. She also denied inviting Jonathan to the
                    lunch, but had simply told Mok that he could bring Jonathan along if he so
                    wished. I found her explanation to be unconvincing because if she was indeed
                    angry with Jonathan, she would not even have brought his name up in the first
                    place let alone lunch with him. It was also not disputed that Teresa did not say
                    anything to Jonathan at the lunch which would suggest that she blamed him for
                    being cheated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On the evidence, it is to be noted that the
                    first time Teresa actually pointed the finger at Jonathan was when she wrote to
                    CAD on 15 April 2008 accusing Michael and Jonathan of drawing her into the
                    scam with false assurances. I gave little weight to her self-serving letter
                    because it was obvious that by then Teresa was about to sue
                Jonathan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence that showed Teresa was in control and dictated the terms of
                her various agreements with Michael</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I also did not believe Teresa’s story
                    that it was Jonathan who had included the attractive terms in the three
                    agreements to entice her to invest in Michael’s scheme. Jonathan produced
                    a note in Teresa’s own handwriting in which she had written out several
                    terms which were eventually incorporated into the Second Agreement.
                    Teresa’s explanation in her AEIC was that Jonathan had suggested those
                    terms for her to scribble down, and she later gave those notes to him for
                    reference when he prepared her agreements with Michael. I found Teresa’s
                    explanation unconvincing. The simpler and more probable explanation was that
                    those terms were dictated by Teresa herself and she scribbled the note to
                    Jonathan because she knew he was Michael’s solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     A more damning piece of evidence was to be
                    found in a letter from Jonathan to Teresa dated 12 August 2002. In the
                    letter, Jonathan wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Teresa</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>SECOND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Enclosed is a Draft Agreement as requested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please note the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    I have spoken to
                            Michael Ng about the broad principles, i.e. that you want 150% return on
                            your 2<sup>nd</sup> Investment and he has agreed.
                            However, please note that with regard to the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Investment of SGD150,000.00, he is
                            offering to pay you 5% on SGD300,000.00 on late
                            payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    I have <u>not</u> spoken to Michael about the
                            following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    S$5,000.00 per day for late payment on the
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Investment;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   Regarding his consent to enter into judgment
                                for the sale of his flat (on second thoughts, it sounds a bit too
                                harsh), perhaps you may want to waive this in good
                            faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It was clearly evident from the above letter
                    that Teresa was the person dictating the terms of the agreements she signed with
                    Michael, contrary to her assertion that Jonathan had voluntarily offered to
                    include those terms “as a reward” for her participation. Teresa
                    subsequently gave another handwritten note dated 15 August 2002 to Jonathan
                    in which she stipulated the various modes of payment to her when the monies from
                    her investment came in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Even more telling was the fact that, Teresa
                    personally entered into three further investment agreements with Michael (of
                    which Jonathan was unaware until the commencement of these proceedings) after
                    she had already signed the three agreements with Michael. Teresa claimed in her
                    AEIC that Michael had needed to borrow money urgently on those occasions and
                    that he had suggested that she draw up an agreement using the format of the
                    agreements Jonathan usually drafted. This explanation was not credible and could
                    not conceal the fact that even after the three agreements, when Teresa’s
                    monies were not forthcoming, she was still willing to invest more money with
                    Michael and continued to dictate the terms of her investments. Although Jonathan
                    was not involved in those later investment agreements, Teresa nevertheless
                    claimed damages from him under those transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the light of such evidence, I find that
                    Teresa was untruthful when she said that she only entered into Michael’s
                    scheme because she felt pressured by Jonathan to help Michael and his other
                    investors receive their “Christian blessings”. She saw
                    Michael’s scheme as an attractive investment, she knew what she wanted
                    therefrom and she was clearly in control at all times. Teresa was not a babe in
                    the woods who relied heavily on Jonathan to protect her interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence from Teresa’s other witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above), Teresa called several witnesses who had invested in
                    Michael’s scheme after September 2003, to testify that they had relied on
                    Jonathan. I gave no weight to their evidence because it was irrelevant. The
                    factual issue for this court to determine was whether Jonathan had assumed
                    responsibility towards Teresa and whether Teresa had in turn relied on Jonathan
                    to protect her interests. As such, it did not matter whether Michael’s
                    other investors had relied on Jonathan as they only came into the picture well
                    after Teresa had agreed to participate in the scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In any event I also found that those witnesses
                    were, for the most part, unreliable. It bears noting that the only person
                    Jonathan had introduced into Michael’s scheme was Teresa. In fact,
                    Jonathan had never met any of the other investors prior to their investing in
                    Michael’s scheme. Despite this, many of the investors gave evidence that
                    they felt at ease and confident of the scheme upon meeting Jonathan simply
                    because of his status as a lawyer and church leader, and the fact that he
                    practiced at an “impressive office”. This was a blatant attempt on
                    their part to support Teresa’s case. It was also not lost on this court
                    that despite their purported reliance on Jonathan, none of the witnesses have
                    sued Jonathan for the losses they suffered in participating in Michael’s
                    scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     A number of the witnesses went further and
                    alleged that Jonathan had assured them he had been to London with Michael and
                    personally verified the existence of the US$45.8m fund. This was categorically
                    denied by Jonathan, who said that the only time he had been to London with
                    Michael was in 2001 along with Pastor John, which trip related to their
                    investment with the diplomatic courier boxes and had nothing to do with the
                    US$45.8m in First Merchant Bank. I accept Jonathan’s evidence and find
                    that the witnesses were untruthful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other factual inconsistencies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There were many other factual inconsistencies
                    in Teresa’s evidence which cast doubts on her veracity. She mentioned in
                    her AEIC that sometime in 2003, Michael had told her that he had quarrelled with
                    Jonathan because Jonathan had apparently demanded US$1m each for himself and
                    Pastor John as a fee for introducing Teresa to his scheme. I found this story to
                    be incredible because Teresa’s total investment did not even reach US$1m.
                    It was also not explained in any event why Teresa did not confront Jonathan or
                    at least seek an explanation from him on Michael’s
                allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Teresa’s story that Jonathan was
                    promoting Michael’s scheme as a means to bless fellow Christians from the
                    start also made little sense because it seemed from the evidence that she was
                    the only investor at the time when Michael was raising money to pay the BIMF
                    tax. It was only much later, when the Nigerian government purportedly
                    transferred the US$45.8m to UBS and Michael started raising money for the 2%
                    European Union Tax, that there were records of other investors getting
                    involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Teresa also mentioned in her AEIC that she had
                    lodged a caveat over Michael’s HDB flat in March 2003 to protect her
                    interests. Aside from evidencing that Teresa was capable of looking after her
                    own interests, this fact contradicted her earlier evidence that Jonathan told
                    her that Michael had an “expensive apartment” which he could sell
                    to pay her back if the investment failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Demeanour of the witnesses at trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I formed the view that Jonathan was a far more
                    credible witness from observing his demeanour at trial. Jonathan answered
                    questions in a forthright manner and was candid in cross-examination, even
                    admitting to the court when he was questioned, that it did not occur to him from
                    the contents and the letterhead, that a letter dated 15 July 2002 Michael
                    received from a firm called Michael Baileys &amp; Co (who were purportedly the
                    English solicitors for First Merchant Bank) could not have been genuine. The
                    court had pointed out to Jonathan that English solicitors would sign their
                    letters and it was not usual to stamp the firm’s name with a date and
                    leave the letter unsigned. The letterhead also appeared suspicious as it looked
                    like it had been generated by a computer together with the address which was
                    appended at the bottom of the letter. Moreover, a firm of English solicitors was
                    unlikely to make such mistakes as writing “$480,000. Us Dollars”
                    with the letter ‘s’ in lower case. Jonathan revealed that he was not
                    familiar with UK solicitors. The court also drew to Jonathan’s attention
                    that the letter purportedly sent by Dr Paul Smith of the British
                    International Monitory Fund Tax Office Department dated 15 July 2002 could
                    not possibly have been genuine because of the misspelling of the word
                    “monetary” not to mention it was also chopped with a rubber stamp.
                    Again, Jonathan admitted that it did not strike him as unusual that a person
                    would sign and put a rubber stamp on the letter. Neither did Jonathan suspect
                    that the word ‘monitory’ should actually be
                    ‘monetary’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I should point out that Jonathan was called to
                    the local Bar in 1998 and his field of practice was in bread-and-butter areas
                    such as family law and debt collection. Consequently, Jonathan had no experience
                    of and would not be familiar with non-Singapore law firms or with international
                    bodies and organisations let alone international financial institutions. He was
                    certainly naïve but he was not dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Teresa’s demeanour, on the other hand,
                    was far too dramatic and gave the impression that she was putting on an act for
                    the court’s benefit. While she initially seemed genuinely aggrieved at
                    Jonathan for his role in the scam, she ultimately seemed too eager to answer
                    counsel’s questions at times to the point where she volunteered many
                    unnecessary details. Teresa’s oral testimony was also reflective of her
                    AEIC; it was embellished to the extent that it no longer sounded believable.
                    Teresa might have said a lot more than Jonathan but ultimately she left too many
                    important questions unanswered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Teresa’s email of 17 February 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I pause here to deal with one of the few
                    documents that actually supported Teresa’s case. In her email dated
                    17 February 2004 to one Johnson Wong (who was her witness), Teresa
                    wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Actually, until I got involved with Michael’s deal, life was a
                        breeze for me. No worries except for the passion of practising law to help
                        people get the justice they want. Then came Michael’s deal. I got
                        involved merely out of the good heartedness of mine to help release the
                        funds of those who had already sunk all they had in it, and had been
                        awaiting desperately for a long time. I was thus convinced by Jonathan and
                        [Pastor John] to get involved to help. I trusted them cos [<em>sic</em>] I thought I was dealing with Christians,
                        pastors, and church money and since they needed help and it was supposed to
                        be for a short period only (one month was what Michael and gang told me!!!),
                        that I lent them all I got [<em>sic</em>] !!! Never
                        realize [<em>sic</em>] how foolish it was of me to
                        trust people so much. Then when I got into trouble with UOB, Michael kept
                        telling me not to worry ...he would do something to help me. That promise
                        went by for one and a half years!!! And he never delivered. That’s why
                        I am so cross with him. He broke my trust over and over again, until now I
                        worry whether the deal is a scam or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Although Teresa’s email did give some
                    credence to her story that she got involved with Michael’s scheme at
                    Jonathan’s persuasion and without any intention of profit, this alone was
                    not enough to tip the scales to her side given the other overwhelming evidence
                    in favour of Jonathan. It was possible that by the time she wrote this email,
                    she was having doubts about the entire scheme but still refused to accept,
                    emotionally, that she might have been fooled by the prospect of a quick profit.
                    She may have wanted to help Michael, Jonathan and Pastor John along the way but
                    this was certainly not the only or even the primary reason for her agreeing to
                    participate in the scheme. It is also noteworthy that even in this email, Teresa
                    was blaming only Michael and not Jonathan for breaking her trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I have no doubt that Jonathan and Pastor John
                    did play <em>some</em> part in convincing Teresa to
                    participate in Michael’s scheme as this was borne out by some of the
                    emails Teresa wrote. I also note that both of them had a vested interest in
                    convincing Teresa to invest her monies because if Michael was able to retrieve
                    the US$45.8m from First Merchant Bank, he would then be able to pay them the
                    returns from their previous investment with the diplomatic courier boxes.
                    Nevertheless, in the light of the other factors I have highlighted above, I find
                    that Jonathan had neither given any assurance to Teresa that he would look out
                    for her interests, nor did he assume any responsibility for whatever he told her
                    about Michael’s scheme. I also find that Teresa in any event did not rely
                    on Jonathan. She well knew that Jonathan was acting only as Michael’s
                    solicitor and she placed her trust in Michael alone. Consequently, there was no
                    duty of care owed by Jonathan to Teresa. He is therefore not liable to her for
                    any negligent statements he might have made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The fraud in issue was a very unfortunate
                    episode for all the people who were involved in Michael’s scheme and is a
                    stark reminder of the adage that if a deal looks too good to be true, it
                    probably is. While the court is not unsympathetic to Teresa for the losses she
                    has suffered, it was clearly disingenuous of her to attempt to blame those
                    losses on Jonathan. It was unfair of Teresa to repeatedly accuse Jonathan in
                    cross-examination of being a liar when the objective evidence showed
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     For the reasons given earlier, I dismiss
                    Teresa’s claim against Jonathan with costs on a standard basis to be taxed
                    unless otherwise agreed.</p>
