It was only from around 2017 that Mdm Lakshmi allegedly “progressively acquired more control” over Gokul Vegetarian, and Mdm Rajeswary was “gradually frozen out”. Things reached a breaking point when, in or around 2018, Mdm Rajeswary began to suspect that Mdm Lakshmi was channelling money from Gokul Vegetarian to a competing business. However, when she began questioning Mdm Lakshmi and Mr Rauinderan, and requested to inspect Gokul Vegetarian’s accounting and financial records, Mdm Lakshmi made a number of counter-accusations and sought to thwart her enquiries.

First, the price which the plaintiff agreed to pay for the assignment of each debt was typically a sum approximately 90% of the debt in question. For example, the plaintiff would pay $5,659.97 as consideration for the assignment of a $6,288.85 debt, $9,765.19 for the assignment of a $10,850.21 debt, and $2,475.32 for the assignment of a $2,750.36 debt.

</div> On paper, it would appear that the plaintiff stood to make a profit of around 10% of the value of the original assigned debts. However, as shall be discussed later at [60], the plaintiff was in all likelihood fully aware that it would recover very little to nothing from Gokul Vegetarian. As such, if the plaintiff had in fact paid the agreed consideration for the assigned debts up front, then rather than making a profit, it would very likely have made a loss instead. This would have been attractive to a trade creditor who was concerned about recovering their debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, the second notable feature of the assignment agreements was that the plaintiff would <span class="font-italic">not</span> in fact pay the agreed consideration upon execution of the deeds of assignment. Instead, such consideration was only to be paid “upon receipt from Gokul Vegetarian Restaurant &amp; Cafe Pte Ltd and/or liquidator”.

</div> This meant that it was only if the plaintiff did recover any of the trade debts from Gokul Vegetarian or its liquidator, that it would pay the assignors the sum recovered, capped at the agreed consideration for the assignment. In effect, the plaintiff was able to claim the standing to rely on the trade debts in its winding up application <span class="font-italic">without</span> any risk of loss in the bargain. Such an arrangement was highly advantageous to the plaintiff, and was without doubt the product of a commercially sophisticated mind. Conversely, the assignors derived no financial benefit from this arrangement at all.

She further contended that, given that the winding up application was motivated by the collateral purpose of wresting control of Gokul Vegetarian’s underlying business from Gokul Vegetarian and herself, it should be dismissed as an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Accordingly, the principal issues which arise for my consideration are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does Mdm Rajeswary have standing to oppose HC/CWU 198/2021?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Should HC/CWU 198/2021 be dismissed as an abuse of process?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether Mdm Rajeswary has standing to oppose the winding up application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does a shareholder/contributory have standing to oppose a winding up order?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is generally accepted that a contributory has standing to oppose a winding up application (<span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong v </span><span class="font-italic">Gilcom Investment Pte Ltd (LRG Investments Pte Ltd and another, non-parties)</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1156 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Chek Chin v ANS Import &amp; Export Pte Ltd (formerly known as Ang Ngee Seng Import &amp; Export Pte Ltd)</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1002 at [15]–[19]), and pursuant to s 4(1) of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed), this also includes the holder of fully paid shares in the company.

</div> However, as both parties’ arguments rely on the test for granting leave propounded in <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin Pte Ltd v Electronic Cash and Payment Solutions (S) Pte Ltd (Andy Lim and others, non-parties)</span> [2022] SGHC 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span>”), I find it useful to begin by examining the reasons which led the court in<span class="font-italic"> Atlas Equifin</span> to find that a shareholder/contributory has standing to oppose a winding up application at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 First, r 69 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Corporate Insolvency and Restructuring) Rules 2020 (“CIR Rules 2020”) provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Copy of winding up application and supporting affidavit to be provided to creditor or contributory</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69. Every creditor or contributory of a company is entitled to be provided, by the applicant of a winding up application in respect of the company, with a copy each of the application and the affidavit supporting the application within 48 hours after requiring the same, upon payment of $1 per page of such copy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The fact that the shareholder/contributory is entitled to receive the same information as a creditor, information necessary to oppose a winding up application if they so wish, signifies an intention that the former should also have the standing to do so (<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> at [19]-–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Second, Form CIR-15 of the CIR Rules 2020, which is to be used as a notice of intention to appear at the hearing of a winding up application, clearly contemplates and provides for a situation where a contributory might wish to do so (<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> at [32]). I also observe that the same may likewise be said of Form CIR-16, in accordance with which the winding up applicant must prepare a list of the names and addresses of persons who have given such notice of their intention to appear at the hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, s 201 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IRDA”) provides that the court may have regard to the wishes of creditors or contributories as to all matters relating to the winding up of a company. That the court is entitled to consider their wishes and interests in a winding up, must imply that they have standing to present those views to the court in a winding up hearing (<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In addition to the above reasons canvassed in <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span>, I find further support for this position in s 186 of the IRDA, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to stay or terminate winding up</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">186.—(1) At any time during the winding up of a company, the Court may, on the application of the liquidator or of any creditor or <span class="font-italic">contributory</span>, and on proof to the satisfaction of the Court that all proceedings in relation to the winding up ought to be stayed or terminated, make an order —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) staying the proceedings either altogether or for a limited time, on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) terminating the winding up on a day specified in the order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Given that the IRDA clearly contemplates a shareholder/contributory bringing an application to stay or terminate a winding up, the necessary conclusion is that such an individual does have standing to bring an application in opposition to the winding up of a company. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does a shareholder/contributory require leave to oppose a winding up application? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having found that a shareholder/contributory has standing to oppose a winding up application, <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> then went on to suggest that a leave requirement was necessary to guard against the possibility of “frivolous opposition by shareholders” (at [34]). In this connection, it listed several factors which ought to be considered when deciding whether leave should be granted, which I shall collectively refer to as the “<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> leave factors” (at [33]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the shareholder/contributory has a substantial interest in the winding up application, as determined with reference to the size of their shareholding; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the company is solvent;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of the shareholder/contributory opposing the winding up application; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The countervailing interests of the company’s creditors, with more weight being given thereto where the creditors are unpaid and the company is unable to pay its debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> also observed that if such a leave requirement was “unsuitable in the light of the legislative framework”, the court could nonetheless guard against frivolous opposition by attributing it no weight, which would in essence amount to not granting the opposing shareholder/contributory leave to be heard at all (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Respectfully, I am of the view that the second approach is indeed more consistent with the legislative framework. While s 186 of the IRDA clearly contemplates a shareholder/contributory making an application in opposition to winding up proceedings, neither the IRDA nor the Rules of Court imposes any requirement to seek leave or permission of court before doing so. The <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> leave factors may instead be considered alongside the other facts relevant to the court’s exercise of its discretion to refuse a winding up order, which will be discussed below at [48].

</div>
</div> she would therefore have standing to oppose the winding up application as of right, and it is for the court to decide how much weight her objection ought to carry.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If a shareholder/contributory requires leave to oppose a winding up application, should it be granted in the present case? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Even if I were to follow <span class="font-italic">Atlas </span><span class="font-italic">Equifin </span>in holding that a shareholder/contributory requires leave in order to oppose a winding up application, I am of the view it should not be invariably required in all cases to demonstrate that the company in question is solvent before leave to oppose is granted. While a reasonable inquiry where opposition is premised on a dispute as to the debt underlying a statutory demand, the purpose of this factor is ultimately to ensure that the opposing contributory/shareholder has a genuine interest in the outcome of the winding up application (<span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span> at [33(b)]). Yet, as the present case demonstrates, where a company has allegedly been deliberately rendered insolvent to facilitate the takeover of its business, a contributory/shareholder may have such an interest notwithstanding its insolvency. Likewise, little if any weight ought be given to the countervailing fact that a creditor is unpaid and the company is unable to pay its debts, where this has been allegedly engineered. Demonstrating solvency therefore ought not be the only way by which a shareholder/contributory might establish a genuine interest in the winding up application. This position is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Atlas Equifin</span>’s characterisation of its leave factors as “non-exhaustive” and “useful” (at [33]) rather than mandatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This being the case, Mdm Rajeswary should be granted leave to oppose HC/CWU 198/2021. She is a 50% shareholder and a director in the Gokul Vegetarian, and it is undisputed that she has a significant interest in its business. There is also nothing in the evidence that casts doubt on her <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. No weight should be given to the fact that Gokul Vegetarian is insolvent and the debt underlying the statutory demand remains unpaid given that there appears to be at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that this situation has been deliberately engineered, lest such acts be allowed to go unchallenged for want of any party that has both the motive and standing to oppose them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the winding up application should be disallowed </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having found that Mdm Rajeswary has the standing to oppose HC/CWU 198/2021, I then turn to consider the substantive merits of the application, and her opposition to it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does the court have discretion to disallow a winding up application even if the company is indisputably insolvent? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 S 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the IRDA provides that the court may order the winding up of a company if it is unable to pay its debts, and pursuant to section 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, this fact may be deemed or presumed if the statutory requirements therein are fulfilled. This presumption does not appear to be rebuttable (<span class="font-italic">Pac-Asian Services Pte Ltd v European Asian Bank AG</span> [1987] SLR(R) 6 at [14]), and the default position is that a winding up order should be made <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae</span>, or as a matter of right, where a company is proven or deemed unable to pay its debts (<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd v RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tong </span><span class="font-italic">Teik Pte Ltd)</span> [2021] 2 SLR 478 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>”) at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, even if a company is proven or deemed insolvent, or if the other statutory bases for winding up are made out, the court nonetheless retains a discretion to decline to grant a winding up order (<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [85]; <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP</span>”) at [15]–[20]), and there are two broad categories of situations in which the court may do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, the court may disallow a winding up application which amounts to an abuse of process, pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its processes (<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 348 (“<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har</span>”) at [22]). These include applications or proceedings where the processes of the court are employed for an ulterior, collateral, or improper purpose (<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har </span>at [22]–[23]), such as to delay or derail proceedings which were brought against the winding up applicant (<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har</span> at [29] and [32]), or to allow the winding up applicant to circumvent established buyout mechanisms and exit the company at will (<span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping v Scanone Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 95 at [75]–[76]; <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other matters </span>[2017] SGHC 84 at [37]). Claims found to amount to a collateral attack on a prior decision have also been regarded as an abuse of process and dismissed accordingly (<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon </span>[2018] 4 SLR 359; <span class="font-italic">Kwa Ban Cheong v </span><span class="font-italic">Kuah Boon Sek and others</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 644). That said, the categories of conduct which might render an application an abuse of process are not closed, and will depend on all the relevant circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong </span><span class="font-italic">Jin and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (<span class="font-italic">“Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [22]). One would expect this observation to apply with equal force in respect of the sorts of purposes which might be found to be ulterior, collateral, or improper. Indeed, the touchstone of abuse of process is the need for the court to prevent the improper use of its machinery, and this would invariably require considerations of public policy and the interests of justice (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter </span>at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, the court also retains a general residual discretion to consider all other relevant factors when deciding whether a company should be wound up, even if the statutory grounds for doing so have been technically established (<span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 763 (“<span class="font-italic">Perennial Capitol</span>”) at [82]). Such factors have been understood to include the utility and effect of a winding up order, the overall fairness and justice of the case (<span class="font-italic">Perennial Capitol</span> at [82]), the responsibility of the winding up applicant for the state of affairs forming the factual basis upon which the winding up order is sought (<span class="font-italic">In the Matter of the Companies Ordinance, Cap 32 and in the Matter of Power Point Engineering Limited </span>[2000] HKCFI 800; [2000] HKCU 501, endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har </span>at [31]–[33]), the viability of the company, the economic and social interests of the company’s employees, suppliers, shareholders, non-petitioning creditors, customers, and other companies in the group enterprise (<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [85]), and the possibility that granting a winding up order may cause irreparable harm to the debtor company (<span class="font-italic">BNP </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>”) at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Should HC/CWU 198/2021 be dismissed notwithstanding Gokul Vegetarian’s insolvency? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I thus proceed to consider whether HC/CWU 198/2021 was indeed motivated by such a collateral purpose, and whether the overall fairness and justice of the case weighs in favour of or against my granting it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There was a scheme to wrest control of Gokul Vegetarian’s underlying business from Gokul Vegetarian and Mdm Rajeswary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having considered the chain of events laid out above, I find that on balance of probabilities, there was a scheme orchestrated chiefly by Mdm Lakshmi whose purpose was to wrest control of Gokul Vegetarian’s business from Gokul Vegetarian and thus from Mdm Rajeswary as well. Indeed, there are numerous facts which together make it extremely unlikely that the 4 September 2021 EGM was merely an innocent attempt to raise money to save Gokul Vegetarian, or that HC/CWU 198/2021 was simply the unfortunate result of a genuine but unsuccessful effort to keep Gokul Vegetarian afloat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, it is clear that Mdm Lakshmi had a desire to see Mdm Rajeswary removed from Gokul Vegetarian. This is evident not only from her submission of the notice of change of directors on 21 April 2021, but also from her testimony at trial, during which Mdm Lakshmi explained that she did so “because we felt that [Mdm Rajeswary] did not do her fiduciary duties” and “we were just suffering with [Mdm Rajeswary].”

</div> In this regard, I stress that I make no finding as to whether Mdm Lakshmi’s motives were justifiable or reasonable, nor as to the truth of her allegations that Mdm Rajeswary had been derelict in the discharge of her duties as director of Gokul Vegetarian. Whether it was for what she perceived to be the good of Gokul Vegetarian or more self-serving ends, it is beyond doubt that she wanted Mdm Rajeswary out of the picture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, I find that the chain of events leading up to the filing of HC/CWU 198/2021 was set in motion in order to bring about the demise of Gokul Vegetarian, in furtherance of this goal. While Mdm Lakshmi claims that the purpose of the EGM was simply to raise funds to address Gokul Vegetarian’s cash flow problems,

</div>
</div>
</div> it is difficult to believe that it was purely coincidental that it was called the<span class="font-italic"> </span>day after she was served the papers for HC/OS 842/2021. It should be recalled that HC/CWU 198/2021 is based on a statutory demand for the $20,000 debt Gokul Vegetarian owed to the plaintiff, which had been incurred as a result of a payment by the plaintiff to Gokul Vegetarian at the EGM. In other words, the chain of events which led up to the present application was set in motion the <span class="font-italic">very day</span> <span class="font-italic">after</span> Mdm Lakshmi became aware that her original attempt to remove Mdm Rajeswary from the management of Gokul Vegetarian’s underlying business might fail. Furthermore, the $20,000 received by Gokul Vegetarian could never have been enough to fully pay off the $43,795.12 owed to 78 Capital Pte Ltd, and indeed would have left a debt large enough to ground a statutory demand of its own. Coupled with the remarkable timing of the calling of the EGM, this provides support for the inference that the holding of the EGM and receipt of $20,000 from the plaintiff were not part of a genuine attempt to save Gokul Vegetarian, but rather an “insurance policy” of sorts in case the first attempt to oust Mdm Rajeswary failed, as eventually came to pass. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Third, it is also difficult to believe that Mdm Lakshmi was genuinely motivated by a desire to save Gokul Vegetarian, when she had begun taking steps to transfer its assets to Gokul-Raas well before the statutory demand underlying HC/CWU 198/2021 was served on 28 September 2021. Particularly inexplicable is the fact that she had by 17 September 2021 executed a fresh tenancy agreement for 19 Upper Dickson Road on behalf of Gokul-Raas, two days after Gokul Vegetarian had been served with the notice of termination for the very same premises on 15 September 2021. This was followed by her changing of the name on Gokul Vegetarian’s SFA license from Gokul Vegetarian to Gokul-Raas on 20 September 2021, and then changing the employer of Gokul Vegetarian’s foreign employees to Gokul-Raas on 23 September 2021. Leaving aside the question of whether she was entitled to make these changes in the first place, these are hardly the actions of someone who, at least as of 6 October 2021, genuinely hoped that “funds would still come in, and we could save the company somehow”, and believed that “even though the termination had been there, I think if we could get the funds on time, we could have saved the place”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 More puzzling still is Mdm Lakshmi’s failure to make any effort to inform Mdm Rajeswary of the termination of Gokul Vegetarian’s tenancy, the statutory demand, the filing of HC/CWU 198/2021, and the transfer of Gokul Vegetarian’s assets to Gokul-Raas. If Mdm Lakshmi had still believed and hoped that Gokul Vegetarian could be saved as at 6 October 2021, then informing Mdm Rajeswary of what had transpired since 1 September 2021 would have only further emphasised the direness of the straits that Gokul Vegetarian was in, and the need to approve the issuance of shares to the plaintiff before it irretrievably sank beneath the waters. Mdm Lakshmi attempted to attribute this failure to their “acrimonious relationship”,

Even after Gokul-Raas had secured the tenancy agreement for 19 Upper Dickson Road on 17 September 2021, and after HC/CWU 198/2021 was filed and served on 27 October 2021, Mdm Lakshmi misleadingly deposed in her 24 November 2021 affidavit that “[Gokul Vegetarian] <span class="font-italic">could have</span> already lost its premises which would have completely destroyed [Gokul Vegetarian] in September 2021”.

</div> However, it is difficult to believe that, in the face of over $40,000 of outstanding rent, a landlord would be so concerned about less than $600 in legal fees that it would bother making a separate unrecorded request for payment thereof. And if it was, then it is equally puzzling as to why this request had not been made in the original letter of demand. Possibly more believable is that, as Mdm Rajeswary’s counsel suggests, Mdm Lakshmi had arranged for 78 Capital Pte Ltd to terminate Gokul Vegetarian’s tenancy in favour of Gokul-Raas, and was simply compensating them for their trouble.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, Mdm Lakshmi’s credibility is further undermined by her inconsistent accounts of the purpose of the plaintiff’s $20,000 payment to Gokul Vegetarian. On 15 November 2021, in response to allegations that Mr Sharma could not genuinely have believed that Mdm Rajeswary would consent to the issuance of the shares and that the $20,000 was therefore a “sham loan”, Mdm Lakshmi’s solicitors took the position that the payment was entirely unrelated to the issuance of shares.

</div> Mr Sharma therefore caused the payment of $20,000 to be made to Gokul Vegetarian in exchange for the issuance of a small fraction of the intended 300,000 shares. The problem is that Mr Sharma had been present when the resolution for the issuance of this tranche of shares to the plaintiff had been proposed, and had witnessed that it had been unequivocally rejected. He nevertheless claims to have believed that Mdm Rajeswary could still have been persuaded to change her mind, failing which he would have expected the $20,000 to be returned.

</div> That being the case, it is quite inexplicable how he might have genuinely thought that Gokul Vegetarian would have been capable of returning the $20,000 in the event that Mdm Rajeswary did not agree to issue the shares to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The circumstances surrounding the plaintiff’s obtaining the assignments of the trade debts also point towards their being part of a deliberate plan to wind up Gokul Vegetarian. In particular, the timing of the assignments strongly suggests that they were primarily intended to strengthen the plaintiff’s position in HC/CWU 198/2021. The assignments took place between 9 to 12 November 2021, a period beginning on the very day when Mdm Rajeswary’s lawyers first alleged that the $20,000 Adcrop debt was either a “sham loan” or due from Mdm Lakshmi personally. In other words, they began the very day Mdm Lakshmi and the plaintiff first realised that the Adcrop debt might be disputed and hence incapable of supporting a winding up order on its own. Much like the convenient timing of Mdm Lakshmi’s calling of the EGM, this remarkable coincidence likewise seems consistent with the putting in place of an insurance policy in case the initial plan of action succumbed to legal challenge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Next, at least one trade creditor admitted that it was Mdm Lakshmi who had informed him of Mr Sharma’s role in commencing HC/CWU 198/2021 and put them in touch.

</div> Indeed, it is difficult to see how else Mr Sharma, then an outsider to Gokul Vegetarian’s business, might have established contact with the trade creditors. While not in itself conclusive, the fact that Mdm Lakshmi had a role in procuring the assignments does lend further support to the inference that they were intended to further her plan to have Gokul Vegetarian wound up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Finally, there simply is no other plausible commercial rationale for the assignments, nor for the entire winding up application itself. Mr Sharma claimed that the arrangement would have resulted in a “small profit” accruing to the plaintiff, ostensibly to help cover the legal fees incurred in the present action.

</div>
</div> it is also very likely that he never truly believed that anything would be recovered, given his knowledge of Gokul Vegetarian’s dire financial straits as discussed above at [60]. Indeed, having demonstrated the sophistication and astuteness necessary to structure the assignments in the way he did, he could not have failed to realise that the legal expenses incurred in prosecuting HC/CWU 198/2021 would far outstrip anything which might realistically be recovered from Gokul Vegetarian. His persistent attempts to wind it up cannot be explained as simply a misguided exercise in throwing good money after bad, but rather suggest a motive beyond the clearly unlikely recovery of the debts owing to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is therefore clear that HC/CWU 198/2021 is not a genuine attempt to recover a genuine investment made for legitimate commercial reasons, but was rather motivated by the collateral and improper purpose of advancing Mdm Lakshmi’s scheme to wrest control of Gokul Vegetarian’s business from Gokul Vegetarian and Mdm Rajeswary. Indeed, it is extremely telling that the plaintiff provides in its closing submissions no real answer to Mdm Rajeswary’s allegations of a deliberate ploy to render Gokul Vegetarian insolvent, nor makes any attempt to explain the commercial basis for either its own actions or those of Mdm Lakshmi. Its best case in this regard is simply to repeat its assertions that Gokul Vegetarian no longer has any premises, business, assets, or any hope of repaying its debts, and essentially entreat the court to ignore the reasons why this might be so,

However, if I had to decide the issue, then while the foregoing analysis has proceeded on the basis that the debts were incurred by Gokul Vegetarian, I would have allowed that there is a substantial and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> dispute as to whether this was in fact so. This finding would be sufficient to serve as an alternative basis upon which to dismiss the winding up application (<span class="font-italic">Atlas </span><span class="font-italic">Equifin </span>at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62]; <span class="font-italic">BNP </span>at [9]; <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, there is some room for doubt as to whether the plaintiff’s payment of the $20,000 to Gokul Vegetarian was in fact meant as consideration for the issuance of shares, such that the plaintiff is entitled to repayment since those shares were not issued. As noted above at [22], Mdm Rajeswary’s solicitors had earlier alleged that the Adcrop debt was in fact a sham loan or a personal loan to Mdm Lakshmi, although I note that this point was not covered in closing submissions. Additionally, as observed at [57], Mdm Lakshmi was inconsistent in her account of what the purpose of the payment was, first claiming that it was entirely unrelated to the issuance of shares, but later claiming at trial that it was for the issuance of shares. Coupled with my finding that both Mdm Lakshmi and Mr Sharma were acting in concert to bring about the winding up of Gokul Vegetarian, this shifting account raises a real possibility that the true basis of the payment as subjectively understood by both Mdm Lakshmi and Mr Sharma might not be as they claimed at trial. This in turn calls into question the viability of any attempt on their part to mount a claim in unjust enrichment on the grounds of failure of basis or consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is also not a foregone conclusion that the plaintiff would succeed in a claim for breach of contract, because it is not clear that there was in fact any genuine agreement between the plaintiff and Gokul Vegetarian. If there had truly been an agreement for an advance payment in anticipation of Mdm Rajeswary giving her consent to the issuance of shares, and if there had truly been an understanding that the money would be returned if her consent was not obtained, then one would have expected the parties to have agreed on a date by which either of these events had to be procured. However, absent any evidence in respect of a key aspect of this alleged agreement, there is at least a triable issue as to whether any such agreement actually existed, and whether the transaction was truly genuine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In any event, even if the plaintiff had genuinely intended that the $20,000 would be consideration for shares, Mr Sharma knew that the resolution had failed to pass and that Mdm Lakshmi therefore had no authority to receive the money. He also had overheard the conversation between Mr Rauinderan, Mdm Lakshmi, and Mdm Rajeswary’s proxy during which it was made clear that Mdm Rajeswary would never agree to the share issuance. Moreover, Mr Sharma was fully aware that Gokul Vegetarian would be unable to return the money as it would be paid to the landlord. It is arguable that this knowledge may likewise affect the plaintiff’s ability to establish that there was a total failure of consideration or failure of basis. A finding against the plaintiff on any one of these points would mean that it would not be entitled to recover the $20,000 paid to Gokul Vegetarian, and thus cannot rely on it as the basis for winding up proceedings. It might even lead to the conclusion that, as Mdm Rajeswary argues, the payment was simply meant to “unconditionally allow Lakshmi to cause Gokul Vegetarian to pay an amount of $20,000” to its landlord.

</div> However, these are issues which cannot be dealt with summarily in the context of a winding up application, but should rather be resolved at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There is also a triable issue in respect of the assigned trade debts, and the plaintiff’s ability to bring a winding up application in connection therewith. First, as observed earlier at [25], there is some doubt as to whether the trade debts were actually incurred by Gokul Vegetarian, or whether some of them were in fact incurred by Gokul-Raas. Second, even if they were incurred by Gokul Vegetarian, there is a possibility that the formal notice requirement for the assignment of debts under s 4(8) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (1999 Rev Ed) was not satisfied, and that the plaintiff remains an equitable assignee in respect of the trade debts. Whether the court believes this is so turns on the credibility of Mdm Lakshmi’s testimony. However, it is difficult to believe her bare assertions that the notices were received by Gokul Vegetarian, when she has been consistently unable to recall whether she received them personally or through her staff.

</div> This is even more so given that, as the foregoing analysis has shown, she likely has a vested interest in the success of the winding up application, which would be strengthened if this court were to believe her assertions that the notices were served.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In this light, there is a real possibility that the plaintiff may merely be an equitable assignee. If this is found to be the case, then a further question would arise as to whether it has standing to bring the claim. As the plaintiff acknowledges in their closing submissions, there are no reported decisions in Singapore which address the question of whether an equitable assignee has standing as a creditor to serve a statutory demand and make a winding up application on the basis of the debt in question.

</div> On the other hand, in view of the High Court’s endorsement of the “established legal principle that, in order to transfer the legal right to a debt by an assignment, an absolute assignment must be executed and notice of this assignment must be given to the debtor” in <span class="font-italic">Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte Ltd (trading as Mount Elizabeth Hospital) and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Sandar Aung </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 227 at [12], and the Court of Appeal’s affirmation thereof on appeal in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Sandar Aung v Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte Ltd (trading as Mount Elizabeth Hospital) and another</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 891 at [40], there is at least a triable issue as to whether the plaintiff would have standing to bring winding up proceedings based on the assigned trade debts, if it is found to be only an equitable assignee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I conclude by stressing that, apart from the inferences which I have drawn in relation to the question of whether HC/CWU 198/2021 should be dismissed as an abuse of process, it is not my role to decide the merits of the underlying dispute between the non-parties. Even if there was some element of truth to Mdm Lakshmi’s allegations that Mdm Rajeswary had acted in dereliction of her duties as a director, the law affords her the means by which to test those allegations, and remedies of which she may avail herself if they are found to be true. She is not entitled unilaterally to adjudicate their truth, fashion her own remedy against Mdm Rajeswary, and expect this court to rubber stamp the execution thereof. The plaintiff’s attempt to assist her in doing so cannot merit the sanction of this court. Accordingly, I dismiss HC/CWU 198/2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I will hear parties on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Ang </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Senthil Dayalan (Sim Chong LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The defendant unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suang Wijaya, Sophia Ng and Shirin Chew (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the 1st non-party;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The 2nd non-party in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
