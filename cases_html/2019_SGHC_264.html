Be that as it may, it is not disputed that the signboards at the Clementi Centre displayed the name “REAL Education Centre” and not “Tuition Genius”. The Clementi Centre offered tuition in various subjects to primary, secondary and junior college (“JC”) students. Eugene taught economics classes for second year JC (“JC2”) students.

Firstly, I find Keng’s claim that he had sunk in $20,000 to $30,000 to the business in terms of renovation to the CCK flat and the purchase of furniture to be incredible. Eugene had used only one room for his tuition classes. From the photograph of the room, it appears to be a simple air-conditioned room with plain furniture.

</div> It is difficult to comprehend why such a large sum would be required. The only supporting document that Keng provided in support of the amount he spent was a receipt for the supply and installation of a “Toshiba Sys 4 Inverter” air-conditioning system from Gain City dated 5 July 2008 for the sum of $3,619 after a $400 trade-in for the existing air-conditioning unit in the flat.

Eugene gave evidence that the kitchen and bathrooms of the CCK flat were renovated in 2008 and that his mother, who was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, had paid for it although he did not know how she did it.

I find it difficult to believe that he would limit himself to a salary of $2,000 per month and split the rest with Keng in return for an unnecessary expenditure of $20,000 or more to the room. Furthermore, Eugene’s evidence was that the room was already air-conditioned is supported by the Gain City receipt which shows that there was a trade-in involved. Again, there is no reason that Eugene would forgo part of his tuition receipts for an unnecessary upgrade of the air-conditioner. This further supports Eugene’s evidence that the Toshiba air-conditioner was a gift from Keng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31  Thirdly, Keng said that he had not looked at the room used for the tuition after its renovation.

</div> If he had indeed invested more than $20,000 in the venture, this disinterest is rather puzzling especially since he was making regular social visits to the CCK flat at the time. This was not the only part of his investment that Keng was not interested in. His evidence was that he did not ask Eugene for his share of the profits until much later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, if Keng had spent any money on the CCK flat, this was because of the close ties between Keng and Eugene’s family.

The second agreement allowed Eugene to use TGPL’s resources to carry out joint promotional and marketing activities together with ETG and ETGPL.

</div> The fact that the business did not turn out as well as Keng had hoped does not mean that he did not see sufficient potential in it to make the investment at the time. Eugene also said that given his close ties with Keng, the terms surrounding the incorporation of TGPL could not solely have been assessed as a commercial joint venture.

</div>
</div> This was evident from the close ties shared between both families, as well as the father-son relationship they both shared. In my view, it is consistent with the nature of their relationship in 2009 for Keng to have permitted Eugene to carry on his existing TG Business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I turn to the remaining arguments by the plaintiff against the existence of the oral agreements. This turns on the lack of documentary evidence supporting the oral agreements, as well as the fact that Eugene signed the Employment Agreement with TGPL on 20 August 2009, in which he was appointed as Managing Director. Given the close relations between Eugene, Keng, and the trust and confidence which both were likely to have shared, it is not surprising that the agreements were undocumented. Indeed, on Keng’s own evidence, a few of the other agreements alleged to have taken place between the two of them were similarly undocumented: for instance, the agreement for Eugene to continue teaching the 20 students in the CCK flat, as well as the alleged profit-share agreement in relation to the Choa Chu Kang joint venture. In view of my finding on the Employment Agreement at [51] below, I also do not agree with the plaintiff’s argument that the signing of the Employment Agreement evidences that the oral agreements did not take place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I turn to the plaintiff’s evidence on this aspect. At para 24 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), Keng said as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As it turned out, [Eugene] did not give me any financial information about the business. Eventually, I asked [Eugene] directly to account for the profits made by our business. [Eugene] apologised.  He said that he had spent all the profit on himself. I was annoyed. When I questioned [Eugene], he was able to calm me down, and then he quickly changed the subject. He said that we should grow our current business by opening tuition centres around Singapore. He explained his plans for expansion. He said that we should incorporate a company for this expanded business. He promised he would not spend all the profit on himself again, and said he would sign a contract to prove his sincerity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  Therefore, the plaintiff’s position is that it was Eugene, and not Keng, who proposed to set up TGPL for the purpose of opening tuition centres around Singapore. This arose out after Keng berated Eugene for his failure to account for the profits of the tuition business at the CCK flat. Keng said that Eugene subsequently prepared a contract, which is the Employment Agreement, which they both signed. Keng said that under the fresh joint venture agreement, Eugene was expressly prohibited from carrying on any other tuition business in competition with the joint venture.

</div> The sole exception to this prohibition was that Eugene would be allowed to continue teaching his 20 existing students in the CCK flat, and retain the fees from those students until they graduated from junior college.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I have already dismissed the plaintiff’s version of events in relation to the CCK joint venture above at [32]. Given that I do not believe Keng’s account of the CCK joint venture, it follows that his version of how the “fresh joint venture agreement” came into being cannot be believed. It is also difficult to understand how Keng could have been persuaded to sink in more money after realising, as he claimed, that Eugene had not only not paid Keng his share but did not even undertake to re-pay what was owed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Thus, I find that the two oral agreements existed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff argues that, even if the Continuation of TG Business Agreement and the Joint Marketing Activities Agreement existed, the Employment Agreement effectively “varied or terminated” them.

Keng said that he was very annoyed with Eugene but the latter quickly changed the subject and at this point proposed the TGPL business venture to him.

</div>. Eugene said that he wanted to lead by example and signed the Employment Agreement which had the same terms as that for all the other employees of the plaintiff. He did not think of the conflicts in the Employment Agreement with his prior oral agreements with Keng. It is clear from the evidence that the Employment Agreement was adapted from a template off the internet. Furthermore, the evidence shows that Keng had no knowledge of this aspect of the administration of the plaintiff’s affairs as he had left it entirely to Eugene. But what is clear is that, given the oral agreements Keng had subscribed to, I am left with no doubt that, had it been brought up at the time, Keng would have agreed with Eugene that the terms of the Employment Agreement would be varied to make it consistent with the oral agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As I disbelieve Keng’s claim that he had a share in Eugene’s tuition business conducted in the CCK flat (see [454] above), it follows that Keng’s version of the genesis of the Employment Agreement cannot be believed. I also find that Eugene’s version is consistent with the general evidence of the circumstances in which the TGPL business was born. I therefore accept Eugene’s evidence on this issue and find that it was not the intention of the plaintiff, at the time represented by Eugene and Keng, to enforce any term of the Employment Agreement against Eugene that was inconsistent with the oral agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breaches of the Employment Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The finding above disposes of the plaintiff’s claim with regard to the breach of cll 5 and 11 of the Employment Agreement.

The plaintiff had to resort to circumstantial evidence and submit that during the material time, it was only reasonable that Xavier and Timothy would have asked Eugene for the reason(s) behind the non-renewal of their contracts at the end of 2013 and 2014 respectively. The plaintiff also submits that, as Eugene had said they were good tutors

</div>, it would follow that Eugene was behind the non-renewal of their contracts in order to get them to work for him. However, I find that this is not the only inference that can be drawn from the evidence, as there can be a whole range of events behind the non-renewal. I cannot make a finding on the evidence before me that Eugene had encouraged Xavier or Timothy to leave the employment of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, the prohibition in cl 12 covers more than mere solicitation. Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement prohibits Eugene against attempting to hire, which would include actually hiring, any other executive or independent contractor of the plaintiff. As Xavier had already left the plaintiff’s employ by 2014, when ETGPL was incorporated, there is no breach by Eugene in respect of him. However, Timothy only left the plaintiff at the end of 2014, but was engaged by Eugene in ThinkTank in May 2014.

</div> This manner of entrusting Jun Hao to handle payments to ETGPL and his registrations of students for ETGPL indicates to me that Eugene was completely lacking in secrecy in retaining the revenue collected from the economics classes taught at ETGPL and ETG. On account of this, I find that an agreement existed between Keng and Eugene for the latter to retain the said revenues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Such a finding also makes sense in the light of the overall evidence, in particular the Employment Agreement signed by Eugene. Clauses 7.1 and 7.5 of the Employment Agreement provided that no salary or director fees were to be paid to Eugene until “all initial start-up capital has been recovered”. Assuming that TGPL’s business was Eugene’s only source of income, this would mean that Eugene would have had no income until the full initial start-up capital of $90,000 was recovered. I do not think this to be likely, especially since Eugene was a relatively well-established economics tutor at the time of TGPL’s incorporation and must have been used to earning fairly substantial sums of money. An agreement between Keng and Eugene for Eugene to retain the revenues earned from his classes was likely, and indeed logical under such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For completeness, I also highlight two other aspects of the defendants’ evidence which I find consistent with its case.

</div> This suggests that Eugene’s business in ETG was regarded as distinct and separate from TGPL’sbusiness. The “Admin Guide” used by the financial and administrative staff of TGPL also clearly set out the various partners and different branches. The partners of the Clementi Centre of the plaintiff’s business was listed as “Mr Keng and Eugene” while the partner of Economics at TuitionGenius was listed as “Eugene”.

On Keng’s own evidence, Jun Hao was sent to work with TGPL so that Keng could “investigate” and “find out more information about the business”.

</div> Logically, it follows that if Jun Hao knew that money was being deposited into Eugene’s ETG bank account, Keng would find out as well. In any case, even without evidence of Jun Hao’s knowledge, I find that there is sufficient basis to infer the existence of an agreement between Keng and Eugene. This was premised largely on circumstances which showed that Eugene did not act in a surreptitious manner, as well as Keng’s knowledge of the ETG Entities and Eugene’s receipt of payments from his classes. I elaborate further on the latter reason at [92] – [94].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff’s case that Keng lacked knowledge rests on two limbs. First, that little or no weight should be placed on the defendants’ reliance on the transcripts of the conversation with Eugene as Keng was not specifically cross-examined on whether he had such knowledge. Next, none of the documents relied on by the defendants show that Keng had carefully reviewed Eugene’s claim forms from TGPL; and in any case the only reason why Keng signed such claim forms was because he trusted Eugene.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I do not believe Keng’s explanation that the only reason why he signed the claim forms was because he trusted Eugene. This is clearly an afterthought designed to advance the plaintiff’s case. As for the transcripts of the conversation with Keng, I agree that there is no <span class="font-italic">direct</span> statement to that effect that Keng had knowledge of Eugene’s TG Business. Nonetheless, the tenor of the conversation suggested that Keng believed that TGPL’s claims, and whatever action Jun Hao was taking in respect of this claim, was completely unmeritorious. For instance, Keng said:

But what stands out from those advertisements are the words “Real Education Centre” and not the phrase “Tuition Genius”. The plaintiff did exhibit documents in which the name of the company, TuitionGenius Pte Ltd, is printed prominently. Further, these were internal company documents. They were not marketing documents in respect of which resources had been expended to promote the mark. The plaintiff seems to be relying on the fact that the phrase “Tuition Genius” constitutes its name. But there is no evidence that it was used a mark to promote its services. Eugene’s uncontroverted evidence was that he has used the mark “Tuition Genius” to promote his own tuition business even before the plaintiff was incorporated. Eugene gave evidence that he had only agreed with Keng to use it in the name of plaintiff when they incorporated the company, but had had taken care to promote its services on a different and distinct identity. This is borne out by the evidence.

The defendants claimed that as the TG Mark is distinctive of Eugene’s tuition business, the continued use by TGPL and Jun Hao of the TG Mark would have caused the public to wrongly believe that Eugene’s business was still related to REC’s business, constituting an actionable passing off.

Furthermore, based on the available evidence before me, it appears that the Course Materials were in fact produced by Eugene in the course of his employment.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In my view, I do not think that the conversations between Eugene and Keng show that the “predominant purpose” behind the commencement of Suit 453 was to cause financial harm or injury to Eugene. All it seems to suggest is that Keng was stuck in between a rock and a hard place in having to balance his competing loyalties between his own family, and Eugene, someone he considered as a godson. At the time of the conversations, the relationship between Eugene and Keng was still good. It was therefore understandable that Keng was seeking to assuage Eugene’s fears that the present lawsuit would, in his words, “be invalid”. While Keng may have implied that his son Jun Hao’s motivations for commencing the suit were less than noble, namely, that it was procured to sow discord between Keng and Eugene, I am not convinced that the “predominant” purpose behind the suit was to cause financial damage to the defendants. The conversation also suggests that Keng may have believed, at the time of the conversation with Eugene, that the lawsuit against him was unmeritorious. This is self-evident from his saying “[the lawsuit] is bullshit”, “their stuff (referring to the lawsuit) will be invalid”, and “[Jun Hao and Xiang Qi] will realise whatever they’re picking up on is unreasonable”. I do not think that this alone is sufficient to prove that the <span class="font-italic">predominant </span>purpose behind the suit was to cause financial harm to Eugene. A decision to commence an unmeritorious lawsuit is not in every instance motivated by an intention to cause financial harm. In any case, even if the conversation showed that Jun Hao’s predominant purpose for commencing the suit against Eugene was to cause him financial harm, the conversation at the same time showed that this purpose was not shared by Keng. This can be seen from his reluctance to participate in the lawsuit against Eugene.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 For completeness, I also address the remaining pieces of evidence relied on by the defendants. I agree with the defendant that the Whatsapp conversations between Xiang Qi and Zi Hao, and those between Eugene and Jun Hao, showed that a great deal of animosity and resentment existed towards Eugene’s mother. However, I also take into account that this arose from their belief that she was having an affair with Keng. I also believe Eugene that his family was subjected to various instances of harassment by Keng’s family – the Car-Chase incident in which Xiang Qi drove into Eugene’s mother’s car being one such instance of this. Nonetheless, I think that it is a stretch to suggest that the instances of harassment by Keng’s family against Eugene’s mother, must lead me inescapably to the conclusion that Suit 453 was commenced with the predominant purpose of causing financial harm to Eugene. I also do not think that the circumstances under which Jun Hao came to be in control of TGPL, as well his prompt commencement of Suit 453 against Eugene, show that the predominant intention behind the suit was to cause financial harm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Although not argued by either side, another issue which I find problematic in the defendants’ case is that I could not identify a “combination of two or more persons and an agreement between them and amongst them to do certain acts”, a requirement set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [112]). Taking the evidence of the transcripts between Eugene and Keng at face value, it is clear that even if a conspiracy did exist to cause Eugene financial harm, there is no evidence that Keng was a party to it. Under such circumstances, I hold that the defendants have not proved lawful means conspiracy against Keng, Jun Hao, and TGPL on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 For the reasons above, I dismiss all the plaintiff’s claims except the claim for breach of cl 12 of the Employment Agreement in respect of Timothy.
