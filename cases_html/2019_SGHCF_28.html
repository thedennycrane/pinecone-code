The balances in the bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as these matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 For the other assets in general, the available values as close to the AM date as possible will be used.

The intention of the Husband’s parents in this regard was manifested by their request that the Husband’s sister and her family move out of the GB Property in around 1986.

In that case, the husband’s father had provided S$93,000.00 towards the parties’ exercise of the option to purchase the matrimonial property. Notwithstanding the evidence of the husband’s father on affidavit that the sum was for the benefit of the husband alone, his intention to benefit the couple jointly was reliably inferred from his objective acts (at [9] and [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9    … [H]e acted to provide the sum for the couple to purchase the property in their joint names without taking any additional steps to protect the sum from the wife, through a trust or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10    … It does not follow that just because the wife’s parents did not wish to contribute to the purchase that the father must therefore have intended only to benefit his son, the husband. It is equally reasonable to infer that the father had decided to help [the parties] with the purchase of the property for the benefit of both husband and wife which is consistent with their joint registration of the property. On balance, therefore, we uphold the Judge’s finding that the sums were intended as gifts to the couple on the basis that it was not against the weight of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I understood from the above reasoning that it was critical in <span class="font-italic">BON </span>that the property in question was purchased in the parties’ joint names. In contrast, the GB Property was purchased three years before the marriage and in the Husband’s sole name. The Property also appeared to be purchased for the (incidental) benefit of the Husband’s parents and siblings: the Wife did not appear to have a say as to who else was to live there. Indeed, she deposed that the Husband had told her that if the purchase of the GB Property proceeded, they would “be sacrificing [their] privacy as newly-weds as [they] would <span class="font-italic">have to</span> stay with [the Husband’s] parents and his other siblings” [emphasis added].

They contributed to the purchase of the GB Property with the intention that it should be a gift to him solely, and with the understanding that they (and their other children) would also benefit from such contribution. This intention was consistent with the fact that the GB Property was not purchased in the parties’ joint names, and by the subsequent use of the GB Property by the Husband’s parents and siblings, even though the Husband’s use of the Property was prioritised. I accordingly treat the S$379,000.00 used for the purchase of the GB Property as a gift from the Husband’s parents to him alone and apportion the full value of the Property of S$5.7m to him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The Robertson Quay Property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Wife submitted that she made 100% of the direct contributions to the Robertson Quay Property.

He also had multiple affairs during the marriage. Her homemaking and parenting contributions supported the Husband’s successful career.

In so doing, I take into account the High Court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>[2017] 4 SLR 921 at [25]–[27] and [32] that the court is not bound to adjust the average ratio only by according different weightages to the direct and indirect contributions.
