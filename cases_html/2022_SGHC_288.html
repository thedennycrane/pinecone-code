his “new counsel”) came on board to represent the accused, many allegations of inadequate legal assistance (“inadequate representation”) and complaints were raised against his previous lead counsel, Mr Johan, and assisting counsel, Mr Revi Shanker (collectively also his “previous counsel”), both of whom represented him from May 2017 to 12 July 2019.  The accused alleged that his previous counsel’s failure to follow his instructions had essentially compromised his defence.

As the accused’s new counsel had not completed taking full instructions from the accused and were not ready to deal with the accused’s allegations against his previous counsel, I proceeded to finish the main hearing first and have the defence close its case before dealing separately with these allegations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 12 July 2019, Mr Johan and Mr Revi Shanker discharged themselves from acting for the accused, whilst the accused was still being cross-examined by Mr Tiwary. At the discharge application, Mr Johan informed the Senior Assistant Registrar (“SAR”) of the following reasons for seeking a discharge:

The trial was part heard. Before the trial resumed, Babu succeeded in his fresh representations to the Prosecution to have his drug charge reduced from trafficking in not less than 38.98 grams of diamorphine to a substantially reduced amount of not less than 9.99 grams. Babu pleaded guilty before Ang Cheng Hock J on 9 April 2021 to a substantially reduced charge of trafficking in not less than 9.99 grams of diamorphine and was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

Presumably based on instructions from the accused first received by Mr Hassan only after completion of the accused’s cross-examination, an incident in the Supreme Court lock-up (“lock-up”) came to light during the accused’s re-examination where Mr Johan, Mr Revi Shanker, Mr Tiwary and their assisting counsel had a meeting with the accused in the lock-up. Certain disturbing evidence also surfaced. The accused testified as follows:

And if I let---if I were to let Babu go, then Babu will be out, and he will come back as a defence witness to speak in support of me. My former lawyers have also spoken to my family with regards to this. My family members are also aware of this matter. Just before the trial, just before the start of the trial, Mr Revi Shanker, Mr Johan Ismail, all my lawyers came to see me to interview me. That was the week of the trial. When my lawyers came to interview me in the interview room, there’s a door there, Your Honour. There’s a vanguard sheet, and I did see Mr Ramesh speaking to someone. And I saw ra---Mr Revi leave the room, and he was speaking to Ramesh Tiwary outside the interview room. When my lawyers were interviewing me about my case, I was telling them a lot of things about my case, but my counsel, Mr Johan Ismail, didn’t like it. And Mr Revi is aware that Mr Johan Ismail and myself get into arguments quite often. The trial had started that week. The trial had already started in 2018. After my lawyer, Mr Johan Ismail, had finished his cross-examination of the IO Mr Shafiq, he told me this. The---my lawyer told me this. Mr Johan Ismail told me that Mr Revi had told him that I had opened all the doors and now Ramesh is going to close all those doors. And before Mr Ramesh Tiwary cross-examined the IO, Revi came and told me that Ramesh wanted to speak with me.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Okay, fair enough.

We heard that. What did Mr Ramesh tell you?  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Ramesh told me, “I heard you wanted to speak with me.” Then I told Ramesh, “No, I didn’t want to speak with you. Revi said you wanted to speak with me.” I’m going to narrate what happened, what we spoke about. Ramesh Tiwary told me, “I’m Ramesh Tiwary. I know what I’m doing. You don’t mention Babu. You let Babu go, don’t mention his name.” He---in a way, he’s telling me to protect Babu. He said, “Your lawyers know about me. If you let Babu go and if you need any help, I will get help and---through your lawyers. My hair is all white, I have been a lawyer for the past 20, 30 years.” Then he gestured---he put his hand into his jacket pocket and say he has got the evidence with him. Then I told him, “I’m only narrating the truth of what happened.” There was a point of time I got angry because I just felt that they were scheming something, that there was something behind this. And because I got angry, I told Ramesh Tiwary to leave. Then after that, I cried and I told my lawyers, “I’ve been telling you all these years about my case, what are you all doing?” Then the Chinese lawyer, Melvin Low[sic] or something, ask me, “So what is your instructions now? To fight the case, right?[”] Then I told him, “Yes, that’s what I’ve been telling you all to do.[”] Then my counsels told me, “Yes, then we’ll carry on.” After that, we left the lock-up. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Okay, alright.

So I got very angry with that. I feel very stressed and frustrated when all this is happening, Your Honour. I’m not saying I didn’t do this, Your Honour, but he is very much involved in this. That’s my point. Because he tells me the drugs were---was not found on him per se so he don’t---he tells me that he can get away with it and he won’t be charged because he was not found with the drugs. Just because he was not found with the drugs, he thinks he can get away with it. Your Honour, and as my counsels, they should be fighting for me, Your Honour, and when Mr Ramesh Tiwary stands up and cross-examines me, I expect them to object and to make noise, Your Honour, but there I see them sitting down there and laughing with each other, Your Honour. I’m the one suffering, watching all this and I feel that I’m the one who is prejudiced, Your Honour. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Alright. Going back to your transcript, and I will move on soon after that.

Why I said that was I know as a lawyer he’s defending his client, that’s his duty, but there seems to be some scheme against me, Your Honour, in the way he is defending. That’s why I got angry and I---my outburst was I called him [referring to Mr Tiwary] a dishonest lawyer because I felt that the way he went about doing it seemed to be like that.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Okay. You also mentioned that he---you understand that he is the lawyer for Babu and he has to do his best for his client to defend his client. So what did he do wrong?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Your Honour, I get it that the lawyer is trying to protect him. What essentially they are saying is asking me to take responsibility for the whole thing and Babu is to go out and then he’s supposed to help me. But I feel that that’s not right, Your Honour. The manner in which I’ve gotten to know him and the way we both became friends and how close he was, he did all this, I feel that he is actually backstab me and he is just killing me, Your Honour, asking me to take the rap and he’s nicely going to walk away and not be involved at all. So I feel that it is not right. that is the part that I feel is not right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the above extract, there is a reference to an outburst where the accused called Mr Tiwary a dishonest lawyer. This had happened some months earlier on 4 March 2021 during the accused’s cross-examination by Mr Tiwary when the accused (who had all along been giving oral evidence in the Tamil language) suddenly shouted at Mr Tiwary in English saying: “<span class="font-italic">I am not blaming. You understand or not?  … </span><span class="font-italic">You came down below in the lock-up. You tell me. You take all the things [meaning the drugs]. And then you let Babu go off</span>.”

</div> This could be heard on the audio recording of the trial proceedings on 4 March 2021 just prior to the adjournment of the court for the day. The accused said that he had gotten upset and angry as the things that Mr Tiwary was saying and putting to the accused were untrue

</div>. I note that Babu had since pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in conjunction with the accused in this case (see [9] above). Babu was therefore involved with the accused in trafficking of the drugs just as the accused had stated. Accordingly, what had been put to him by Mr Tiwary, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the accused was lying about Babu’s involvement, was clearly untrue.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Events leading to the ancillary hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 After Mr Hassan and Ms Chitra had finished re-examining the accused, the DPP raised the following issue before me:

</div> In disciplinary matters, that would be applicable, but it would not follow for criminal cases. The DPP disagreed. The DPP referred me to the Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters</span> [2020] 1 SLR 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Farid</span>”) and mentioned that the Court of Appeal remitted the matter back to the trial judge to take further evidence to determine whether or not instructions that were given to the counsel were carried out or not carried out as the case might be.

</div> I informed the parties that we would not want to have this become a retrial as that would be very wasteful in resources. To avoid that, we could recall the accused to ask him whether there was any issue with his representation by counsel during the conduct of the trial prior to Mr Hassan and Ms Chitra coming on board as his present counsel. If the accused confirmed that he was not making any such allegation, then it would be alright.

</div> However, if the accused was making such an allegation and assuming there was a problem between the accused and his previous counsel that compromised his examination-in-chief, then there would be a complication.

</div> I said that the remedy was to have the accused return to give any other evidence that he wished to give to remedy the possible inadequacy in his representation by his previous counsel. With Mr Hassan now as his new lead counsel, the accused could have an opportunity to give all the evidence that he wanted to give in evidence-in-chief, as opposed to being limited to a re-examination of what he had been previously cross-examined upon. Then there could be further cross-examination and we would just finish one more round of that process.

What I’m more concerned is had there been inadequate representation which resulted in some prejudice to his examination-in-chief.

</div> To do that, the DPP said that the accused’s allegations pertaining to inadequate representation should be set out in an affidavit by the accused and his previous counsel should have the opportunity to reply.

</div> I agreed with the DPP that it would be very “messy” if the accused were allowed to redo his examination-in-chief without first having proved that his previous counsel’s representation was inadequate, to which the DPP added that it was unfortunate but as a matter of principle, the court should not simply give the accused the benefit of doubt that there was inadequate representation.

</div> In the course of the accused’s lengthy evidence-in-chief during the ancillary hearing, the accused’s complaints were distilled to ten specific complaints as set out below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mr Johan and Mr Revi Shanker deny the allegations made by the accused in his affidavit, in particular, those set out in Appendix 1 of the accused’s affidavit including the ten specific complaints that the accused alluded to in his evidence-in-chief.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Complaint No 1 – Accused’s further statement dated 6 February 2015 made to the Investigating Officer not admitted into evidence as instructed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The accused complained that his previous counsel did not follow his instructions to lead evidence during his evidence-in-chief to highlight the fact that he had made a further voluntary statement on 6 February 2015 (“6 February Statement”) to the Investigating Officer Mr Shafiq Basheer (“IO”). The accused wanted the 6 February Statement admitted into evidence so that the accused could explain in court why he had given this statement implicating Babu which was different from (a) his earlier handwritten statement where he stated to the contrary that Babu was not involved; and (b) his statement to the Senior Assistant Registrar (“PTC Judge”) at the Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) in December 2014 that Babu was not involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The accused wanted to have all the circumstances that eventually led him to provide the 6 February Statement to be admitted in evidence so that the court could better understand why he had changed his story in relation to Babu’s involvement. He wanted to be able to testify that Babu had pressured him into making a further statement to the IO to say that he (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu) was not involved. That was why at the December 2014 PTC, the accused said that Babu was not involved. As a result, the PTC judge directed a further statement to be taken to confirm the accused’s position. But when the further statement was eventually taken on 6 February 2015 some two months later, the accused changed his mind and did not follow through with his earlier story to the PTC judge. Instead, the accused told the truth to the IO to say that Babu was in fact involved and to state that it was fear and pressure from Babu, which caused him to say that Babu was not involved on previous occasions. More specifically, the accused wanted his further statement to the IO admitted into evidence to show that he had in fact mentioned that Babu had pressured him into making earlier statements that his co-accused was never involved. This was not done by his previous counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 After having provided his 6 February Statement, the accused maintained that Babu was involved in subsequent PTCs. He stood by that story. In other words, the only time his story was different was earlier in December 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I asked the accused to explain what happened between December 2014 and February 2015 that caused him to change his story from not implicating the co-accused (not being the Babu whom he dealt with) to one that implicated the co-accused as the Babu whom he dealt with in the drug transaction.

Then he realised that she was seeing another inmate caught for a drug-related matter. Babu told the accused that when he had a face-to-face visit with his family, he noticed Ms Kavitha meeting another inmate for a face-to-face meeting. The accused also heard from his own family that Ms Kavitha was seeing someone. Apparently, Ms Kavita was having an affair with that inmate but the accused did not know about it at that time. The accused learnt about it later in prison after he was told of it by Babu and the accused’s family members. Another inmate at a video link PTC informed the accused that Babu told him that the accused’s girlfriend had two-timed the accused. Upon hearing that at that point of time, the accused was so heartbroken that he in fact cried.

He thought things through and that was when he decided that he was not going to let Babu “play [him] out”. The realisation struck him during the tele-visit of 15 April 2016 when he overheard the conversation between Babu and his lawyer, Mr Tiwary, that Babu was going to get away with possession and that “things [were] going to change”.

He wanted to testify that he produced the handwritten statement due to the fear and the pressure that Babu was applying on him since 2014. To enable the accused to prepare the handwritten statement, Babu forwarded to the accused a folded note from which the accused was to copy the contents. The accused adhered to Babu’s instructions.

To his previous counsel, it obviously made no sense to adduce an incriminating statement as evidence. His previous counsel might not have fully grasped the underlying reason as to why the accused simply wanted to explain to the court that he had good reasons for his earlier different position exonerating Babu and his later position implicating Babu in the offence, just so that the accused could demonstrate to the court why he should not be treated or brushed aside as a witness who could not be believed due to his differing stances. The accused testified that: “If this statement did not go in, then I will make---be made to look like a liar. So I insisted that this handwritten statement has to go in.”

How are you sure of this?’ Then he told me, ‘Only if you do this, it’s good for you.’ To me, it sounded---it was absurd to me, because he’s supposed to be my lawyer, and he was listening to the co-accused’s lawyer, and I felt that he was not doing me justice. I told Mr Revi Shanker to look at the statement properly, to look at Babu’s statement properly to say that Babu is not going to help me. The statement clearly shows Babu will not help me. So I told him to look at the statement properly. What Babu actually wanted was to get out scot-free, otherwise, get a minimum sentence.

As the accused found it easier to communicate with Mr Revi Shanker than with Mr Johan, he instructed Mr Revi Shanker to obtain the CCTV camera footages of the lift landing on the 11th floor of the Toa Payoh flat and the lift landings on the 7th and 8th floor of the Commonwealth flat. Mr Revi Shanker’s initial response was that he would go back and look into it. But when Mr Revi Shanker came back and the accused raised the subject of the CCTV camera footages again, he told the accused all that was not necessary and said, “What you have should be enough”.

The accused felt that his previous counsel did not question him properly and bring out the accused’s reasoning for the inaccuracies. The accused said that he had explained to them that things did not happen in the way that was stated in the statement, and that he had told them how it actually happened. His previous counsel seemed to disregard what he told them. He sensed that they did not really take him seriously. According to the accused, every time the accused pointed out some inaccuracies, his previous counsel would dismiss him and say: “No, no need, go to the next one. This one not necessary.” The accused found his previous counsel to be dismissive of him. Accordingly, these inaccuracies in his statement were not properly dealt with when he was on the witness stand.

Another inaccuracy was that the statement had stated that the accused only came to realise the quantity of drugs which actually arrived after collecting the drugs. However, the accused testified that he had not said it like that, and that was not how the events actually happened. The accused also highlighted that there were inconsistencies in the statement in relation to Babu ordering the bundles whilst he was in Singapore.

However, the supplier inadvertently delivered three bundles of drugs to the accused. If the accused were to help exonerate the co-accused by testifying that the co-accused was not the Babu in question, then the accused believed that the co-accused would be in no position to help him in turn by testifying that there was an order of only one bundle of drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The accused said that the co-accused’s counsel, Mr Tiwary, and his previous counsel were all trying to persuade him to take full responsibility for the three bundles of drugs to exonerate the co-accused. Mr Revi Shanker also suggested that the co-accused would say that one bundle of drugs was ordered, and that the co-accused would get other witnesses to say that the additional two bundles of drugs were like “extras” not to be trafficked in.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The accused testified that his previous counsel had further informed him that the co-accused’s counsel had told them that if the accused did not assist the co-accused, then the co-accused would call at least five witnesses to give evidence at the trial that the accused had ordered three bundles of drugs. On this, the accused said that he felt that the threat emanated from the co-accused, who relayed the threat his own counsel, Mr Tiwary, who in turn informed the accused’s previous counsel, who in turn relayed it to him.

That was when the accused became angry that his own lawyer was asking him to support a co-accused and was not doing anything to help him.

Mr Revi Shanker kept pestering the accused and the accused was wondering why he was doing that. The accused said he had no wish to speak to Mr Tiwary and he really did not know what was happening.

Mr Johan agreed as that was the accused’s instructions.  It was not the case that the co-accused’s counsel wanted to speak to the accused. In the lock-up, the accused asked the co-accused’s counsel whether he was going to cross-examine him. The co-accused’s counsel said, “My defence is that [my] client had nothing to do with the 3 bundles”. The co-accused’s counsel then left.  The accused then told his previous counsel to fight on.

</div> Mr Revi Shanker exhibited his written notes of the meeting in the lock-up. It recorded the time and date as 11.45 am on 3 April 2019. Parties present were Mr Johan, Mr Revi Shanker, Mr Melvin, Mr Tiwary, Mr Satwant Singh, and Mr Ruben. Mr Revi Shanker took notes of the meeting and recorded the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Haridass want to see Ramesh to ask him about Babu’s defence before he start his EIC [examination-in-chief]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Haridass ask Ramesh whether he will cross-examine him. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ramesh told Haridass that he will cross-examine him, if Haridass implicates Babu’s involvement in ordering three bundles. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Haridass asked Ramesh whether his client [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu] will say that he [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu] ordered one bundle upon his [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu’s] instructions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ramesh says that his client has nothing to do with any ordering of bundles – that is his defence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ramesh told Hari that if Hari maintained his evidence that Babu ordered the 3 bundle and implicate Babu in any other way, he will cross examine Hari to show him Hari is a liar. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hari says okay to Ramesh’s saying.

He will know what to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The accused disputed this version of events as recorded by Mr Revi Shanker. The accused denied that he asked Mr Tiwary whether his client [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu] would say that he [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu] ordered one bundle upon his [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Babu’s] instructions. Neither did the accused ask about Babu’s defence. The accused explained that he already knew of Babu’s defence because he had been denying any involvement all along. Mr Tiwary did not say that he would cross-examine him if he implicated his client. Mr Tiwary said: “Don’t bite him. If you do, then I will get four or five witnesses to make sure that they will testify against you.” The accused said that his previous counsel had also already known of Babu’s defence prior to the lock-up meeting. In other words, there was no need to have a meeting in the lock-up just to ask what Babu’s defence was as stated in the lock-up meeting notes of Mr Revi Shanker because it was already known to both the accused and his previous counsel. The accused said he knew about Babu’s defence much earlier and that was before the committal hearing on 30 October 2015. As early as 2014, the accused had already heard that Babu’s defence was that he had nothing to do with this matter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was not involved at all. The accused recalled an incident in December 2014, when during a video link PTC session, he personally met Babu for the first time as they were seated next to each other at the holding room whilst waiting for their video link to start for the PTC session. At that first personal meeting, Babu told him to accept all the blame and to leave him out of it. Babu told the accused, “Okay, let’s fight this case together but when you are referring to your boss, don’t say that I am the boss, say it’s a Malaysian boss, refer to the boss as the Malaysian boss”.

</div> At that video link session, the accused did as instructed by Babu because the accused knew that Babu wanted to get out of the charge. Accordingly, the accused mentioned at the video link session that “The Babu I had been referring to is not this Babu”.

</div> The accused therefore exonerated Babu and accepted blame. Babu later hugged the accused and thanked the accused for doing so.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The accused did not have any reason to believe that Babu’s position in relation to his defence would change from his initial position with the passage of time. In other words, the accused disputed his previous counsel’s version of events. The accused maintained that it was not true that the accused had wanted to see Mr Tiwary in the court lock-up to ask him about Babu’s defence before he started his examination-in-chief because the accused already knew Babu’s defence prior to the lock-up meeting, contrary to what is stated in Mr Revi Shanker’s written notes of the lock-up meeting. Furthermore, it was confirmed during the lock-up meeting that Babu’s defence remained that he had nothing to do with the drugs. The accused said he was aware of Babu’s defence of total non-involvement with the drugs as early as 2014 and until the date of the lock-up meeting on 3 April 2019, he knew that Babu’s defence remained unchanged because of Babu’s messages through other people, which were relayed to the accused. According to the accused: “Everywhere I go, for interviews or any places that I go to, people, random inmates, even special ward inmates walked up to me and tell me, ‘Why are you involving him in his, why don’t you take the rap and let him go?’ So I get this kind of messages quite often.”

The accused testified: “…all the inmates that belong to Babu’s SS [Secret Society] group would embarrass me inside ... saying that I was doing the work of a ghost and say humiliating things to embarrass me. They were pressuring---pressurising me to accept all responsibility and to make sure that I vindicate Babu from it and accept all blames for this drug case.”

</div> The accused said that he had even fought with the inmates who shared the same cell as Babu. The accused was frustrated because he ended up fighting with these people who came and disturbed him, asking him to let Babu off and nothing was being done about it by his previous counsel. When he told Mr Revi Shanker about it, Mr Revi Shanker would tell him there was nothing he could do as it was happening in the prison and the prison had to look into it.

Mr Tiwary said he had not told them that his client, Babu, would give evidence to say that he ordered one bundle of drugs or that if the accused did not assist Babu, then Babu would call at least five witnesses to give evidence at the trial that the accused had ordered the three bundles of drugs.   While Mr Tiwary claimed not to have told the accused’s previous counsel anything along those lines, he accepted that he had subpoenaed a number of witnesses (three in total) from Changi Prison for the accused to identify when the accused was being cross-examined by him.

Mr Tiwary explained that he was prepared at that stage to be upfront about his cross-examination because he knew that he was going to ask him very difficult questions, put things to him and basically do his job as best as he could. Mr Tiwary did not want to do it in a cloak and dagger manner and he did not want to hold it back and spring the accused a surprise.

Mr Johan and Mr Revi Shanker agree with the DPP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The Court of Appeal held that a two-step approach should be adopted for assessing claims by the appellant of inadequate legal assistance raised against the appellant’s previous trial counsel when seeking to overturn an appeal against conviction. The first step is to assess counsel’s conduct of the case and the second step is to assess whether the conduct affected the outcome of the case, in that it resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 For the first step, the court held at [135] to [137] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">135 An appellant <span class="font-italic">seeking to overturn his conviction on the basis that he did not receive adequate legal assistance</span> must show that the trial counsel’s conduct of the case fell so clearly below an objective standard of what a reasonable counsel would have done or would not have done in the particular circumstances of the case that the conduct could be fairly described as flagrant or egregious incompetence or indifference. In other words, the incompetence must be stark and glaring. Certainly, it will not be enough to show that some other counsel, especially eminent or experienced ones, would have taken a different approach or perhaps would have been more combative towards the Prosecution’s witnesses. As long as counsel, whether at trial or on appeal, are acting in accordance with their clients’ instructions, and in compliance with their duty to the court and their professional obligations, they must be given the deference and latitude in deciding how to conduct the case after studying all the evidence and the applicable law. Legitimate and reasonable strategic or tactical decisions do not come within the very narrow class of cases where inadequate assistance of counsel can be said to have occurred.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">136 These considerations apply equally to counsel’s conduct in the entire spectrum of his professional duties to his client in a criminal case – advising a client on whether to plead guilty or to claim trial, whether to accept an offer made as part of plea bargaining, on matters prior to and during trial and also on whether to appeal and the grounds for doing so. It must be remembered that allegations made against previous counsel could subsequently also be made against present counsel if the present counsel are not able to secure the desired outcome for the client. In this manner, such collateral attacks against court decisions could go on almost indefinitely. They are collateral attacks because they do not engage the merits of the court decisions on the evidence or the submissions made but seek to impugn the decisions indirectly by alleging that the court did not have the full evidence before it or was given wrong information because of inept counsel. The court must therefore be astute to ensure that its processes are not abused by incessant applications to retry or to re-open concluded matters by using such collateral attacks on court decisions through the device of complaints against previous counsel for alleged incompetence and/or indifference. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">137 Natural justice applies to the previous counsel of course and so, like anyone else accused of some wrong, he must be given notice of the allegations made against him and must have a reasonable opportunity to respond in writing and, where necessary, to attend and make submissions at the hearing where his conduct as counsel is an issue.  …. [I]t is incumbent on the client to particularise the alleged failure on the part of his former counsel and to persuade the court that there is a real point that warrants remittal to the trial court. If the court is satisfied that the client’s allegation against his former counsel has no substance in fact or does not meet the high threshold set out at [134]–[136] above, there will be no reason at all to exercise its power under s 392 of the CPC.    </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">149 For the second step, the court held at [138]–[139] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">138 If inadequate legal assistance from previous counsel is proved under the first step in the inquiry, the second step is to show that there is a nexus between the counsel’s conduct of the case and the court’s decision in the matter in order to demonstrate a case of miscarriage of justice. The suggested standard required to show miscarriage of justice included “reasonable possibility” and “real possibility”. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">139 … Our present situation involves an appellant contending on appeal that his trial counsel had failed him. As set out at [134]–[136] above, an appellant making such allegations against his former counsel has a high threshold to cross. We think therefore that we need only to adopt the standard of “real possibility” in s 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for such an appellant to meet in order to satisfy the court at the second step of the inquiry. An appellant who has established a case of inadequate legal assistance from his previous counsel must therefore also show that there is a real possibility that such inadequate assistance has caused a miscarriage of justice on the particular facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The DPP submits that the above legal principles, and caution, laid down in the context of an appellant seeking to overturn his conviction on appeal are similarly applicable in cases such as this case, where the accused is now trying to rely on alleged inadequate legal assistance to: (a) be allowed to recall several Prosecution witnesses; and (b) have a “do-over” at giving evidence-in-chief in the main trial.

</div> According to the DPP, the accused is essentially asserting that inadequate representation by <span class="font-italic">Farid</span>’s standards, even if it did not impact the conduct of the case in court such as to result in any miscarriage of justice, is enough to allow him, “in the parlance of golf, to take a mulligan.”

</div> The DPP submits that either <span class="font-italic">Farid</span> is applicable in its entirely, or it is not. The second stage – an assessment of whether there was a miscarriage of justice – flows naturally from the findings of the court in the first stage. If there is no need to find a miscarriage of justice, then one must ask on what basis the accused is seeking a do-over of his evidence.

The calling of any evidence or witnesses after the close of the case <span class="font-italic">must</span> be based on the interests of justice. Section 283(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”) clearly states that the court must summon and examine or recall and re-examine such a person if it thinks the person’s evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case. Flowing from this, inadequate legal assistance must give rise to a real possibility of a miscarriage of justice to ground such an application.

His case has not closed yet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 At trial, the situation is frequently very fluid. Not every situation can be anticipated. There can be many genuine reasons why a party may apply to recall witnesses. I will give some examples:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Counsel may have forgotten to deal with certain evidence and later realises that he needs to recall certain witnesses to deal with them.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An accused person may not realise or appreciate the relevance of   certain evidence until much later. He then discloses them to counsel after his testimony is over. His counsel may decide to recall witnesses or the accused to testify.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Upon reviewing the case afresh, new counsel appointed may decide to adopt a different defence strategy, which then requires a different set of facts to be adduced as evidence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At trial, unexpected evidence may suddenly be uncovered. Witnesses may have to be recalled in relation to such evidence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Despite best efforts, counsel may not have fully taken all relevant instructions. After taking further instructions, gaps in the evidence may later be discovered, requiring a recall of witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) There is also the possibility of deficient or inadequate legal representation resulting in instructions not being followed and relevant evidence being omitted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Errors in earlier evidence may later be discovered, which would require witnesses to be recalled for clarification and correction of those errors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Witnesses may have to be recalled to elaborate on and clarify aspects of their evidence which appear to be inaccurate as a result of the testimony of other witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Certainly, when counsel and the accused work together to engineer a false reason grounded on false facts in order to justify a recall of a witness or witnesses, it will amount to an abuse of process and the application for recall should be disallowed. That is quite apart from other consequences that may follow. But I do not think that there should be an extensive ancillary hearing (as has happened in the present case) each and every time to ascertain the truth of those reasons just to be absolutely sure that they are genuine. I do not think it is necessary to do so. It is for the trial judge to probe and assess the situation. Unless there are good reasons to suspect that the reasons provided are untrue and therefore that the applicant may be abusing the process of the court, the trial judge may proceed to allow the application pursuant to s 283 of the CPC <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">if he </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">thinks</span> that the evidence proposed to be adduced through the recalled witnesses is relevant. The principal governing question is therefore whether the evidence to be adduced through the recalled witnesses is going to be relevant. There is no necessity for the applicant to prove at this stage that the evidence will <span class="font-italic">definitely</span> be relevant. It is sufficient that the applicant through his counsel explains the gist of the evidence that will be led to satisfy the court that the evidence, if led by recalling the witness, has some relevance to the issues at the trial. If it actually turns out that the evidence given is not relevant, no harm is caused as the court, when finally deciding on the matter at the conclusion of the trial, can simply ignore that irrelevant evidence. It must be recognised that before the whole case is over, the court may not always be able to know for certain whether the further evidence proposed to be adduced is relevant or not. In the early stages of the trial and before the accused has given his defence, it may not always be clear what is going to be relevant. Under these circumstances, it may be better to err on the side of caution, rely on counsel’s good judgment that it is relevant, and allow the further evidence to be given first since the court is unsure of its relevance. If irrelevant, the further evidence can simply be disregarded when the court is making its decision. The only downside is that some extra time would inevitably be expended for the hearing. But the risk of injustice or a mistrial will be minimised. It is preferable to adopt a flexible and pragmatic approach which best ensures a fair trial so that relevant admissible evidence is not inadvertently shut out of the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 I note in this case that the accused’s complaints surfaced suddenly whilst the accused was being cross-examined by Mr Tiwary. He was unrepresented at that time. When Mr Hassan and Ms Chitra, his new counsel, were able to obtain instructions from the accused, it was after the completion of his cross-examination. His re-examination had not started. The accused’s case had not closed. Neither did Mr Hassan delay informing the court that the accused had certain complaints against his previous counsel. Mr Hassan wanted to recall certain witnesses of the Prosecution for further cross-examination and have the accused give further evidence-in-chief to admit into evidence, amongst other things, his handwritten statement. Due to the DPP’s objections on the basis of <span class="font-italic">Farid</span>, a long ancillary hearing ensued.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 I will now deal with the factual evidence adduced at the ancillary hearing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accused’s handwritten statement dated 3 March 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 I find it difficult to decide which of the two versions is closer to the truth: the accused’s version that his previous counsel failed to follow his instructions to admit his handwritten statement or the previous counsel’s version that no such instructions were given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The handwritten statement given by the accused to Mr Tiwary which states that Babu was innocent, and that the accused was induced and threatened by the CNB officers to falsely implicate Babu is, in my opinion, likely to be made at the behest of Babu based on what Babu told the accused to write. I note of course that no one called Babu as a witness to give his version of the events in this ancillary hearing. However, given the available evidence before me, I believe the accused on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 What is clear to me is that the accused had a lot of discussions, and perhaps even arguments, with his previous counsel on what is to be done with the handwritten statement. Those discussions probably revolved around whether the handwritten statement should be admitted or not. I am inclined to believe that after the DPP and Mr Tiwary confirmed that they were not using the handwritten statement, the accused was probably persuaded eventually by his previous counsel not to admit the handwritten statement, although the accused initially wanted his handwritten statement to be admitted into evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Since then, unforeseen developments have arisen. The Prosecution called the co-accused, Babu, as a rebuttal witness in the main trial after Babu pleaded guilty mid-way though the joint trial.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Clearly, Babu’s evidence, if accepted, will completely demolish the accused’s defence that he only expected one bundle to arrive (see [62] above) (the “one bundle defence”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 After Babu had completed his evidence-in-chief, Mr Hassan informed me that he was not ready to cross-examine Babu and to date, Babu’s cross-examination has not begun.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In my view, even if the accused’s handwritten statement may not have been particularly relevant to the defence <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to Babu being called as a rebuttal witness, now that Babu has given very incriminating evidence against the accused by directly contradicting the accused’s one bundle defence, I am of the view that (a) the accused’s handwritten statement being penned at the behest of Babu and written in the way that Babu wanted; and (b) the evidence of various steps taken by Babu to persuade the accused to lie and exonerate him, have become crucially relevant to the accused’s overall defence to show not only a lack of credibility on the part of Babu but also that Babu had even tried to suborn the accused, who is no doubt an important witness at the joint trial.  Furthermore, the fact that Babu failed to stop the accused from incriminating him may lead to a line of cross-examination by the accused’s new counsel on Babu’s credibility, and importantly on whether Babu is now lying in his evidence to exact revenge on the accused for refusing to co-operate and exonerate him. To disallow the admission of the accused’s handwritten statement as well as evidence of the circumstances leading to the creation of that handwritten statement will, in my view, prejudice the accused’s defence as Mr Hassan will be impeded in his cross-examination of Babu to rebut Babu’s incriminating evidence against the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 As a point of principle and in fairness, a trial court should allow all evidence which it thinks is relevant to making a just decision, especially evidence which is material in nature, to be admitted into evidence, even if this has to be done by way of a recall of witnesses (including the accused) very late during the trial stage. This is in any event allowed (and even mandated where the evidence is <span class="font-italic">essential</span> to making a just decision) under s 283 of the CPC, which states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power of court to summon and examine persons</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">283.</span>—(1)  A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code, summon a person as a witness or examine a person in attendance as a witness, whether or not summoned, or recall and re‑examine a person already examined.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The court must summon and examine or recall and re‑examine such a person if it thinks the person’s evidence is essential to making a just decision in the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The exercise by a court of its power under subsection (1) is not a ground for appeal, or for revision, unless the appellant or the applicant (as the case may be) shows that the examination has led to a failure of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In my view, it will not be conducive to making a just decision on the unusual facts of this case to refuse Mr Hassan’s application to recall the accused to give further evidence-in-chief of the events leading to the creation of the accused’s handwritten statement and to admit the accused’s handwritten statement for the purposes of the main trial. Further, it will also not be conducive to making a just decision to disallow the accused from giving further evidence-in-chief of all the other various measures taken by Babu (one of which I set out below at [218] to [221]) to induce and pressure the accused to exonerate him at the trial. The accused’s evidence-in-chief of those measures taken by Babu will provide an evidential basis for Babu’s cross-examination later on, especially on Babu’s reliability as a rebuttal witness and on whether Babu is now giving false evidence to destroy the accused’s one bundle defence out of vengeance because the accused had given evidence at the main trial incriminating him as the one who ordered the drugs. The above evidence proposed by Mr Hassan to be adduced through the recall of certain witnesses appear to be highly relevant to the accused’s case and should be allowed into evidence as part of the main trial.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Babu arranged for Mr Bachoo Mohan Singh (“Mr Bachoo Mohan”) to interview the accused in prison </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 One of those measures taken by Babu to pressure the accused to exonerate him at the trial appears to be instructing Mr Bachoo Mohan (via intermediaries) and paying his fees for him to interview the accused with a view to representing the accused if he should agree to exonerate Babu at the trial.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Because when I tell you, Mr Johan, some things, you don’t seem to like it. And when I---and then you will turn around and tell me, ‘I’m your lawyer. You listen to me; I don’t have to listen to you.’ When you tell me this, I get frighten. And within me, I have this confusion, ‘He’s my lawyer, he’s supposed to act for me. And if he tells me such a thing, what am I supposed to do?’ As far as I’m concerned, every time I open my mouth to say something, you throw your tantrums and scold me. You yourself know that.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 I believe the accused that despite his difficulties in giving his instructions to Mr Johan, he was afraid to discharge Mr Johan and Mr Revi Shanker because he already had numerous changes of counsel. He was worried that he might end up having to represent himself in the capital trial. However, it turns out that it was Mr Johan and Mr Revi Shanker who discharged themselves from acting for the accused whilst the accused was in the midst of being cross-examined by Mr Tiwary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 In my view, the accused’s difficulties in communicating his instructions to Mr Johan (which he expected Mr Johan to follow), whether these difficulties were due to (a) a personality clash; (b) overbearing conduct on Mr Johan’s part; (c) Mr Johan’s dismissive attitude towards the accused with regard to what the accused wanted to be done; or (d) Mr Johan’s insistence that the accused must always listen to him as he is the accused’s lawyer, are indeed a genuine cause for concern. In light of the frequent fights and arguments between the accused and Mr Johan when the accused was giving his instructions to Mr Johan, there is a real risk of the accused being intimidated and inhibited when giving his instructions. This is another reason why I am allowing the application of Mr Hassan to recall certain Prosecution witnesses, who were earlier cross-examined by Mr Johan. Hopefully, this will be sufficient to remedy the situation and avoid the risk of injustice to the accused in this ongoing trial.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accused’s depression affecting the accused’s state of mind</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 I believe the accused that he suffered from depression at the material time and was taking medication. His depression was precipitated by the news he received that his girlfriend was having an affair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 With the accused’s depression, it is not surprising that he was not in the right frame of mind. That affected how he conducted himself, for instance: (a) in changing his position a few times on who in fact ordered the drugs, which may have an impact on his credibility generally and perhaps also on whether the court will believe his one bundle defence; and (b) in making a handwritten statement which was not true and which exonerated Babu completely based on what Babu had told him to say, and handing that handwritten statement over to Mr Tiwary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 Some leeway must therefore be given to the accused because the accused might not have had the opportunity to instruct his counsel properly and comprehensively at the material time, given his depression and the pressures he was labouring under.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Therefore, if new counsel for the accused apply for a recall of the accused and certain Prosecution witnesses to cover areas which were not previously canvassed during the main trial, I will be slow to refuse the new counsel’s application. I cannot see any abuse of the court’s process if the application for recall is allowed under the circumstances. Rather it would be an injustice and a prejudice occasioned to the accused at trial if the new counsel’s application for recall is denied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Audio recording and the transcript evidencing misconduct and improper legal advice  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In the audio recording (which has been transcribed and translated as parts of the conversation were in Tamil and Malay), Mr Revi Shanker can be heard telling Ms Kavitha and Ms Siroshini that if the accused cooperates by saying that the accused ordered the drugs from “Boy”, then Babu can support the accused.

At para 25 of Mr Revi Shanker’s affidavit, he states that he agrees with para 27 of Mr Johan’s affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 Having regard to the portions of the transcript of the audio recording that I have set out in detail above, it is apparent that paras 25 and 27 of Mr Johan’s and Mr Revi Shanker’s affidavits are untrue. I believe the accused’s version of events that the accused was asked not to implicate Babu. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 I accept the submission of the accused that the undisputed audio transcripts evidence grave misconduct on the part of Mr Revi Shanker in advising the accused (quite inappropriately in my view) not to implicate Babu in order to save both the accused’s and Babu’s lives when the accused’s clear instructions were that Babu was involved in the drug transaction and that it was Babu who ordered the drugs from “Boy”. The audio transcripts essentially provide strong corroboration of the accused’s testimony that Mr Revi Shanker had told him not to implicate Babu.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257  I note that Mr Tiwary had arranged for some inmates from prison to be identified by the accused when he was under cross-examination by Mr Tiwary. Could these be the persons which Mr Tiwary intended to call to “support” the accused if the accused exonerated Babu or to “whack” the accused if the accused incriminated Babu, as referred to by Mr Revi Shanker in the portion of the audio transcript reproduced at [247] above?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 As the accused stood firm on his instructions, Mr Revi Shanker failed in his attempt to persuade the accused to adopt his trial strategy to save both the accused’s and Babu’s lives. That strategy involved the accused completely exonerating Babu through the accused’s evidence in exchange for the accused obtaining evidential support from witnesses to be called by Mr Tiwary for the accused’s defence that he ordered only one bundle from Boy. Mr Revi Shanker then led evidence-in-chief from the accused at the joint trial, which was along the lines of the accused’s defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the accused had an expectation of receiving only one bundle of drugs, but three bundles were delivered instead, and that Babu had told the accused that he ordered “a packet of heroin” and the accused was to collect that heroin for him

</div>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 On balance, I also believe the accused that Mr Revi Shanker had suggested to him to say that the CNB officers had induced him to implicate Babu in his statements to the CNB officers, which the accused said was untrue and was not his instructions to his previous counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 What is more important is whether there is any adverse impact resulting from the advice and suggestions which the accused has proved on a balance of probability to have been made to him by Mr Revi Shanker, which will make it necessary for the accused, now represented by new counsel, to (a) be given an opportunity to recall certain Prosecution witnesses for further cross-examination; and (b) be allowed another opportunity to give further evidence-in-chief on matters that were not alluded to previously by him in his evidence-in-chief led by Mr Revi Shanker.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 In my view, this has not directly impacted the accused’s defence because the accused had declined to follow Mr Revi Shanker’s advice and trial strategy of exonerating Babu and saving both the accused’s and Babu’s lives. However, I find that what Mr Revi Shanker did, not only added to those pressures exerted on the accused by Babu, but also affected the accused mentally and compounded the difficulties the accused faced in giving his instructions fully and properly to his previous counsel. It will be difficult to determine (and I do not wish to do so) what exactly was omitted in the cross-examination of the Prosecution witnesses and/or the accused’s evidence-in-chief, or what was not carried out by the accused’s previous counsel based on the many instructions of the accused given to his previous counsel over a long period of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 It suffices to say that a practical solution to resolve any potential adverse impact arising from any failure to follow the myriad instructions of the accused to his previous counsel, and to address the many complaints of the accused, is to allow the accused’s new counsel, Mr Hassan and Ms Chitra (who would presumably have properly taken a comprehensive set of instructions from the accused by now), to recall the necessary witnesses (including the accused) or call further witnesses based on those instructions when the main trial resumes.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 For the reasons I have stated, I allow the accused’s application to (a) recall certain Prosecution witnesses for further cross-examination; (b) give further evidence-in-chief in support of his defence; and (c) call additional witnesses (if any) to testify in his defence. The DPP is of course allowed to further re-examine those Prosecution witnesses recalled by the accused and further cross-examine the accused on his further evidence-in-chief. The additional witnesses (if any) called by the accused to testify will be subject to the usual cross-examination by the DPP and re-examination by the accused. The fresh evidence to be led must, as far as possible, not be a repeat what has been adduced as evidence earlier in the main trial. The additional evidence must of course be relevant and legally admissible.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 I reiterate that this case is not simply one of inadequate legal representation where, amongst other things, there was much difficulty faced by the accused in giving his instructions to Mr Johan and inappropriate advice was given to the accused to exonerate Babu contrary to the instructions of the accused. It also concerns Babu’s persistent and undue pressure on the accused to change his evidence to exonerate Babu. It also unfortunately involves pressure from the accused’s own previous counsel, Mr Revi Shanker, to accept his legal advice and trial strategy to save both Babu and the accused’s own life by testifying in court that the accused (and not Babu) had ordered the drugs. Mr Revi Shanker’s trial strategy also entailed the accused, in return for exonerating Babu, receiving evidential support for the accused’s own one bundle defence which would be forthcoming from Babu’s side, and which Mr Revi Shanker told the accused Mr Tiwary had given an assurance on. This case also involves the Prosecution’s calling of Babu as a rebuttal witness after Babu pleaded guilty. This event, which was not anticipated by the accused, now precipitates the need, from the accused’s perspective, to rebut Babu’s very damaging evidence by adducing additional evidence to demonstrate Babu’s lack of credibility and perhaps also to establish Babu’s desire for revenge.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Senior Judge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Terence Chua Seng Leng, Nicholas Wuan Kin Lek and Kwang Jia Min (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hassan Esa Almenoar (R Ramason &amp; Almenoar) and Balakrishnan Chitra (Regency Legal LLP) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
