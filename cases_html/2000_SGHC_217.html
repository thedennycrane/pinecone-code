<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 The Plaintiffs are a company

incorporated in Singapore and among their business activities was the import and sale of

steel reinforcement bars ("rebars") for reinforced concrete. The Defendants are

a company incorporated in Singapore and carry on business as building contractors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 In this action the Plaintiffs claim

against the Defendants the sum of $626,008.23 as damages for the Defendants’ failure

to perform 2 contracts for the purchase of rebars. The Plaintiffs claim that the

Defendants had failed to take delivery of the total quantities specified under the 2

contracts and they had to dispose of the undelivered balance by selling them to third

parties. The sum claimed represented the loss of revenue suffered by the Plaintiffs under

both contracts after accounting for the proceeds of the disposal sales. In their Defence,

the Defendants claimed that they were not obliged to take the quantities claimed for

various reasons, which I will go into later. The Defendants also counterclaimed against

the Plaintiffs for loss and expenses arising from the supply by the Plaintiffs of rusty

rebars. At the end of the trial and after hearing submissions by counsel, I gave judgment

for the Plaintiffs for the sum claimed and dismissed the Defendants’ counterclaim. I

ordered costs against the Defendants in respect of both the claim and the counterclaim.

The Defendants have since appealed against the whole of my order and I now give my grounds

of decision.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Plaintiffs’ claims</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The Plaintiffs claim under 2 contracts

as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) A contract in writing in the form of a

  letter from the Plaintiffs addressed to the Defendants, dated 26 February 1996 and

  entitled "Agreement for Supply of Reinforcement Bars" ("the First

  Contract"). This sets out the terms and conditions relating to the sale of 4,000

  tonnes of rebars. The Defendants’ Managing Director, Chai Chon Yen, placed his

  signature at the end of the document to signify his acceptance and confirmation on behalf

  of the Defendants. In this First Contract, the Plaintiffs put the reference number as

  LG960201.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) A contract in the form of a similar

  letter, dated 22 July 1996 ("the Second Contract"), in relation to 10,000

  tonnes. However this time the acceptance and confirmation at the end of the document is

  signed by the Defendants’ project manager for their Villa Marina project, Simon Ho

  ("Ho"). The Plaintiffs’ reference number in this Second Contract is stated

  as LG960705.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The Plaintiffs adopted the following

procedure in administering the 2 contracts. As and when orders were placed by the

Defendants’ site representatives, the Plaintiffs would deliver the rebars along with

the corresponding Delivery Orders ("DOs"). These DOs would contain an item

called "Sales Contract/P.O. No." and there, the reference number of either the

First Contract or the Second Contract would be entered. Next, the relevant invoices would

be sent to the Defendants. These invoices would cite the reference numbers of the First

Contract or Second Contract under an item called "Contract No." The

Plaintiffs’ case is essentially as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The Defendants had entered into the 2

  contracts which were binding on them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The contracts obliged the Defendants

  to purchase 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes respectively at the contractual prices.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) The Defendants had only purchased

  2,610.836 and 5,130.54 tonnes respectively under the First Contract and Second Contract

  and had refused to take the balance.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Defence</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 The Defendants’ have 5 alternative

defences as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) On a proper construction of the

  contracts, the quantities specified in both contracts were maximum quantities and the

  Defendants were not obliged to take the entire amounts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) While the Defendants agree that they

  had entered into the First Contract they deny that they had entered into the Second

  Contract. Ho, the signatory in the Second Contract, was not authorised to enter into such

  a contract on behalf of the Defendants and the Plaintiffs knew or ought to have known of

  this.<b> </b>Furthermore, as the Defendants had a flexible arrangement with the Plaintiffs

  in relation to project sites and they had taken a total of 7741.376 tonnes, this was well

  in excess of the 4,000 tonnes under the First Contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) The Second Contract was signed after

  the validity period of the offer and was therefore not valid.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) The Plaintiffs had committed a

  repudiatory breach of the contracts by supplying rusty rebars in September 1998 despite a

  warning given by the Defendants. The Defendants accepted this breach and ceased to make

  further orders of rebars.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) Time was not of the essence in both

  contracts and the Defendants could have completed purchasing the entire quantities if the

  Plaintiffs had not terminated the contract in January 1999.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Construction of the Contracts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 The first point is whether on a proper

construction of the contracts, the Defendants were obliged to take the quantities

specified, or whether these were merely maximum quantities under the contract that the

Plaintiffs were obliged to supply at the contractual prices.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 The First Contract is dated 26 February

1996 and drafted as a letter of offer. This was accepted and confirmed by the

Defendants’ Managing Director. This letter states as follows:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The Plaintiffs’ letter of 22 July

1997 sets out the terms of the Second Contract in a similar fashion. These terms are

exactly the same as those in the First Contract except for variations in the price (clause

3), total quantity (clause 6), delivery locations (clause 7), delivery mode and period

(clause 9), delivery details (clause 10), reservation of title provision (clause 12), and

validity period of offer (clause 15). As the material provisions in both contracts are the

same I need not set out the terms of the Second Contract in full.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 I now proceed to analyse the terms of

the First Contract. Clauses 1 and 2 identify the parties. Clause 3 sets out the price.

Clause 4 provides that the seller may decide the source country. Clause 5 states that the

price includes delivery at the site but not GST. Then comes clause 6 which provides as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"6. Total quantity for this Agreement

  is 4,000.000 MT"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There is nothing in the document which

specifically clarifies this. The Defendants say that this is at best ambiguous and

therefore must be interpreted <i>contra proferentem</i>. However I cannot agree. While the

interpretation of this provision might depend on what other provisions have to say about

this total quantity, I cannot see how there can be any ambiguity in the words of clause 6.

They must mean what they say, i.e. that the total quantity under the agreement is 4,000

tonnes. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 Moving on, clause 7 states that the

rebars are for use at a site at Havelock Road or "other projects as agreed" by

the Plaintiffs. Clause 8 specifies the standard that the rebars are to conform to and the

Defendants’ remedies and Plaintiffs’ liabilities should there be non-conformity.

Clause 9 provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"9. Commodities will be supplied by

  partial deliveries, within the contract period which commences from February 1996 and

  expires on January 1998."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The words "partial deliveries"

can only relate to the total quantity specified in clause 6. Therefore clause 9, read with

clause 6, shows that the Plaintiffs are obliged to supply and the Defendants to take the

4,000 tonnes between those 2 dates. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 Clause 10 sets out the conditions of

delivery such as minimum consignment size and site conditions. Clause 11 is a measurement

provision. Clause 12 states that the Defendants are to make payment within 30 days of

delivery of each consignment and that late payment will be subject to interest set at 2%

above the UOB prime rate. This clause also gives the Plaintiffs the right to determine the

contract if any payment is not made within the stipulate period. Clause 13 provides that

all duties or taxes levied, except for anti-dumping duty, shall be the liability of the

Defendants. Clause 14 is an entire agreement provision. Clause 15 limits the time for

acceptance of the offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 It can be seen that on a plain reading

of the First Contract it provides for the Defendants to purchase 4,000 tonnes of rebars

from the Plaintiffs at the price specified. Delivery would be effected in partial

quantities between February 1996 and January 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 The Defendants argue that clause 12 is

inconsistent with this interpretation. After specifying that the period for payment shall

be 30 days, clause 12 ends with this sentence:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">At the discretion of the Sellers, the

  Agreement is determinable upon non-payment of invoice beyond the stipulated payment

  period.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Defendants argued that if the contract

was for the entire 4,000 tonnes, then were the Defendants to be in breach of the payment

term in respect of the first consignment of say, 25 tonnes, then it would mean that the

Plaintiffs are entitled to terminate the contract and recover their loss of profits for

the balance 3,975 tonnes from the Defendants. Since that cannot be the position, it must

mean that the 4,000 tonnes only refers to the maximum quantity that the Plaintiffs are

obliged to supply to the Defendants at the contract price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 Even though I agree that the

consequences appear rather severe, I do not agree with this argument. Firstly, and as I

have stated above, the words are clear in clause 6, read in conjunction with clause 9,

that the total quantity for the contract is 4,000 tonnes. There is nothing in the rest of

the document to suggest that this relates to only the maximum quantity. Secondly the

second limb of clause 12 only gives the Plaintiffs the right to terminate the contract for

late payment. It does not provide the extent of Defendants’ liability upon such

determination. Indeed the Defendants’ point about the consequences being too harsh

can be used against any submission by the Plaintiffs in that situation to claim for loss

of profits in respect of the balance quantities. For the present purpose, I need not make

any determination as to this question.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 To support their position, the

Defendants cited my decision in Suit 803/99, <i>Nam Kee Asphalt Pte Ltd v Chew Eu Hock

Construction Co Pte Ltd</i> (unreported). That case involved a similar dispute as to

whether the quantities specified in the contract were maximum or minimum quantities. I

held that the quantities in that case related to the maximum quantities that the

plaintiffs were obliged to supply at the contractual prices and not the quantities that

the defendants were obliged to purchase. The main reason for that was the fact that the

written contract stated that the quantities were "estimated quantities". I had

also given 3 other reasons supporting this conclusion. One of these relates to the payment

term and paragraph 12(iii) of the judgment there reads as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(iii) Under "Payment

  Term", it is provided that if any invoice relating to any delivery is not paid on the

  due date the Plaintiffs may terminate the agreement immediately and recover such

  outstanding sum, plus legal costs, expenses and interest, from the Defendants. It does not

  provide that the Plaintiffs shall also be entitled to recover loss of profit from the

  balance quantity under the contract. If there had been an intention to oblige the

  Plaintiffs to take the entire quantity, it would have been logical and prudent to make

  provision for this here;"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Defendants point to clause 12 in the

present contract, which gives the right to the Plaintiffs to terminate the contract for

non-payment by the due date. They submit that this term gives a similar right to the

Plaintiffs and therefore the contract in the present case must relate to a maximum rather

than an quantity.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 I have discussed clause 12 above. In my

view the termination clause in <i>Nam Kee</i> is different because it provided expressly

for the amount the plaintiffs could recover in the event of non-payment of any invoice. My

reasoning in <i>Nam Kee</i> was that if there had been an intention to oblige the

defendants there to take the entire quantity, then it would have been logical for the

plaintiffs to specify that they would have been entitled to recover for loss of profits in

respect of the entire quantity rather than to specify only the recovery of the outstanding

amount under the invoice for a particular delivery. In the present case, the contract is

silent as to what the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover in the event of termination. It

should also be noted that the primary reason for the conclusion in <i>Nam Kee</i> was not

the clause relating to the payment term, but the fact that the contract specified that the

quantities were "estimated". In construing the obligations entered into by

parties to a contract, it is important to consider the exact terms in each case. It is

erroneous to point out a term common to another contract and from this, form a similar

conclusion. The question is what is the true nature of the bargain between the parties and

in the case of a written contract, the court has to distil this from the written terms in

their entirety. It is clear to me that the present case relates to a situation whereby the

purchaser had locked in a fixed price for certain quantities he required for his projects

over a period of time. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 As the material provisions of the

Second Contract are similar to those of the First Contract, the same conclusions obtains,

i.e. that the Defendants are obliged to purchase the entire quantity of 10,000 tonnes of

rebars.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Whether Second Contract validly made</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 I turn to the next limb of the defence,

i.e. whether the Second Contract is binding on the Defendants. This was signed by Ho, the

Defendants’ project manager at their Villa Marina site. The Defendants say that only

their directors were authorised to sign such a contract. Indeed the First Contract was

signed by Chai Choon Yen ("Chai"), their General Manager who, at the material

time was a director. There were also earlier contracts between the parties and these had

been signed either by Chai or another director, Leow.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 The Second Contract is dated 22 July

1996. The circumstances under which it was signed by Ho is somewhat hazy. Alvin Lim

("Lim") was the Plaintiffs’ Sales Manager at the time. He left the

Plaintiffs’ employment in November 1996 and at the time of the trial was working as a

sales agent for a trading company which also traded in rebars. Lim confirmed that one of

the signatures at bottom of the letter of 22 July 1996 was his. However he had no

recollection of the Second Contract. He confirmed that at the material time, he was the

only person from the Plaintiffs who dealt with the Defendants in relation to their rebar

contracts. For negotiation of contracts he normally dealt with Chai. For operational

matters such as complaints at site, he dealt with the respective project managers. There

had been contracts between the parties prior to these 2 contracts and Lim said that Chai

would usually sign the contracts on behalf of the Defendants. On occasions, Leow also

signed the contracts. He could not recall how Ho got to sign the Second Contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 On the other hand, the Defendants’

Ho recalled that after several batches of steel bars were delivered to his Villa Marina

site, 2 representatives of the Plaintiffs went to his site office and asked him to sign

the Second Contract. They told him that Chai had approved its terms and that Ho’s

signature was a mere formality for administration purposes. It was on this basis that he

put his signature on the document. Ho said that this was the first time that he had signed

such a major contract. He could not recall the identities of the 2 representatives, except

that it was a lady and a gentleman. When asked why he did not check with Chai when they

told him that the latter had approved the contract, Ho said that he tried to but was

unable to contact Chai and later found out that Chai was overseas at the time. Ho said

that Chai had earlier told him that he, Chai, had firmed up the unit rates with the

Plaintiffs and that Ho could order from them. Ho said that at the time he needed the

rebars urgently. However Ho said that he did not subsequently speak to Chai about his

signing the Second Contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 Chai gave evidence that sometime in

July 1996, Lim came to his office with 2 copies of a contract which he exhibited in his

affidavit. This is a letter dated 22 July 1996 ("the First Draft") and is

exactly the same as the Second Contract except for the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Under clause 9, the contract period is

  August 1996 to March 1998 in the First Draft and September 1996 to August 1998 in the

  Second Contract;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Under clause 15, the date for

  acceptance is 26 July 1996 in the First Draft and 1 August in the Second Contract.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 Chai said that he told Lim that the

quantity was too large and the Defendants only needed about 7,600 tonnes for the Villa

Marina project. Therefore he did not sign the First Draft although Lim tried to persuade

him to do so. Chai said that they eventually agreed that the Defendants would purchase

rebars from the Plaintiffs on an ad-hoc basis at $482 per tonne, the price specified in

the First Draft.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 On the face of it, the Defendants

appear to have a good defence. After all, the course of dealing was that contracts were

signed by the directors Chai or Leow. Ho was only the project manager who had charge of

the Villa Marina site and had neither actual nor ostensible authority to enter into such a

large contract. However the problem with the Defendants’ case is that the subsequent

facts do not support it. These are as follows:</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Part performance of contract</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 After the Second Contract was signed,

the Plaintiffs delivered a total of 5,130.54 tonnes to the Villa Marina or other sites.

Each delivery was accompanied by a Delivery Order which cited the reference number of the

Second Contract. Payment was made by the Defendants against invoices which also cited the

reference number. The Defendants explained that those orders they made were pursuant to

the ad hoc agreement and they did not pay attention to the reference number.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(<u>ii) Defendants agreed to variation of

contract</u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 Sometime in 1997 the prices of rebars

in the market fell. The Defendants asked the Plaintiffs for a reduction in the prices of

the rebars. After a discussion on 10 September 1997, the Plaintiffs agreed to reduce the

basic price from $482 per tonne to $472. To confirm this they sent 2 letters to the

Defendants, both dated 11 September 1997. The first letter made reference to the First

Contract and states as follows:</font></p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27 Both letters were signed by Chai, on

behalf of the Defendants, under the heading <i>"Confirmed and accepted by"</i>.

Chai explained that at the time he signed these documents he did not pay attention to the

fact that the second letter made reference to the Second Contract. He thought it was

simply a reduction in price offered by the Plaintiffs in respect of their ad hoc orders

for rebars. However the letters, on their faces, are clear enough. They are 2 separate

letters, with their respective reference numbers and specify different project sites. They

make reference to a discussion on 10 September 1997 and state that the <i>"above-mentioned

contract"</i> would be amended. Then the contract terms that are amended are set out

in full. Both letters finish off with a statement that the other terms and conditions

remain unchanged. Last but not least, both letters conclude with a crucial piece of

information: the balance quantities for each contract. In particular, the letter in

respect of the Second Contract states that the balance quantity for this was 9,900 tonnes.

Chai had given evidence that he could not have agreed to entering into the Second Contract

which called for 10,000 tonnes because he only required 7,000 tonnes for the Villa Marina

site. So the 9,900 tonnes stated in the letter would have sounded alarm bells in his mind.

For Chai to be able to say that he did not realise that these letters related to the First

Contract and Second Contract, he would have to say that he signed the documents blindly

and did not read them at all.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28 Another of the Defendants’

directors was Chai Choon Peow ("C.P. Chai"). He gave evidence of a meeting in

mid-1998 with the Plaintiffs’ representatives in which he complained about the rusty

rebars being supplied by the Plaintiffs. He said that the Plaintiffs gave him a discount

for the defective rebars and an assurance in respect of future deliveries. C.P. Chai said

that he made it clear to the Plaintiffs that if they were unable to deliver acceptable

rebars he would cease all orders from them. However the rebars delivered after that

continued to be defective and he therefore ceased ordering from the Plaintiffs. The

Plaintiffs wrote a letter to the Defendants dated 23 November 1998 in the following terms:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29 C.P. Chai said that he drafted a reply

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35 The last point is the question of the

demeanour of the witnesses. The principal witnesses in respect of this issue were Chai and

Ho. I find Chai to be a person who was generally earnest in the witness box, but when it

came to the crucial question of his knowledge of the Second Contract, he displayed much

discomfort. As for Ho, although his demeanour was satisfactory, his version of how he came

to sign the Second Contract can only be believed if he were a simpleton. Unlike Chai, Ho

speaks and reads English and the essential terms are clearly set out in the document. It

is incredible that he would just accept the words of two persons whom he had never met

before. Furthermore, Ho contradicted himself on the question whether he checked with Chai.

In his affidavit evidence-in-chief, he said that he was unable to check with Chai at the

time because the latter was overseas. But in cross-examination Ho said that it was not

necessary to tell Chai about it because he was under the impression that Chai knew of it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) Conclusion</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36 In the premises, I concluded that Chai

was aware of the Second Contract and the obligations of the Defendants under it to

purchase 10,000 tonnes of rebars. I therefore found that Ho had the Defendants’

authority to enter into the Second Contract. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Validity Period of offer</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37 Clause 15 of the Second Contract states

as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Failure of Buyers to sign and return

  this Agreement to Sellers on or before 1<sup>st</sup> August 1996 will render this

  Agreement null and void."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Although there is no evidence of the exact

date that Ho signed the Second Contract, the parties agree that it was after 1 August. The

Defendants submit that by operation of this provision, the Second Contract is null and

void.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38 The short answer to this submission is

that this is a provision that is capable of being waived by the Plaintiffs and they have

clearly done so. Another approach would be as follows. This clause is actually one in

which the Plaintiffs have undertaken to keep their offer open until 1 August 1996. The

Defendants' purported acceptance of the offer after that date is actually a fresh offer

which the Plaintiffs accepted by their conduct in subsequently accepting the

Defendants’ orders and making deliveries under the contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39 The Plaintiffs submit that the

Defendants are estopped from enforcing this provision. In view of the preceding analysis,

the Second Contract subsists and there is no question of estoppel. But if this is

available for the Defendants to rely on, certainly the conditions for such estoppel are

made out. After all, both parties have acted on the basis that this contract was valid for

about 2 years.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Repudiatory Breach</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40 The fourth defence is that the

Plaintiffs had breached the contracts by supplying rebars that were excessively rusty and

as a result of this, the Defendants terminated the contracts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41 The Defendants adduced evidence of

instances where their site staff had complained to the Plaintiffs that certain

consignments of rebars supplied were excessively rusty. This is not denied by the

Plaintiffs. However the Plaintiffs say that in appropriate instances they had given a

discount to the Defendants in respect of those consignments. These were evidenced by

Credit Notes which the Defendants did not deny. Therefore, the Plaintiffs argued, the

Defendants had accepted those rebars in consideration of the discounts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42 Furthermore clause 8, which provides

for rejection of the rebars delivered, states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Commodities are in accordance with

  BS4449/1988 (Equivalent to SS2). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Copies of mill's test certificates, in

  which the results of testing in compliance with the aforesaid standard are stated, will be

  forwarded to Buyers upon request.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">If Buyers require verification of the

  commodities' quality, Buyers should conduct sampling tests BEFORE cutting, bending or

  processing of the commodities. Upon non-conformity proved by valid tests conducted in

  Government approved laboratories, Sellers will remove and replace those non-processed bars

  only. The liability of Sellers is limited to the transportation cost. Sellers will not be

  responsible for any other consequential damages."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In accordance with this provision, in

respect of any consignment that did not meet the specifications, the Plaintiffs were only

obliged to remove and replace the rebars. The Defendants did not adduce any evidence that

they had rejected any consignment and asked the Plaintiffs to replace it. Therefore the

Defendants have not proven any breach of contract by the Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43 In any event, there is the question

whether the contracts were terminated. There is no letter of termination. The Defendants

relied on a meeting between their director, C.P. Chai and the Plaintiffs’ director

Kenneth Wong ("Wong") in mid-1998. C.P. Chai said that he told Wong at that

meeting that the rebars being supplied were excessively rusty and that the Defendants

would terminate the contract if the situation did not improve. The Plaintiffs dispute that

such a meeting took place. But even if it did, the Plaintiffs say that there was no act of

termination. The Defendants say that this is evidenced by the fact that the Defendants did

not order any further quantities of rebars from the Plaintiffs. The problem with this

argument is that again, it is not supported by the response of the Defendants to the

Plaintiffs’ letter of 22 September 1998 and to the subsequent letters from the

Plaintiffs’ solicitors. I have described these events above. The Defendants did not

say at that time that the contracts had been terminated at any stage.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44 Furthermore, the Plaintiffs deny that

such a meeting took place. Wong testified that he had only met C.P. Chai once, and that

was in August 1997 when he came to Singapore in order to sort out the problem they were

having with the Defendants who were not taking up sufficiently large quantities of rebars.

In this respect, Wong’s evidence is supported by Helen Lam, the Plaintiffs’

Administration Manager. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45 I found C.P. Chai not to be a witness

of truth. I arrived at this conclusion firstly from his demeanour on the witness stand.

This is corroborated by attempts to tilt the evidence in his favour. The first is his

allegation that he had drafted a letter in reply to the Plaintiffs’ letter of 23

November 1998, which I have described earlier. C.P. Chai exhibited a photocopy of that

letter on which he had scribbled a draft reply in Chinese. In his first Affidavit

Evidence-in-Chief, he said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… I was extremely disappointed

  in the Plaintiffs and proceeded to write a letter to them to communicate my

  dissatisfaction and termination of the contract. I drafted this letter in Chinese …

  for my secretary to rewrite in English However, inadvertantly, this letter was not written

  or sent to the Plaintiffs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This gives the impression that he had

intended for his secretary to translate the letter into English and print it out for him

to sign. This is reinforced by his statement that he wanted to write to the Plaintiffs to

communicate <u>his</u> dissatisfaction. However in cross-examination, he said that the

letter was not addressed to him but to Chai, and that he had drafted <i>"some

information in Chinese for Chai Chon Yen to reply"</i>. When asked why he did not say

this in his Affidavit, he replied that he had forgotten to mention it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46 The second attempt by C.P. Chai to file

the evidence in his favour is in relation to his third Affidavit Evidence-in-Chief, in

which he claimed that he could not have met with Wong in August 1997 because he was not at

work. This was what he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I wish to clarify my whereabouts

  during the month of August 1997. Following a trip to Malaysia from 29 … 31 July 1997,

  I took a leave of absence from my duties as project director before leaving for Hong Kong

  on 5 August … until 8 August 1997. After the National Day holiday, I left for

  Malaysia on 10 August … and returned … on 11 August 1997, in time for my

  reservists in-camp training from 12 … - 25 August 1997. Following this, I took

  another leave of absence and only resumed duties on 1 September 1997. … Therefore, I

  did not personally attend to my duties as project director of the Defendants during the

  month of August 1997 in Singapore."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">C.P. Chai exhibited his passports to prove

his trips to Malaysia and Hong Kong and his SAF attendance booklet to show he had reported

for reservist duties on those dates. The problem with this is that he had conveniently

taken leave from work on all the other dates not accounted for in these documents. These

total 11 days, or 6 days if we exclude Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. When asked

whether he had any leave form to show that he had gone on leave on those days, he said

that there was none. He recalled that he was very tired after his reservist training and

took leave after that. When asked, he agreed that he was also very tired after he returned

from Malaysia on 31 July and went on leave until he departed for Hong Kong. It would

appear that for almost the entire month of August in 1997, C.P. Chai did not perform any

work on behalf of the Defendants, notwithstanding the fact that his reservist training was

only for a 2-week period. It is also noteworthy that on 1 September he felt that it was

time to get back to work. Or perhaps it was safe to do so, given that Wong had said that

the meeting took place sometime in August. Clearly this evidence is conveniently

structured to take care of this aspect of the Plaintiffs’ evidence but it is done in

a transparent manner that would fool nobody.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47 On the other hand, the 2 principal

witnesses for the Plaintiffs, Lam and Wong, were forthright and steadfast in the witness

box and their demeanour as well as the consistency of their evidence left me in no doubt

as to the veracity of their version of events. I therefore found that the meeting did not

take place in mid-1998 as C.P. Chai had alleged but in August 1997. As the allegations of

rust were only made in early 1998, there could not have been any question of there being

any threats to terminate the contracts in August 1997.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(v) Whether Time of the Essence</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48 The final defence is that time was not

of the essence in the contracts and that the Defendants could have completed purchasing

the entire quantities if the Plaintiffs had not terminated the contract in January 1999.

In a sense, it was the Defendants’ bad luck that the Plaintiffs had decided to wind

down their rebar trading business in Singapore. Had the Plaintiffs continued with the

business, there would have been a real possibility that the matter would have been

settled. But that does not affect the legal rights of the Plaintiffs. The sole issue

therefore is, the Defendants being in breach in not taking up the quantities within the

contract periods, were the Plaintiffs entitled to terminate the contracts under the

circumstances.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49 Under the terms of the contracts,

deliveries of the 4,000 tonnes under the First Contract were supposed to be made between

February 1996 and January 1998. This was later extended to March 1998. The 10,000 tonnes

under the Second Contract were to be delivered between September 1996 and August 1998. It

is true that it was not specified in both contracts that time was of the essence. On the

other hand, the Plaintiffs had been pressing the Defendants to take up rebars at a higher

rate in order to be able to perform the contracts. In fact, the 1997 meeting with C.P.

Chai for which Wong flew in from Hong Kong was mainly for this purpose. On 22 September

1998, Lam wrote to the Defendants to bring to their attention the fact that there was a

balance of more than 6,000 tonnes under the 2 contracts. She stated that the Plaintiffs

had <i>"locked in and reserved the quantity of steel bars under the … contracts

[and] the delay … had [caused] loss … in terms of commodity cost, exchange rate

and interest cost."</i> There followed some negotiation and exchange of

correspondence. The next significant document is the Defendants’ reply on 28 October

in which they gave reasons for not taking the quantities and ended with a statement that

they will try their <i>"very best to fully consume the contracted quantity"</i>.

However the situation did not improve and Lam wrote the final letter on 23 November 1998

in which she gave the Defendants until 30 November to revert with a <i>"schedule for</i>
<i>consumption of the balance quantity"</i>, failing which the Plaintiffs would

dispose of the balance and claim against the Defendants for losses. The Defendants did not

reply to this and on 7 January the Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to the Defendants,

again demanding the Defendants to draw on the balance within 7 days and make payment

within 30, failing which the Plaintiffs would sell the rebars and claim damages from the

Defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50 It should first be noted that there was

no offer by the Defendants to take the balance of the rebars. For the Defendants’

submission to succeed, they must be prepared to take the rebars even if it were on a later

date. There is also the question whether this would be a reasonable offer in this case

given that the rebars are perishable in that rust very soon sets in and reduces their

utility, as the Defendants had complained about. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs’ letter

of 28 October 1998 and their solicitors’ letter of 7 January 1999 would have been

sufficient in the circumstances to make time of the essence. And it is not even the

Defendants’ case that they had asked for more time. By their failure to indicate that

they were willing to perform, the Defendants have evinced an intention not to proceed with

the contracts. Accordingly, the Defendants’ failure to perform within the period

stipulated or the extension of time granted would constitute breaches of contract on their

part in relation to which the Plaintiffs would be entitled to terminate the contracts,

dispose of the balance quantities and recover the damages they had incurred from the

Defendants. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Damages</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51 The Plaintiffs have given evidence of

their losses and mitigation thereof which the Defendants did not seriously dispute.

Accordingly I accepted the evidence in this regard and gave judgment for the Plaintiffs in

the sum claimed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Counterclaim</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52 The Defendants allege that 25% of the

rebars supplied by the Plaintiffs were excessively rusty and that they incurred losses in

having to engage workers to remove the rust and having to place additional rebars as

instructed by the engineer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53 In relation to the quantity of rebars

that were affected by rust, the Defendants rely solely on an estimate by their project

managers on the site. Apart from some documents in respect of a few instances of rusty

bars, involving minuscule quantities, there is no documentary evidence to back this claim,

not even site notes or rejection letters. Obviously the project managers were not that

concerned with this issue at the time to have kept even the most rudimentary of records. I

have referred previously to clause 8 of the contracts which sets out the procedure for

rejection and the obligation of the Plaintiffs to replace such consignments. It would

follow that if the Defendants took any rusty consignment without protest or have

compromised it by obtaining a discount, they cannot subsequently complain about it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54 The Defendants say that they incurred

additional labour to rid the rebars of the rust. Again, there is no document supporting

this and the cost of labour to carry out such tasks are also the rough estimates of the

project managers. I must say that the quality of the evidence adduced by the Defendants in

respect of their counterclaim is so dismal that I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that

it is but a feeble attempt to go on the offensive in this suit. Accordingly I dismissed

the Defendants' counterclaim.</font></p>
