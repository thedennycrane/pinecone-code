<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These proceedings arise from horrific injuries
                    suffered by a workman who went into a coma, and involves his right, exercised
                    through his elder brother, to pursue his claim for damages at common law. It is
                    contended that his right to do so is barred because he opted for and obtained an
                    order for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Originating Summons No 265 of 2014 (“OS
                    265”) was filed on 21 March 2014 by Tan Lip Tiong Rodney (“Rodney
                    Tan”) as the court appointed deputy under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap
                    177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“Mental Capacity Act”) for Tan Yun Yeow
                    (“the Injured Employee”). Rodney Tan seeks to bring judicial
                    review proceedings under O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”) to quash the decision of the Commissioner of
                    Labour (“the Commissioner”) made on 2 January 2014 that the
                    Injured Employee had made a valid claim for compensation under the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Originating Summons No 918 of 2014 (“OS
                    918”), filed on 30 September 2014, is brought in the name of SBG
                    Starkstrom Pte Ltd (“the Employer”) by its insurer, MSIG Insurance
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The Employer seeks to bring judicial review proceedings to
                    quash a later decision of the Commissioner made on 1 July 2014 that the Injured
                    Employee had <em>not</em> made a valid claim for
                    compensation under the Act. The Employer also seeks a declaration that the
                    notice of assessment issued by the Commissioner dated 21 June 2010 (“the
                    Notice of Assessment”) was validly issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Counsel are agreed that these proceedings
                    involve the following issue: Whether a mentally incapacitated employee’s
                    next-of-kin, who has not been appointed a deputy under the Mental Capacity Act,
                    can nonetheless make a claim under the Act on behalf of that
                employee?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The facts in OS 265 and OS 918 are undisputed.
                    The Injured Employee was employed as an engineer by the Employer at the material
                    time. On 19 March 2009, the Injured Employee was involved in an electrical
                    explosion and slipped into a coma as a result.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Injured Employee suffered severe burns
                    involving his face, anterior trunk and bilateral upper limbs. The medical report
                    states that his treatment was complicated by multi-resistant acinetobacter
                    baumanii wound infection, septicaemia and septic shock. Kidney failure developed
                    which required renal replacement therapy from 26 March to 29 April 2009. Right
                    lower lobe pneumonia followed and he suffered respiratory arrest on 26 March
                    2009. Tracheostomy was performed on 29 April 2009. The Injured Employee was
                    comatose for slightly over a year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In April 2010, he was assessed as having a
                    reduced conscious level and able to only obey half commands and perform single
                    step commands. Although he is making slow progress, his residual cognitive
                    function is insufficient to benefit from intensive rehabilitation. He was
                    considered a mentally disordered person of unsound mind and incapable of
                    managing his financial and personal affairs by the Singapore General
                    Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       While the Injured Employee was in hospital, the
                    Employer filed an i-Notification under the Act on 26 March 2009 notifying the
                    Commissioner of the accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> A standard form letter was sent to the
                    Injured Employee on 2 April 2009 asking whether he wished to make a claim
                    under the Act. This letter enclosed an application form to be filled in and
                    returned in the event the Injured Employee wished to make a claim. On 11 June
                    2009, the Employer wrote to the Commissioner stating that the Injured Employee
                    was still hospitalised and had not regained consciousness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 22 January 2010, M/s Marican &amp; Associates
                    (“Marican”) wrote to the Commissioner to inform her that Marican
                    represented Rodney Tan, the brother of the Injured Employee, and that Rodney Tan
                    was given a power of attorney by the Injured Employee’s wife, Mdm Lim
                        Davy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I was informed
                    by counsel that the Injured Employee’s wife was from Vietnam, knew very
                    little English and hence left her eldest brother-in-law to deal with matters in
                    relation to her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 27 April 2010, the Commissioner received a
                    medical report from the Singapore General Hospital confirming that the Injured
                    Employee was of unsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his
                        affairs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The
                    Commissioner then sought confirmation from Marican as to whether the Injured
                    Employee’s next-of-kin wished to claim compensation under the Act on
                    behalf of the Injured Employee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Marican replied in a letter dated 20 May 2010
                    that “the next of kin … wishes to claim compensation for employee
                        [<em>sic</em>] under the [Act]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> (“the 20 May
                    2010 Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Based on the 20 May 2010 Letter, the
                    Commissioner issued the Notice of Assessment pursuant to s 24(2) of the Act and
                    addressed it to Marican by way of a letter dated 14 June 2010. The Commissioner
                    assessed that the Injured Employee was entitled to $225,000 in compensation, the
                    maximum sum allowed under the Third Schedule of the Act. In the letter dated 14
                    June 2010, the Commissioner noted that the Injured Employee was mentally
                    incapacitated, and that under the law, a person can only act for the injured
                    employee’s estate if he/she has obtained a court order for the Committee
                    of the Person and Estate of the injured employee. The Commissioner advised
                    Marican to apply for such a court order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner’s letter was
                    also accompanied by, amongst other documents, an “Authority to
                    Claim” form.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    The form requires the person claiming on behalf of the employee to declare that
                    he/she has been “appointed vide a Court Order … as the Committee
                    of the Person and Estate of [the injured employee]”. It bears noting that
                    although the Injured Employee’s claim was made after the one year
                    limitation period for making a claim under the Act, the Commissioner lifted the
                    limitation on the basis that there was a reasonable cause for the
                        delay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I pause here to note that when the Mental
                    Capacity Act came into force on 1 March 2010, the practice of appointing a
                    Committee of the Person and Estate under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act
                    (Cap 178, 1985 Rev Ed) to manage the personal welfare and financial matters of a
                    person who has become mentally incapacitated was replaced with that of
                    appointing a deputy under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In response to the Commissioner’s
                    letter, Marican wrote to the Commissioner on 23 June 2010 stating that the
                    Injured Employee lacked the capacity to make the decision whether to accept or
                    reject the compensation assessed by the Commissioner, and that Marican was
                    taking instructions from the Injured Employee’s next-of-kin. Marican also
                    requested that the Commissioner keep the Notice of Assessment in abeyance in
                    order to stop the time required under the Act to file an objection from
                        running.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner did not reply to this letter
                    as she was of the opinion that she had no express power under the Act to hold
                    the Notice of Assessment in abeyance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> However, as the Commissioner had
                    not received any forms from Marican, she sent a reminder on 12 November 2010
                    repeating what she stated in her letter of 14 June 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> There was no reply to
                    this letter from Marican.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Almost two years later, Rodney Tan was
                    appointed by the court as the deputy of the Injured Employee pursuant to the
                    Mental Capacity Act on 23 August 2012. The court order expressly conferred
                    authority on Rodney Tan to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     instruct lawyers to make such claim
                        against the Employer or such parties as Rodney Tan, on legal advice, deems
                        necessary and to commence legal proceedings under common
                    law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the common
                        law claim is withdrawn or dismissed, obtain such compensation as assessed by
                        the Commissioner or the court under the Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     give instructions to the Injured
                        Employee’s lawyers in respect of such a claim and to accept any
                        settlement that Rodney Tan considers reasonable as advised by lawyers
                        appointed by Rodney Tan; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     apply monies belonging to the Injured Employee from
                        whatever source including any compensation monies or damages to pay legal
                        fees and other related costs and expenses incurred for the purpose of making
                        the said claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Upon receiving a copy of the court order
                    appointing Rodney Tan as deputy, the Commissioner wrote to Marican on 29 October
                    2012 to check if Rodney Tan “wishes to claim compensation for the
                        deceased”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> According to the Commissioner, this choice of
                    words was a mistake on her part as she had intended to ask whether Rodney Tan
                    “wished to receive the compensation on behalf of the Injured
                        Employee”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I also note that although the Commissioner
                    referred to the Injured Employee as “the deceased” in her letter
                    dated 29 October 2012, the Injured Employee is still alive at the time of
                    this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At this point, Rodney Tan appeared to have
                    changed his mind about making a claim under the Act on behalf of the Injured
                    Employee. Marican replied to the Commissioner on 7 November 2012, stating
                    that they needed a copy of the Commissioner’s investigation report in
                    order to “consider whether to pursue [a claim] under [the
                        Act]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> On 28 February 2013, Marican wrote to the
                    Commissioner stating that the Injured Employee did not make an application for
                    compensation under the Act and that the Notice of Assessment was
                        invalid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner, however, was of the opinion
                    that the Notice of Assessment issued was valid and that it was not objected to
                    by the Injured Employee or his representative within the time limit required by
                    the Act. The Commissioner hence sent multiple letters to Marican requesting that
                    Rodney Tan provide certain bank details in order for the Commission of Labour to
                    disburse the compensation accordingly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 29 August 2013, Marican stated clearly to
                    the Commissioner that Rodney Tan had decided to claim compensation under the
                    common law on behalf of the Injured Employee, that he had never applied for
                    compensation under the Act, and that the Notice of Assessment was a nullity. On
                    24 September 2013, Rodney Tan commenced Suit No 851 of 2013 (“Suit
                    851”) for damages against three defendants, one of which is the
                    Employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     During this period of exchanges between
                    Marican and the Commissioner, the Employer laboured under the impression that a
                    valid claim was made. The Employer’s insurers had paid the sum of $225,000
                    as compensation under the Act to the Commission of Labour on 12 July 2010. As
                    far as the Employer was concerned, it was of the opinion that it had satisfied
                    its liability under the Act and that there would be no common law claim brought
                    by the Injured Employee or his representatives thereafter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The
                    Employer thus applied to strike out Suit 851 on 13 December 2013 on the basis
                    that a claim was already made under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 2 January 2014, the Commissioner wrote to
                    Marican stating that the 20 May 2010 Letter was a valid claim under s 11(1) of
                    the Act. The Notice of Assessment was also not objected to within the time
                    period required by the Act and therefore the Notice of Assessment was deemed to
                    be an order under the Act. She also added that since the claim was not withdrawn
                    within the requisite time, Rodney Tan might not be able to pursue a claim under
                    the common law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In response, Marican wrote to the Commissioner
                    on 27 February and 17 March 2014 requesting the Commissioner to agree that
                    Rodney Tan had never made a claim under the Act, failing which, Marican would
                    bring judicial review proceedings to quash the decision made by the
                        Commissioner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner did not reply
                    to Marican’s request and Marican brought OS 265 accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After seeking the advice of the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers (“the AGC”), the
                    Commissioner’s position changed. She wrote to Marican on
                    1 July 2014 stating that the Injured Employee had no capacity to make
                    a decision for himself in relation to his property and affairs at the time the
                    20 May 2010 Letter was sent. Hence, no valid claim for compensation was
                    made by the Injured Employee or on his behalf, and the Notice of Assessment was
                    a nullity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> This prompted the Employer’s lawyers to
                    write to the Commissioner on 21 July 2014 to disagree with the
                    Commissioner’s new position and to request the Commissioner to reconsider
                        it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    On 14 August 2014, the Commissioner replied the Employer, maintaining
                    her position as stated in her letter of 1 July 2014. The Employer then filed
                        OS 918.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The striking out application
                    that the Employer filed was stayed pending the determination of OS 265 and OS
                    918.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     By consent, the parties agreed at the
                    pre-trial conference on 4 February 2015 to conflate the issues of
                    leave and the substantive application under O 53 of the Rules of Court during
                    the hearing on 3 March 2015. Prior to the hearing, the parties also agreed for
                    both Originating Summonses to be heard together, with OS 918 to be heard
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel for the Employer, Mr Anparasan s/o
                    Kamachi (“Mr Anparasan”), contends that under the Act, a
                    next-of-kin does not need to be appointed as a deputy in order for him to make a
                    claim on behalf of an injured employee who has become mentally incapacitated. He
                    submits that the starting point is s 11(1) of the Act, which is the only
                    provision that makes reference to the making of a claim. Section 11(1)(<em>c</em>) provides that a claim shall be “made in such
                    form and manner as the Commissioner may determine”. This gives a
                    discretion exercisable by the Commissioner to decide whether a claim is validly
                    made or not, and this includes whether the claim was brought by the appropriate
                    person(s) on behalf of the employee. Mr Anparasan further submits that this
                    position is buttressed by first, the fact that there are other provisions in the
                    Act, such as s 12A, s 22(2), s 27(1)(<em>ba</em>) and
                    s 28A(2)(<em>c</em>), which provide for certain decisions
                    to be made on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee without the
                    appointment of a deputy, and secondly, the spirit of the Act, which is to
                    provide for a quick and straightforward manner for injured employees to claim
                    compensation. It would run contrary to the spirit of the Act if an injured
                    employee’s dependant had to commence further legal proceedings to be
                    appointed a deputy before he could make a claim on behalf of the injured
                    employee. Mr Anparasan’s position is that the Commissioner, in the
                    exercise of her discretion, had deemed the 20 May 2010 Letter to be a valid
                    claim made by the Injured Employee’s next-of-kin on behalf of the Injured
                    Employee. This discretion was properly exercised since on the face of it, Rodney
                    Tan had all the bearings of a proper claimant. Mr Anparasan submits that this
                    therefore constitutes a “claim” under the Act and the Notice of
                    Assessment is thereby validly issued. The Commissioner’s decision that the
                    Notice of Assessment is a nullity was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Counsel for the AGC, Mr Viveganandam Jesudevan
                    (“Mr Jesudevan”), does not dispute that the Commissioner assumed,
                    at the relevant time, that the 20 May 2010 Letter was a valid claim for
                    compensation under the Act. However, he submits that this assumption is a
                    jurisdictional error of fact. He argues that in order for a person to make a
                    claim under the Act on behalf of an injured employee, that person must have the
                    requisite legal capacity. This is the position embodied in the common law and
                    has not been abrogated by either the Act or the Mental Capacity Act. A
                    next-of-kin who has not been duly authorised by the court does not have the
                    requisite capacity to make such a claim under the Act. Mr Jesudevan also argues
                    that the position he advocates is supported by the purpose and scheme of the
                    Act. Thus, the Commissioner had come to the wrong conclusion in assuming that
                    Rodney Tan or Mdm Lim Davy had the requisite legal capacity on 20 May 2010 to
                    make a claim under the Act on behalf of the Injured Employee. Accordingly, the
                    Notice of Assessment issued by the Commissioner thereafter was issued in error
                    and is a nullity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As noted above, parties have agreed that the
                    single issue is whether the 20 May 2010 Letter is sufficient to constitute a
                    valid claim under the Act in the absence of any due authorisation for Rodney Tan
                    or Mdm Lim Davy to act on behalf of the mentally incapacitated Injured
                    Employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OS 918</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Before dealing with the parties’
                    submissions, I examine the relevant provisions under the Act. Section 11 of the
                    Act governs the procedural requirements for making a claim. The relevant
                    portions of s 11 provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Notice and
                        claim</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11.</b>—(1) Except as provided in this
                        section, proceedings for the recovery of compensation for an injury under
                        this Act shall not be maintainable unless —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) notice of the accident has been given to
                        the employer by or on behalf of the employee as soon as practicable after
                        the happening thereof;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) a claim for compensation with respect to
                        that accident has been made within one year from the happening of the
                        accident causing the injury, or, in the case of death, within one year from
                        the date of the death; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>c</em>) the claim has been made in such form and
                        manner as the Commissioner may determine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     When a valid claim is made under s 11, the
                    Commissioner is then empowered under s 24(1) of the Act to assess and make an
                    order on the amount of compensation payable to the employee. Upon doing so, the
                    Commissioner shall serve on the employer and the person claiming compensation a
                    notice of assessment of compensation, stating the amount of compensation payable
                    in accordance with the Commissioner’s assessment (see s 24(2) of the
                    Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 24(3) of the Act states that after the
                    notice of assessment is served, the parties may object to the notice within 14
                    days of its service. If no objection is received by the Commissioner within this
                    period, or if an objection is received but withdrawn within 28 days of the
                    service of the notice of assessment, the employer and the person claiming
                    compensation shall be deemed to have agreed to the notice. Section 24(3) also
                    provides that the notice is to have the effect of an order for the payment of
                    compensation made by the Commissioner under s 25D of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As is well known to practitioners in this
                    field, a key consequence of making a claim and receiving compensation under the
                    Act is the employee’s loss of his right to proceed with a claim under
                    common law. Section 33(2) of the Act provides that no action for damages shall
                    be maintainable by an employee against his employer in respect of any injury if,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, he makes a claim under the Act and
                    does not withdraw his claim within 28 days from the service of the notice of
                    assessment, or if he and his employer have agreed or are deemed to have agreed
                    to the notice of assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is undisputed that the Injured Employee
                    lacked the mental capacity at the relevant time to decide whether to make a
                    claim under the Act or pursue a claim at common law. From the exchanges between
                    the Commissioner and Marican leading up to the 20 May 2010 Letter, and the
                    exchanges shortly after, it is clear that by the 20 May 2010 Letter, Rodney Tan
                    or Mdm Lim Davy (whoever was the one instructing Marican) had <em>elected</em> to make a claim under the Act on behalf of the Injured
                    Employee. However, whether they had the <em>capacity</em>
                    to do so at law at that point in time is another matter
                altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Act is silent on who has the requisite
                    capacity to make a claim under the Act on behalf of a mentally incapacitated
                    employee, <em>ie</em>, an employee who is unable to make a
                    decision whether to make a claim under the Act because of an impairment of, or a
                    disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain (see s 4 of the Mental
                    Capacity Act). Section 11(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act
                    only deals with the form and manner in which a claim, or more accurately, the
                    election to make a claim, may be made. The Commissioner has a wide discretion to
                    accept different modes of election, for example, by way of email, by verbal
                    representations, or by letter. There is also no prescribed content as long as
                    the intention to elect to claim under the Act is sufficiently clear. It is clear
                    that s 11(1)(<em>c</em>) does not extend to granting the
                    Commissioner a discretion to determine who may make an election to claim under
                    the Act on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Anparasan submits that the Commissioner has
                    such a discretion and highlights certain provisions to show that such discretion
                    was envisaged by the Act. The first provision he relies on is s 22(2) of
                    the Act. Section 22(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where it appears to the Commissioner that compensation or interest is
                        payable to an employee under this Act and the employee is mentally
                        incapacitated before such payment is made, it shall be lawful for the
                        Commissioner to receive and pay the compensation or interest to any one or
                        more of the dependants of the employee for the benefit of the employee
                        without the appointment of any deputy for the employee under the Mental
                        Capacity Act 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     He contends that s 22(2) envisages a scenario
                    where a claim is made on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee without a
                    deputy being appointed. Otherwise a power would not be given to the Commissioner
                    to pay compensation to the employee’s dependents without the appointment
                    of any deputy. With respect, I am unable to agree. On a plain reading, s 22(2)
                    was meant to provide for a case where compensation or interest <em>is payable</em> under the Act, and the employee becomes
                    mentally incapacitated <em>after</em> he made a valid
                    claim, but before compensation is paid. The purpose of s 22(2) is thus to enable
                    the Commissioner to disburse the monies to the employee’s next-of-kin,
                    especially where the employee is in need of the funds for payment of medical or
                    other expenses, without undue delay and without having to wait for the
                    appointment of a deputy. The same concept can be seen in s 61 of the Insurance
                    Act (Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) where payment can be made by an insurer to any proper
                    claimant under a life or accident and health policy without the production of
                    any probate or letters of administration. From the clear words of the opening
                    sentence in s 22(2), there can be no implication that a claim under the Act may
                    be made on behalf of an employee who became mentally incapacitated without a
                    deputy being appointed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Anparasan also submits that the insertion
                    of s 22(2) into the Act, when read in the spirit of the Act, which he alleges is
                    to provide a quick and straightforward process for injured employees to make a
                    claim for compensation, shows that Parliament intended for a next-of-kin to be
                    able to make a claim on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee without
                    having to apply to be a deputy under the Mental Capacity Act. However, the exact
                    opposite may be said about the insertion of s 22(2) into the Act. The fact that
                    Parliament had not made such a similar amendment to s 11 of the Act or the
                    claims process indicates its intention <em>not</em> to
                    extend the dispensation of an appointed deputy with respect to who may make a
                    claim on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee. Unfortunately, the
                    parliamentary debates do not reveal much about the reasons for the introduction
                    of s 22(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Another provision Mr Anparasan relies upon is
                    s 12A of the Act. Section 12A(1) begins with: “[w]here any claim for
                    compensation has been made under this Act by an employee or <em>by a person acting on behalf of an employee who is dead or mentally
                        incapacitated</em>” [emphasis added]. Mr Anparasan argues that
                    by not using the term “deputy”, this indicates that the Act
                    envisages claims being made on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee
                    without a deputy being appointed. I note there are other provisions which make
                    an express reference to the term “deputy”, such as s
                        27(1)(<em>ba</em>) and s 28A(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Act, whereas s 12A(1) does not. However, I do not
                    accept that just because there are other provisions in the Act which use the
                    term “deputy”, Parliament intended the phrase “by a person
                    acting on behalf of an employee” to mean persons other than a deputy.
                    Provisions like s 12A(1), s 27(1)(<em>ba</em>) and s
                        28A(2)(<em>c</em>) are neutral at best with regards to
                    the question of whether a claim may be made on behalf of a mentally
                    incapacitated employee by persons other than a deputy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Mr Jesudevan relies on the Court of Appeal
                    case of <em>Teo Gim Tiong v Krishnasamy Pushpavathi (legal
                        representative of the estate of Maran s/o Kannakasabai, deceased)</em>
                    [2014] 4 SLR 15 (“<em>Teo Gim Tiong</em>”).
                    In <em>Teo Gim Tiong</em>, the plaintiff sustained injuries
                    in an accident and sued the defendant. The defendant made an offer to settle
                    which remained open for acceptance when the plaintiff passed away from his
                    injuries. The plaintiff’s mother then obtained an order of court to be
                    made a party to the proceedings as the legal representative of the
                    plaintiff’s estate under O 15 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court, and purported
                    to accept the defendant’s offer to settle. The issue on appeal was whether
                    the plaintiff’s mother had the capacity to act for the estate of the
                    plaintiff to accept the offer to settle. The Court of Appeal held at
                    [19]–[20] that as the action had been pursued as an estate claim for
                    damages under a cause of action that survived death under s 10(1) of the Civil
                    Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), only the proper appointed executor or
                    administrator of the estate could act for the estate. The plaintiff’s
                    mother therefore did not have the capacity to accept the offer to settle on
                    behalf of the estate because she had not been granted letters of administration.
                    At [31], the Court of Appeal held that the rationale is that “[i]n cases
                    of intestacy, the court jealously guards the assets – including causes of
                    action – of the deceased’s estate through the procedure by which
                    letters of administration are granted”. Hence, only persons who have been
                    granted letters of administration can act on behalf of a deceased’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This rationale is axiomatic. Capacity, be it
                    legal or mental competence, is an often unsung but self-evident concept that
                    underlies much of our law. It is the basis on which we view responsibility and
                    liability for, as well as the validity of, certain acts. In the context of
                    criminal law, the lack of mental capacity or understanding in appropriate cases
                    negatives <em>mens rea</em>. Hence the insane or those with
                    diminished mental capacity cannot be guilty of murder. By the same token,
                    children under the age of 7 are presumed not to have the capacity to commit
                    crimes and those between the ages of 7 to 12 who have not attained sufficient
                    maturity or understanding to judge the nature and consequences of their conduct
                    are not held criminally responsible for their acts. In the law of contract,
                    generally speaking, those under the age of 18 lack the legal capacity to enter
                    into contracts except for contracts for necessaries or training or analogous
                    contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     These considerations also arise where an adult
                    loses his mental faculties or suffers a diminution in mental capacity to the
                    point where he cannot be said to be of sound mind and capable of making a
                    decision affecting his affairs or giving a valid consent. As <em>Teo Gim Tiong</em> illustrates, the law is careful to scrutinise that
                    when A does something on behalf of B or his estate, A has satisfied the legal
                    requirements to do so, <em>ie</em>, a person must have the
                    requisite legal capacity before he/she can make a decision on behalf of another.
                    Similarly, legal capacity in relation to legal proceedings is governed by O 76 r
                    2 of the Rules of Court which provides that where a person is under
                    “disability”, only his litigation representative has the capacity
                    to bring, make a claim in, defend, make a counterclaim in, or intervene in any
                    proceedings, or appear in any proceedings under a judgment or order, notice of
                    which has been served on the mentally incapacitated person. The meaning of a
                    person under “disability” under O 76 of the Rules of Court
                    includes a person lacking capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the case of this Injured Employee, the
                    informed choice to be made was whether to proceed under the Act or under common
                    law. The plight of this Injured Employee brings into stark relief the
                    consequences of a wrong choice. The Commissioner has assessed and made an award
                    of the sum of $225,000, the maximum under the Act. In the statement of claim in
                    Suit 851, the medical expenses incurred up to the date of the writ, 24 September
                    2013, amounted to $523,504.91, transport expenses were estimated at $8,083.85,
                    legal costs for an Order under the Mental Capacity Act came to $7,831.00 and
                    pre-trial nursing care up to 3 August 2013 amounted to $27,150.63. Pre-trial
                    loss of earnings, loss of future earnings and/or loss of earning capacity, cost
                    of future medical costs, nursing care and transport were to be assessed. The
                    Injured Employee was 30 years old at the time of the accident. His common law
                    claim will be far in excess of the Commissioner’s award. There can be but
                    few choices which are of greater import than a decision whether to proceed under
                    the Act or common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is beyond doubt that this Injured Employee
                    lacked the mental capacity and competence to make such a choice right from the
                    time of the accident. Just as the court in <em>Teo Gim
                        Tiong</em> stated that the courts will jealously guard the assets,
                    including causes of action, of an intestate estate through the procedure by
                    which letters of administration are granted to proper legal representatives, the
                    courts will also jealously guard the rights of injured workers who lack the
                    mental capacity and competence to make choices that are in their best interests
                    by making sure fit and proper persons are appointed as their deputy under the
                    Mental Capacity Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There is a procedure under the Mental Capacity
                    Act for fit and proper persons to be appointed a deputy and to represent the
                    injured employee. The Mental Capacity Act imposes a statutory duty on the deputy
                    to act in the best interests of the mentally incapacitated person (see s 3(5) of
                    the Mental Capacity Act). In conjunction, r 179 of the Family Justice Rules 2014
                    (S 813/2014) requires an application to become a deputy of a mentally
                    incapacitated person to be served on all named defendants and “relevant
                    persons”, the latter of which includes the immediate family members of
                    the person and even relatives or friends who have a close relationship with the
                    person. This will allow the “relevant persons” to intervene in the
                    application if they so wish. The court, having all the relevant and necessary
                    information before it, would then be able to appoint the most suitable person(s)
                    to be the deputy to act on behalf of the mentally incapacitated person. Hence, a
                    deputy appointed under the Mental Capacity Act would be in the best position to
                    decide whether to make a claim under the Act on behalf of the mentally
                    incapacitated employee. That deputy will be granted various express powers that
                    the court deems necessary and this includes the power to make a claim under the
                    Act or to pursue a common law action on behalf of the injured employee as will
                    be in his best interests. The potential for abuse of position is thus kept, as
                    far as is possible, within acceptable limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Accordingly, in my judgment, the next-of-kin
                    of a mentally incapacitated employee do not have, without more, the requisite
                    capacity to make a claim under the Act on behalf of the employee. Only a person
                    duly appointed by the court under the Mental Capacity Act will have the legal
                    capacity to do so. I am therefore unable to agree with Mr Anparasan’s
                    submission that such other person may be any next-of-kin of the Injured Employee
                    that the Commissioner has deemed satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Importantly, this is the current position
                    adopted by the Commissioner as well. In the “Authority to Claim”
                    form that is normally issued by the Commissioner to any person intending to
                    claim on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee, it specifically provides
                    that a claim can only be made by a Committee of the Person and Estate (currently
                    known as the deputy) appointed by the court. Oddly though, the Commissioner in
                    the present case appears to have overlooked this requirement and proceeded to
                    issue the Notice of Assessment before receiving the “Authority to
                    Claim” form from Rodney Tan or Mdm Lim Davy. Finally, although a duly
                    appointed deputy would typically be the only appropriate person to make a claim
                    under the Act on behalf of the mentally incapacitated employee, I must not be
                    taken to have decided that no one else can ever do so. There may be very
                    exceptional circumstances, for example emergency situations, but this is
                    certainly not the case here and I say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I recognise that there is a one year
                    limitation under the Act to make a claim beginning from the date of the
                    accident, or in the case of death, within one year from the date of death. The
                    process of appointing a deputy may, in some circumstances, be a lengthy one. For
                    example, it took more than a year after the Injured Employee’s accident
                    before Rodney Tan became appointed as deputy. The cause of the delay is not in
                    the evidence before me. However, s 11(4) of the Act clearly provides that
                    the making of a claim after the lapse of this one year limitation shall not be a
                    bar to making a claim under the Act if it is found that there was, <em>inter alia</em>, a reasonable cause for the delay. A delay
                    due to the next-of-kin having to apply to become a deputy because the employee
                    himself has become mentally incapacitated can constitute reasonable cause. That
                    having been said, the application for a deputy by the next-of-kin should be made
                    within a reasonable time of the determination of the employee’s mental
                    incapacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It follows that for the reasons set out above,
                    neither Rodney Tan nor Mdm Lim Davy had the legal capacity to decide on behalf
                    of the Injured Employee to make a claim under the Act as neither had been
                    appointed a deputy of the Injured Employee under the Mental Capacity Act at the
                    relevant time, <em>ie</em>, 20 May 2010. Their instructions
                    to Marican to write to the Commissioner to make a claim under the Act were
                    similarly made without legal capacity and competence and accordingly of no
                    effect. I accept the submission of Mr Jesudevan that the Notice of Assessment
                    issued by the Commissioner was issued in error and therefore a nullity and of no
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Injured Employee left no indication as to
                    who he desired to make decisions on his behalf in the event he was
                    incapacitated. The law must follow its course. The power of attorney granted by
                    Mdm Lim Davy to Rodney Tan is similarly of no effect as she was not the duly
                    appointed deputy of the Injured Employee and did not have the legal capacity or
                    competence to make a claim under the Act. Accordingly, the 20 May 2010 Letter
                    does not constitute a valid claim under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Does the fact that Rodney Tan was subsequently
                    appointed to be the deputy of the Injured Employee, and was granted express
                    powers by the court to make a claim under the Act on behalf of the Injured
                    Employee, make any difference? In my judgment it does not. At the relevant point
                    in time when the 20 May 2010 Letter was sent, it is clear that Rodney Tan had
                    not yet been appointed the Deputy of the Injured Employee. The subsequent
                    appointment of Rodney Tan as the deputy of the Injured Employee does not change
                    the fact that the 20 May 2010 election was made without legal
                capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Since the 20 May 2010 Letter does not amount
                    to a valid claim, the Notice of Assessment issued by the Commissioner is issued
                    in excess of jurisdiction and in error. It is axiomatic that an <em>ultra vires</em> decision is a nullity (see <em>Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission and
                        another</em> [1969] 2 AC 147). The Notice of Assessment is hence a
                    nullity and the Commissioner’s decision on 1 July 2014 was correctly
                    made. I accordingly dismiss OS 918.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OS 265</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having held that the Notice of Assessment is a
                    nullity and the Commissioner has accepted it as so, there is no longer any need
                    for OS 265. However, to put the matter beyond doubt, I grant the Quashing Order
                    prayed for in OS 265.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Before I conclude, I note that the Employer
                    and its insurer have suffered some degree of prejudice in the present case. The
                    Employer was always under the impression, and not wrongfully so, that they had
                    satisfied their liability under the Act. In this regard, they had closed their
                    books. Furthermore, their ability to defend a common law action for damages may
                    be affected as it would be difficult to reinvestigate the matter given that
                    almost six years have passed since the day of the accident. Nonetheless, the
                    Commissioner had mistakenly acted beyond her jurisdiction and her Notice of
                    Assessment is a nullity and there is no bar for the Injured Employee to proceed
                    with his claim at common law. Nothing in my judgment impinges upon or is in any
                    way expressing a view on liability and/or contributory negligence in Suit 851.
                    That remains within the domain of the judge trying the case.</p>
