        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a tragic case of a young couple who had
                    a bittersweet relationship that culminated in a homicide. The appellant, Pathip
                    Selvan s/o Sugumaran (“the accused”), caused the death of Jeevitha
                    d/o Panippan (“the deceased”) on 7 July 2008 by stabbing her
                    repeatedly all over her body. The multiple injuries caused were sufficient in
                    the ordinary course of nature to cause death. He now appeals against the
                    decision of the trial judge (“the Judge”), who found him guilty of
                    murder. The Judge rejected all the accused’s defences, found that he had
                    committed an offence under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and imposed the mandatory death
                    penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused was 22 years old at the time of the
                    offence. He has three siblings; an older brother, a younger brother and a
                    younger sister. His parents were divorced when he was only five years old. After
                    the divorce, the accused and his two brothers lived at the Sri Ramakrishna
                    Mission Boys’ Home from 1992 to 1996. Thereafter, he lived with his
                    maternal grandmother when he was young. He has lived at different points of time
                    with his mother, stepfather and maternal grandparents during the past few
                        years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> After completing his “N” Levels he
                    studied electrical engineering at the Institute of Technical Education, but
                    dropped out from his course in his second year. He was then enlisted as a
                    fireman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force and concluded his National Service
                    (“NS”) in January 2007. Prior to his arrest, he was working for
                    his uncle as a movement operator at WeiShen Trading &amp; Services Co Ltd.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The deceased was 18 years old at the time of her
                    death. She used to work as a kindergarten teacher. At the time of her demise,
                    she was studying for her GCE “O” Levels as a private
                        candidate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between the accused and the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The accused gave the following account of his
                    relationship with the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    They met in November or December 2007 through Suresh, a mutual friend. According
                    to the accused, she had up to 16 boyfriends at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They became friends but their
                    relationship eventually grew closer. On 10 April 2008, the deceased met the
                    accused’s family members, and later the accused brought her to his
                    sister’s bedroom where they became intimate. This led the deceased to say
                    in Tamil, “Now you have done everything to me, so you are my boyfriend. I
                    hope you will not leave me.” The accused replied “[y]a, obviously
                    you are my girl”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The accused’s
                    family, however, disapproved of their relationship. According to the
                    accused’s mother, the deceased would often ask for money from the accused
                    and the accused’s relationship with his family became strained because of
                        this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Their relationship hit a difficult patch in May
                    2008, when the deceased began to meet a male friend, one Kesh, frequently. The
                    accused became suspicious about her relationship with Kesh and obtained
                    Kesh’s telephone number to call him and ascertain the nature of the
                    relationship. Kesh, who said that the deceased had never told him about the
                    accused, claimed that the deceased was interested in him although he already had
                    a girlfriend. He stated that he kissed the deceased and fondled her at a void
                    deck. Immediately after calling Kesh, the accused called the deceased and told
                    her that he hoped that she did not hide anything from him. She replied that she
                    had never hidden anything from him. The accused then told her that he had spoken
                    with Kesh and asked her to meet him at the study corner at Blk 155 Ang Mo
                    Kio, which was near her house.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       When they met, the deceased immediately hugged
                    him and started tearing. She admitted that she had lied about her relationship
                    with Kesh and that they had kissed and fondled each other. She then promised him
                    that she would refrain from having any further contact with Kesh. The accused
                    then hugged and kissed her. He forgave her and told her that she was not to
                    repeat the same conduct.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After they made up, the accused and the deceased
                    met regularly and were often intimate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In May 2008, the accused wanted to take up a
                    part-time course in Petroleum and Chemical Process Technology at ITE College
                    East, but he deferred his application because the deceased wanted to retake her
                    GCE “O” Level examination but lacked the financial means to do so.
                    He obtained money purportedly for his own school fees from his grandmother and
                    gave the money to the deceased for her examination fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 25 May 2008, the accused and the
                    deceased quarrelled over an incident, the details of which the former was unable
                    to recollect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> On 27 May 2008, the two
                    quarrelled again as the deceased said that the accused only wanted her body and
                    not her heart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> On 28 May 2008, the
                    deceased called the accused to inform him that she wanted to visit her sworn
                    brother at Choa Chu Kang and that she did not have any money. The accused then
                    decided to meet her. However, he knew that if he had said that he wanted to meet
                    her, the deceased would not have agreed to this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Hence, he lied to her saying that he would
                    transfer some money into his friend’s account and that she could collect
                    the money from his friend at Admiralty MRT station. He then went to Admiralty
                    MRT station so that he could meet her. At the station, he saw her with her sworn
                    bother, went up to her, grabbed her hand and told her sworn brother to leave.
                    While the deceased was being pulled along, she made a call on her handphone
                    claiming, “[h]ello, hello Police, my boyfriend just kidnapped me”.
                    The accused grabbed her handphone and cut off the line. He pulled her into a
                    taxi and went to his uncle’s house.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After they alighted from the taxi and were
                    walking towards the accused’s uncle’s house, the accused noticed
                    that the deceased’s handphone was ringing and that the caller was her
                    ex-boyfriend, Uthiswaran s/o Hendry A (“Uthish”), who lived
                    at Choa Chu Kang. He answered the call, put the phone to her ear and asked her
                    to speak to Uthish. However, the deceased refused. The accused then asked her
                    whether she was going to Choa Chu Kang to meet Uthish. The deceased cried and
                    asked the accused to trust her. She said that if he did not trust her, he could
                    call Uthish himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The accused then called
                    Uthish and said in Tamil, “[w]hy the fuck you call my girlfriend
                    for”. Uthish replied that he had called the deceased to find out her
                    mother’s handphone number. The accused told Uthish not to call the
                    deceased anymore. He added that Uthish should call him first if the latter
                    wanted anything from the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently, the accused and the deceased
                    reconciled at the accused’s uncle’s house and became intimate. While
                    they were having sex, the accused ejaculated into her vagina despite the
                    latter’s protests. The deceased cried and asked the accused whether he
                    would really be responsible for the baby if she became pregnant. The accused
                    said that he would. The deceased also asked the accused if he would eventually
                    abandon her. The accused replied that if he had intended to abandon her, he
                    would not have ejaculated thus and he had done so to show that he really loved
                        her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Later that day, the deceased made a police
                    report that the accused had raped her. When the accused returned home that
                    night, he saw police officers inside his house and decided not to enter his
                    house in case they were looking for him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He called his friend, Kartigesan s/o Yanamani
                    (“Kathik”), and asked him where the deceased was. Kathik informed
                    him that the deceased had attempted to commit suicide. The accused decided not
                    to return home until he found out what was going on. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Around two or three days later, the accused
                    called his mother, who informed him that the deceased had reported to the police
                    that he had raped her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The accused called Kathik a number
                    of times to find out how the deceased was doing. On one occasion, Kathik passed
                    his handphone to the deceased so that the accused could speak with her. When the
                    accused asked the deceased why she had lodged a police report against him, she
                    cried and said that she was confused and did not know why she had done so. The
                    deceased then promised to withdraw the complaint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently, the accused met the
                    deceased’s father, Panippan s/o Sinnappan
                    (“Mr Panippan”), and told the latter that he wanted to marry
                    her. Mr Pannipan asked him why he had suddenly decided to marry his
                    daughter. The accused replied that the deceased was pregnant and had lodged a
                    police report against him for raping her. Mr Pannipan responded saying that
                    he would call the deceased and talk to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The next day, the accused had a phone
                    conversation with the deceased, who was unhappy that he had seen her father
                    without her. She told him to surrender himself to the Police.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> On the following day, the accused
                    surrendered himself to the Police and was released on station bail. He was
                    warned not to see or talk to the deceased until the case was concluded.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Around four days after the accused was
                    released on bail, the deceased called him to find out how he was doing and told
                    him that she needed to go for an appointment on 30 June 2008 for a
                    pregnancy test. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> They reconciled and started dating
                    again. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> On 29 June 2008, the accused went
                    clubbing with some friends. However, as he felt guilty about clubbing without

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chain of events leading to the killing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 6 July 2008, the accused spoke to the
                    deceased over the telephone and learnt from her that she had influenza and was
                        coughing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The next day, he
                    pretended to be sick so as to be able to take leave and take her to see a
                    doctor. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> He went to the deceased’s flat on
                    the second floor of Block 157, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. Instead of
                    entering her house, he decided to check if the deceased was still asleep. He
                    took a chair, climbed onto it and looked into the deceased’s bedroom from
                    the common corridor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> To his horror, the accused saw the
                    deceased lying on her bed and kissing a man wearing a red tee shirt and long
                        pants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He was shocked and very angry. He
                    went to the main door, kicked it very hard, and shouted three times in Tamil,
                    “[f]aster open the door”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The deceased came to the door but refused to let
                    him into her flat. He asked her if she was hiding anything from him, but she
                    denied this, and said “why do you always have to suspect me?” She
                    also told him that she would call him after her medical appointment at Kandang
                    Kerbau Hospital at 3.40pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The accused waited at the staircase of the
                    deceased’s block of flats, hoping to meet her before she went for her
                    medical appointment. However, he fell asleep while waiting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, he learnt from the
                    deceased’s friend, Hemavathy d/o V Moganaval (“Hema”)
                    that the deceased and her mother would be returning to the flat in over an
                    hour’s time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While waiting for the deceased to return, the
                    accused called his friend, Balasubramaniam s/o Tangavelu (“Bala”)
                    to accompany him. He also decided to buy a knife to force the deceased to tell
                    him the truth about the man in the red tee shirt. In his statement to the police
                    dated 11 July 2008, he recounted:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    I then decided to buy a knife. I wanted to use the
                            knife to threaten Jeev. I knew that she would not tell me the truth if I
                            did not threaten her with a knife. She is a better talker than me and
                            she always has the final say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    … When I wanted to pay for the knife, the
                            auntie asked me why I wanted to buy the knife and I told her that my
                            mother asked me to buy the knife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    I took out the knife from the new casing and threw
                            the casing into a drain together with the plastic bag. I then tucked the
                            knife at the back of my waist and covered it with my t-shirt. When I
                            arrived at the void deck of Blk 181 Ang Mo Kio, I saw a lot of
                            purple coloured flyers on the floor near to the letter boxes. I picked
                            up two or three flyers. I then went up the staircase and took out the
                            knife that I just bought. I rolled the flyers over the knife and folded
                            one end of the flyers over the sharp end of the knife. I then tucked the
                            knife with the flyer at my back and covered it with my shirt. I did this
                            because while I was walking with the knife tucked at my back, I could
                            feel the sharp part of the knife against my back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After buying the knife, the accused bought a
                    “Winnie the Pooh” correction pen for the deceased as he knew that
                    she liked such items.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The accused then met up with Bala,
                    Bala’s girlfriend and Viknesh s/o Rajandren (“Vicky”) at a
                    nearby coffeeshop and waited for the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> At around 8.00pm, he received a call
                    from the deceased, who asked him to meet her at the void deck of Blk 155
                    Ang Mo Kio. He told his friends that he was going to meet the deceased and that
                    he would return with her later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The accused proceeded to Block 155 and
                    met the deceased and her mother. According to the deceased’s mother, the
                    accused asked her for permission to marry the deceased. He promised to give the
                    deceased a good life and said that he wanted to see the deceased’s face
                    every day. He disclosed that he used to be a gang member but had changed after
                    meeting the deceased. He told her that he had started attending church every
                    Saturday because of the deceased. After talking to the accused for a while, the
                    deceased’s mother left him and the deceased alone. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The events that followed are now set out in
                    the accused’s own words:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    I then asked Jeev to go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden.
                            As I had mentioned before, we used to go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden which
                            is nearby. However, this time, I intend to ask her about the man who was
                            with her this morning. To go to Ang Mo Kio West Garden, we have to walk
                            to Blk 154 Ang Mo Kio, before taking the staircase to the Ang Mo
                            Kio West Garden. While we were at the void deck of Blk 154 Ang Mo
                            Kio, I saw the bushes around the power station infront of Blk 154
                            Ang Mo Kio. I knew that at that time there will be a lot of people at
                            Ang Mo Kio West Garden and when I saw the bushes behind the power
                            station, I thought that it is a better place to ask Jeev about the main.
                            I knew that if I were to threaten Jeev with the knife that I bought,
                            people at the Ang Mo Kio West Garden could see me but behind the bushes,
                            no one could see clearly because the bushes are quite high and
                            thick.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Immediately I told her that I wanted to talk to
                            her. She asked me (<em>sic</em>) that we are going
                            up to the garden. I just replied no and I wanted to talk to her and
                            pulled her to the back of the power station behind the
                        bushes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    While we were behind the power station, she was
                            standing near to the wall of the power station and I was standing facing
                            her with the bushes behind me. I asked her in English saying “You
                            are not hiding anything from me right?”. She replied
                            “No”. I asked her again in English “You are not
                            lying to me anything?”. She replied “No”. I just
                            shouted at her in Tamil “Who the fuck was the man in the red
                            shirt in bed with you this morning?”. She was stunned. On seeing
                            her reaction, she knew then that I know what she had done. I cried and
                            asked her in Tamil “Why, why, what did I not do for you, I really
                            can’t understand, tell me?”. She replied in Tamil
                                “<em>he is better than you in bed that is why
                                I am after him”.</em> At this juncture, I took out the
                            knife from behind me with my right hand and stabbed her on her stomach.
                            The moment I stabbed her, she was holding my hands with both her hands.
                            When I pulled the knife out from her body, I felt she scratched my right
                            hand. I continued to use the knife to stab Jeev several times. I could
                            not remember where I had stabbed her or which part of her body that I
                            stabbed her. All this while, Jeev was holding on to the lower part of my
                            left hand just above my wrist with her right hand and kept on shouting
                            in English “I love you, I love you.” I stopped stabbing
                            her when she released her grip on my right hand. When she let go of my
                            left hand, I realised that Jeev was already lying on the ground. Her
                            legs were nearer to Blk 154 and I was bending down looking at
                            her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    I saw that she was bleeding from the left side of
                            her neck. I squat down and kissed her right cheek and I removed the gold
                            chain which I had bought for her as a gift. As far as both of us are
                            concerned, it is a sacred matrimonial chain which I had bought for her
                            as a symbol that she is my wife. I just threw at the side. I could not
                            remember where exactly I threw it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    I got scared and walked out of the area very
                            quickly. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The accused testified that when he heard the
                    deceased’s remark ridiculing him he had “<em>never
                        been this sad</em>” and became “<em>very,
                        very angry</em>”. [emphasis added]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> After stabbing the
                    deceased, the accused walked away from the scene. As he left the scene, he
                    picked up some brochures on the floor of the void deck of Blk 154 Ang Mo
                    Kio to wrap the knife. He then boarded a taxi and headed for Woodlands. Along
                    the way, he got out of the taxi and threw the knife into a drain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The accused telephoned his mother and told her
                    that he wanted to do some shopping in Malaysia. He asked her to bring him a pair
                    of jeans and a tee shirt. After meeting his mother, the accused put on the
                    clothes that his mother had brought and both of them went by taxi to the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint, where he applied for and obtained a Document of Identity,
                    which enabled him to enter Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> While they were both in Johor Bahru, he left his
                    mother alone at a restaurant, and took a taxi to Danga Bay and spent the night
                    there. His mother eventually returned to Singapore alone. The next afternoon, he
                    made a telephone call to his home and told his mother and other members of his
                    family to take care of themselves and that they would not be hearing from him
                    again because he was going to die.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> His mother told him to return home because the
                    police, who were at the house, would take her to the police station if he did
                    not return.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> On hearing that, he asked her to pass
                    the phone to the police officer, and told the latter not to do anything to his
                    family as he would immediately surrender himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The accused then went to the Woodlands
                    Checkpoint and surrendered himself to Inspector Mohamad Raffi bin Mohamad of the
                    Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. He said to the latter, “Sir,
                    yesterday I wanted to run away. <em>I killed my girlfriend

                    his arrest, the accused stated in response to a charge of murdering the
                    deceased:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That day morning, I went to her house in Ang Mo Kio. I did not go to work.
                        I took a chair from a neighbour and placed it infront [<em>sic</em>] of her corridor window. I got up the chair and looked
                        inside. I saw her kissing someone on the bed. I got down the chair and
                        kicked her house door. I asked her whether I could come in. She told me not
                        to. I then told her that it was not the first time I went to her place. She
                        told me “Not today. I am not in the mood”. On the same night,
                        I confronted her about the guy in her house. But she did not want to talk
                        about it. I asked her about the guy in the red shirt. She was stunned when I
                        asked her about this. I asked her what she found in him did not find in
                            me<em>. She said that he is better in bed than
                            me.</em> That’s why I took out a knife and stabbed her in
                        her stomach. After that, I closed my eyes and blindly stabbed her a lot of
                        times until she released her hands from mine. Before leaving the place, I
                        kissed her on the right cheek and then pulled the chain on her neck which I
                        had bought her. That’s all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The post-mortem</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Dr George Paul
                    (“Dr Paul”), a Consultant Forensic Pathologist, undertook a

                    wounds were directed wounds, in that they were inflicted with the <em>intent to wound</em>, and were <em>not

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The accused admitted to killing the deceased
                    and was charged under s 300(c) of the Penal Code. He relied on the partial
                    defences of provocation in Exception 1 and diminished responsibility in
                    Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With regard to provocation, the accused
                    claimed that he was in a greatly agitated and vulnerable state of mind and the
                    deceased’s callous utterance that the other man was better than he in bed
                    caused him to lose his self-control. The accused’s counsel, Mr Subhas
                    Anandan, contends that the provocation was grave and sudden such that a
                    reasonable man sharing his characteristics would have reacted the same way. In
                    relation to diminished responsibility, the accused relied on the evidence of
                    Dr Tommy Tan (“Dr Tan”), a senior psychiatrist in
                    private practice. Dr Tan said that the accused suffered from Attention
                    Deficit Disorder/Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) which was as an
                    abnormality of mind induced by a disease of the mind. Dr Tan opined that this
                    made the accused prone to rage outbursts, and that substantially impaired his
                    mental responsibility for causing the deceased’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Prosecution submitted that both the
                    provocation and diminished responsibility defences were inapplicable. It
                    submitted that the accused was deliberate in his attack and had not lost his
                    self control. Furthermore, it contended that the alleged provocation was neither
                    grave nor sudden. The Prosecution asserted that Dr Tan’s opinion was
                    not credible and relied instead on the psychiatric report of its psychiatrist,
                    Dr Joshua Kua (“Dr Kua”), a consultant psychiatrist at
                    the Institute of Mental Health, who found that the accused did not suffer from
                    any abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility.
                    As such, the Prosecution submitted that the accused should be convicted of
                    murder, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”), who found the accused guilty of the s 300(c) charge, made
                    the following findings of fact in his grounds of decision, <em>Public Prosecutor v Pathip Selvan s/o Sugumaran</em> [2010]
                    SGHC 335 (“the GD”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     the evidence showed that the accused
                        never had any significant functional impairment. He made unremarkable
                        progress through school and NS, and at the time of the offence he had a
                        normal working life. Hence, the defence of diminished responsibility was not
                        made out: at [32];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     the deceased’s words had an impact on the accused. A reasonable
                        person in the accused’s position would be hurt by her words, but would
                        not be so enraged that he would lose his power of self control: at [36];
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     the accused
                        did not lose his self control as a result of the provocation. While he told
                        Dr Tan that his mind went blank, this was more than a year after the
                        event. He had not said this in his previous statements to the police or in
                        his interview with Dr Kua. In addition, his mental processes did not
                        cease during the attack. While he closed his eyes, he felt the deceased
                        holding onto his hands, he knew that he continued to wield the knife and
                        that she scratched his right hand when he pulled the knife out of her body.
                        He had heard her protestations of love for him. He remembered that he knelt
                        to kiss the deceased, and that he decided to remove her necklace or
                        “thali” which was a symbol of their relationship: at [38] and
                        [39].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues in the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The issues in this appeal are whether the
                    accused can rely on the partial defences of provocation or diminished
                    responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence of provocation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Penal Code, as a concession to human
                    frailty and weakness, recognises some partial defences to the offence of
                    homicide. The partial defence of provocation, which reduces the offence
                    committed from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, is found in
                    Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code
                    (“Exception 1”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Exception 1.</em>—Culpable homicide is
                        not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by
                        grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the
                        provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or
                        accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is instructive when considering the partial
                    defence of grave and sudden provocation to bear in mind the views of
                    Lord Macaulay, the draftsman of the Indian Penal Code, on the need to
                    mitigate the consequences of homicide committed in the sudden heat of passion on
                    great provocation; see <em>Notes on the Indian Penal Code, The
                        Works of Lord Macaulay; Speeches Poems </em><em>&amp;
                        Miscellaneous Writings, Vol 1</em> (Longmans Green and Co, 1898)
                    at p 120:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agree with the great mass of mankind, and with the majority of jurists,
                        ancient and modern, in thinking that homicide committed in the sudden heat
                        of passion, on great provocation, ought to be punished ; but that in
                        general it ought not to be punished so severely as murder. It ought to be
                        punished in order to reach men to entertain a peculiar respect for human
                        life ; it ought to be punished in order to give men a motive for
                        accustoming themselves to govern their passions; and in some few cases for
                        which we have made provision, we conceive that it ought to be punished with
                        the utmost rigour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In general, however, we would not visit homicide
                            committed in violent passion, which had been suddenly provoked, with the
                            highest penalties of the law.</em> We think that to treat a person
                        guilty of such homicide as we should treat a murderer would be a highly
                        inexpedient course,—a course which would shock the universal feeling
                        of mankind, and would engage the public sympathy on the side of the
                        delinquent against the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This partial defence recognises that individuals can in limited
                    situations be emotionally overwhelmed and offend under conditions of extreme
                    fear, sadness, depression or even jealousy. This is a difficult area of the law
                    that requires the courts to balance contemporary standards and the societal
                    mores of the day with the need to deter violent conduct emanating from rage. It
                    is now trite that there are two distinct requirements for the defence of
                    provocation to apply (see <em>Mohammed Ali bin Johari v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (“<em>Johari</em>”) at [101], citing S<em>eah
                        Kok Meng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [21]).
                    First, it must be shown that the accused was deprived of self-control by the
                    provocation (“the subjective test”). Secondly, the provocation
                    must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person
                    of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would
                    affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose
                    self control (“the objective test”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The subjective test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     To be able to rely on provocation as a partial
                    defence, the accused must first show that he was in fact deprived of
                    self-control by the provocation. The classic direction on what constitutes loss
                    of self-control was given in <em>R v Duffy</em> [1949]
                    1 All ER 932 (“<em>Duffy</em>”) where
                    the Court of Criminal Appeal approved of the following formulation by
                    Devlin J in the court below as “impeccable” (at 932):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so
                        subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his
                            [<em>sic</em>] mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Where a killing is premeditated, the question
                    of loss of self-control is, without more, quite irrelevant. <em>In the present case, there was absolutely no evidence that the killing was
                        premeditated.</em> In this regard, it is noteworthy that at the
                    hearing of the appeal, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Khoo
                    (“Mr Khoo”) stated that the Prosecution’s case was not
                    that the killing was premeditated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> but that the accused had brought the
                    knife to the meeting in order to threaten the deceased and use the knife to hurt
                    her if she did not give him a satisfactory answer. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> This is a significant concession. The
                    accused, who had consistently maintained that he brought the knife to threaten
                    and not to harm the deceased, had previously threatened her with a knife. He
                    explained that in May 2008, when the deceased was staying over at the house of
                    her friend, Kathik, he had threatened her with a knife so that she would not
                    return home late. He testified:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If I do not confront her with a knife, she will
                            talk and ... outsmart me. And if I confront her with the knife, she will
                            tell the truth.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And would I be ... correct in saying that …
                            your talking to her with a knife worked?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, because she’s very afraid of the
                            knife.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The accused’s evidence that the knife
                    was only intended for threatening the deceased is credibly supported by the
                    facts. To begin with, the accused had arranged to meet the deceased in a public
                    place, which militates against the argument that he had planned to hurt the
                    deceased with the knife. In addition, two of the accused’s friends, Vicky
                    and Bala, testified confirming that the accused was supposed to return <em>with the deceased</em> to meet them after he had spoken to
                        her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Crucially, prior
                    to his meeting with the deceased, the accused had spoken to the deceased’s
                    mother regarding his plan to marry her. According to the deceased’s
                    mother, the accused spoke very softly and politely and promised to take good
                    care of her daughter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span><em>In our view, there was no reason to doubt that the accused
                        passionately loved the deceased, and had arranged for the meeting to
                        reconcile with rather than to harm, let alone kill,
                her.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having determined that the killing of the
                    deceased was not premeditated, the next question which arises is whether the
                    accused had experienced “sudden and temporary loss of self
                    control” as a result of the provocation, which made him no longer a
                    “master of [his] mind” (see [35] above). A close analysis of the
                    accused’s mental state during the killing is necessary to determine both
                    why and whether he had lost self-control. In this context, it is plain that the
                    Judge had erroneously found that the accused’s claim about his
                    “mind going blank” was only made to Dr Tan more than a year
                    after the killing (GD at [39]). In fact, from the outset, in his statement to
                    the police given soon after he surrendered dated 14 July 2008, the accused
                    had stated that his mind went blank at the material time:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the first stab, I closed my eyes and I started to swing and stab her
                        several times. I do not know how many times I did this. I could not remember
                        clearly what I had done. <em>My mind went blank at that
                            moment</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the same statement, the accused said that
                    when the deceased’s friend, Hema, asked him why he had killed the
                    deceased, he replied “I do not know myself. My mind went
                        blank.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Thus, it appears that the
                    accused’s claim that his mind went blank was not, as the Prosecution
                    initially submitted, and the Judge found, an afterthought. Although the accused
                    explained that “what was going through my mind at that time were images
                    of [the deceased] in bed with another man and the other things she had done to
                    me previously”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> this does not preclude him from
                    relying on the partial defence of provocation. There is no need for his mind to
                    be completely blank or for there to be automatism when the deceased was stabbed
                    to establish this partial defence. In this regard, the Judge correctly
                    determined that the accused’s mental processes did not cease during the
                    killing (GD at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When all his statements are examined, it is clear that his mental
                        processes did not cease during the attack. While he had closed his eyes, he
                        felt that the deceased was holding onto his hands, <em>he
                            knew that he continued to wield the knife and that she scratched his
                            right hand when he pulled the knife out of [her] body. He heard her
                            protestations of love for him.</em> He remembered that he knelt to
                        kiss the deceased, and that he decided to remove her necklace or
                        “thali”, which was a symbol of their relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, while the accused appeared at some level of consciousness to
                    be aware of what was happening during the killing, this did not, without more,
                    mean that he did not lose self-control. The human mind has several levels and
                    streams of consciousness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The crucial question is whether the accused
                    had suddenly lost self-control at the material time, <em>ie</em>, when he wildly stabbed her (see [26] and [42]) due to the
                    perceived provocation to the extent that he was <em>no longer in
                        control of his mind</em>. In our view, the facts strongly suggested
                    that this was the case. The accused had been deeply in love and obsessed with
                    the deceased. Despite a tumultuous relationship that included severe bouts of
                    distrust and recurring episodes of intense jealousy, they invariably reconciled.
                    We accept that the accused had intensely passionate feelings for her. As
                    mentioned earlier, he had again expected to reconcile with her after talking to
                    her despite the distress he felt about the latest perceived indiscretion. He had
                    expected her to beg for his forgiveness as she had done on a previous occasion
                    when he confronted her about her infidelity (see [6]). However, unfortunately,
                    events did not unfold the way the accused had hoped. The deceased was not only
                    unrepentant, but also uttered the taunting remark that the man in the red tee
                    shirt was a better lover than he. Against the backdrop of the prevailing unhappy
                    circumstances, it is plausible that this remark then immediately precipitated
                    the loss of his self-control. It should not be overlooked that the accused was
                    already crying when the taunt was uttered. This heightened emotional state
                    probably made him even more emotional and vulnerable to loss of
                        self-control.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The fact that multiple injuries were inflicted
                    in an <em>entirely random and frenzied</em> manner all over
                    the deceased’s body also suggests that the accused had suddenly lost
                    self-control. As mentioned earlier (see [26] above), there were 15 external
                    injuries over various parts of her body. In his statement to the police dated
                    14 July 2008, the accused stated thus: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the first stab, I closed my eyes and I started to swing and stab her
                        several times. I do not know how many times I did this. I could not remember
                        clearly what I had done. My mind went blank at that moment. At times, I
                        could feel that the knife I was holding hit onto something but at times, I
                        felt that I was swinging my hand in the air. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Much had been made of the accused’s
                    meticulous post-killing conduct. The Judge stated that the accused should have
                    been very alarmed and concerned when he saw the deceased lying on the ground
                    bleeding if his mind really “went blank” (GD at [22]). However,
                    the approach adopted in <em>Public Prosecutor v Sundarti
                        Supriyanto</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [154], quite correctly
                    indicates that whether post-killing conduct can be taken into account depends on
                    the facts of each case. The conduct of different individuals after they recover
                    their composure (partially or completely) after momentarily losing it can vary
                    infinitely and is contingent upon the existence of incalculable imponderables.
                    It would not be correct to place undue weight on conduct after the offending act
                    in a case such as this. Admittedly, the accused’s actions indicate that he
                    had regained at least part of his composure. After the deceased had fallen
                    unconscious to the ground, he bent down to kiss her once on her cheek and pulled
                    a gold chain, which he had given to the deceased as a symbol of marriage, off
                    her neck as he felt she did not deserve it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> However, this does
                    not decisively indicate that he had not been deprived of self-control when he
                    had earlier suddenly in a frenzied manner randomly stabbed the deceased all over
                    her body. Rather, the history of their turbulent relationship indicated that he
                    appeared prone to lose self-control very easily and regain it just as quickly.
                    In response to a query from us, the Prosecution stated that it was not in a
                    position to dispute this view of the accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    It would be recalled that earlier that fateful day, upon seeing the deceased
                    behaving intimately with the man in the red tee shirt, the accused went to the
                    front door of the deceased’s house and impulsively kicked it very hard.
                    Nonetheless, he was able to quickly regain his composure and asked the deceased
                    to let him enter the house.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> In our view, the circumstances pointed to the
                    conclusion that the accused had likely lost self-control as a result of the
                    provocation and that he committed a crime of passion in the heat of the
                    moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The objective test </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     To satisfy the objective test, the accused
                    must establish on a balance of probabilities (<em>Vijayan v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1974-1976] SLR(R) 373 at [31]) that an
                    ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his
                    characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been
                    so provoked as to suddenly lose his self control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     There has been some controversy regarding the
                    nature and application of the objective test. While the provocation must of
                    course be grave and sudden, there is no settled definition of the terms
                    “grave and sudden” in the Penal Code. In <em>Public
                        Prosecution v Kwan Cin Cheng</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 434
                        (“<em>Kwan Cin Cheng</em>”), this court
                    held (at [72]) that what constitutes grave and sudden provocation will depend on
                    the facts of each case. Bearing in mind that the Penal Code is derived from the
                    Indian Penal Code, Indian authorities continue to be useful to Singapore court
                    in assessing whether a particular provocation is grave and sudden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for what is “sudden”, a
                    leading treatise, <em>Dr Sri Hari Singh Gour’s Penal
                        Law of India</em>, vol 3 (Law Publishers (India<em>)</em> Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed Revised, 2011) (“<em>Gour</em>”), declares as follows (at
                    p 2498):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When it is said that the provocation must be “sudden” it is
                        implied that it should have all immediately preceded the homicide in point
                        of time. <em>A person may by repeated or continuous
                            provocation arouse another to a state of mind when the provocation
                            immediately preceding the act is only the last straw.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     What amounts to “sudden”
                    provocation was elaborated on in <em>K M Nanavati
                        </em><em>v State of Maharashtra</em> AIR 1962 SC
                    605 (“<em>Nanavati</em>”) by the Indian
                    Supreme Court, which stated (at 630):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fatal blow should be clearly traced to the influence of passion
                        arising from that provocation and not after passion had cooled down by lapse
                        of time, or otherwise giving room and scope for premeditation and
                        calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Mahmood v State</em> AIR 1961 ALL 538,
                    Oak J had perceptively noted (at 538–539):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether the provocation was sudden or not does not present much
                        difficulty. The word ‘sudden’ involves two elements. <em>Firstly, the provocation must be unexpected.</em> If an
                        accused plans in advance to receive a provocation in order to justify the
                        subsequent homicide, the provocation cannot be said to be sudden. <em>Secondly, the interval between the provocation and the homicide
                            should be brief.</em> If the man giving the provocation is killed
                        within a minute after the provocation, it is a case of sudden provocation.
                        If the man is killed six hours after the provocation, it is not a case of
                        sudden provocation. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We note that the Judge had not made any
                    specific finding on the absence of a sudden provocation. However, in our view,
                    the present case, the requirement of a “sudden” provocation had
                    been met. As mentioned earlier, the accused had fully expected to reconcile with
                    the deceased and cement their relationship through marriage. The fact that he
                    earnestly disclosed to the deceased’s mother shortly before the incident
                    his intention to marry her, as well as informed his friends that he was
                    proceeding to meet the deceased and would later join them with her, are
                    significant considerations that militate against premeditation. We pause to note
                    that Mr Khoo acknowledged in the course of argument that the accused had
                    created “a very good impression on the [deceased’s] mother”
                    and that the deceased’s mother testified that she felt the accused was a
                    “fine gentleman and … she trusted him”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span><em>Further, the Prosecution did not question his evidence that
                        he had believed that she would ask for forgiveness like she did on a
                        previous occasion when she was confronted with her infidelity with
                        Kesh</em>. Indeed, Kathik, a witness for the Prosecution, also
                    confirmed that the accused had previously threatened the deceased similarly
                    without any untoward consequences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>
                    There was at most only a brief time interval between the provocation and killing
                    as the accused stabbed the deceased immediately after her scornful taunt.
                    Evidently, the deceased’s utterance about the accused’s
                    unsatisfactory sexual prowess was sudden and totally unexpected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is clear that both ocular and verbal
                    conduct can constitute provocation. The more vexing question is whether the
                    provocation was grave enough such that an ordinary person of the same sex and
                    age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of
                    the provocation, would have been so provoked as to lose self control. Can words
                    of this nature amount to a grave provocation? In determining what is grave, a
                    number of authorities helpfully illuminate the position. In <em>Gour</em>, it is noted (at p 2498):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Provocation must also be
                            “grave”.</b>—Not only must the provocation be
                        sudden, but it must also be grave, and as remarked before, its gravity will
                        be measured by the deprivation of self-control in which it must have
                        resulted. Now, before a provocation can be said to be “grave”,
                        it must be one which the Court recognizes as sufficient to arouse a
                        person’s passions. It must, in fact, be a provocation which, though
                        not intolerable, is sufficiently serious to explain the act. <em>From this, it, of course, follows that the feeling had an
                            adequate cause</em>. This implies that the provocative act was
                        either illegal, or one which, though legal, was improper. Where the act is
                        neither the one nor the other, there is no legal cause justifying the
                        provocation. [emphasis in bold in original, emphasis added in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>Dhanno Khan v State of
                        UP</em> AIR 1957 ALL 317, the Allahabad High Court
                    explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Each little provocation cannot be called grave simply because the
                        consequences ensuing from that provocation at the hands of the accused have
                        been grave. The provocation must be such as will upset not merely a hasty,
                        hot-tempered and hyper-sensitive person but would upset also a person of
                        ordinary sense and calmness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Who is a reasonable man for the purposes of
                    the objective test? The concept of a reasonable person losing self-control was
                    not clearly articulated by the framers of the Penal Code. When the Indian courts
                    first began applying the concept found in the English common law at the time,
                    they realised that a purely objective test would be inoperable and would create
                    injustice if applied to a multi–cultural, multi-religious, and multi-class
                    structured society like the one in India: see <em>Nanavati</em> at [82] and Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    We would take the
                            opportunity to explain that, subject to what we say further below, the
                            test is normally and primarily an objective one. As Lord Diplock in

                            taunt is founded are true than it would be if they were not. <em>It would stultify much of the mitigation of the previous

                                take into consideration all those factors which in their opinion
                                would affect the gravity of taunts or insults when applied to the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold and italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It seems obvious to us that the conduct of the
                    accused must be assessed by reference to the reasonable person with a broadly
                    similar background rather than some imaginary individual travelling on some
                    means of public transport. No single abstract standard of reasonableness can be
                    laid down. This is a fact- centric assessment that has to be made in the context
                    of the established facts. It is now settled that there are at least two types of
                    characteristics which the court can take into account in assessing whether the
                    objective test has been met, namely characteristics affecting a similarly placed
                    reasonable man’s level of self-control and characteristics affecting the
                    gravity of the provocation. However, an accused’s exceptional hot temper
                        <em>alone should not</em> be taken to exonerate an
                    exceedingly violent response. In <em>Camplin</em>,
                    Lord Diplock with his customary acuity explained the rationale for this (at
                    716F):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The public policy that underlay the adoption of the “reasonable
                        man” test in the common law doctrine of provocation was to reduce the
                        incidence of fatal violence by preventing a person relying upon his own
                        exceptional pugnacity or excitability as an excuse for loss of
                        self-control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In similar vein, in <em>Mahmood</em>, Dhavan J penetratingly observed (at 542):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law cannot permit ill-temper and similar abnormalities to become
                        assets for the purpose of committing murder, for if it did, “a bad
                        tempered man will be entitled to a lighter verdict of manslaughter where a
                        good tempered one would be convicted for murder” Avory, J. in
                        Rex v. Lesbini, (1914) 3 KB 1116.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, with regard to the gravity of the
                    provocation, the court can take into account <em>any</em>
                    of the accused’s personal characteristics which affect the gravity of the
                    provocation. In his seminal article on <em>The Doctrine of
                        Provocation</em> [1976] CLJ 292, Professor Andrew
                    Ashworth clarified the position (at 299–300):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If it is accepted that a primary purpose of the “reasonable
                        man” test is to ascertain whether the accused showed reasonable
                        self-control in the face of the provocation given, then it follows that
                        individual deficiencies of temperament and mentality must be left out of
                        account. On the other hand, a proper application of the standard does
                        involve the jury in assessing the degree and gravity of the provocation. How
                        can the gravity of provocation be measured? The first point, which could
                        almost be described as a matter of definition if it had not been judicially
                        challenged, is that it rarely makes sense to describe a provocation as
                        simply “grave.” Perhaps it makes sense with serious assaults,
                        which may be universally perceived as gravely provoking; but in general a
                        provocation can only be described as “'grave” in relation to
                        persons of a particular class. <em>Thus the sight of two
                            persons indulging in sexual intercourse cannot properly be
                            </em><em>described as a grave provocation—for
                            it would hardly provoke the </em><em>unrelated
                            intruder to anything more than embarrassment—without adding that
                            it would be grave for someone who is married, engaged or related to one
                            of the participants.</em> Similarly, to say that throwing a
                        pigskin shoe is a grave provocation would be incorrect as a general
                        proposition: but it would be grave to a Moslem. And to describe knocking a
                        person's crutch away as a grave provocation only makes sense in relation to
                        a person who relies on a crutch. <b><em>To be meaningful, the
                            “gravity” of provocation must be expressed in relation to
                            persons in a particular situation or group." For this reason it is
                            essential and inevitable that the accused's personal characteristics
                            should be considered by the court. The proper distinction, it is
                            submitted, is that individual peculiarities which bear on the gravity of
                            the provocation should be taken into account, whereas individual
                            peculiarities bearing on the accused's level of self-control should
                            not.</em></b> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Attorney General for
                        Jersey v Holley</em> [2005] 2 AC 580 (“<em>Holley</em>”), Lord Nicholls observed as follows (at
                    [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence if a homosexual man is taunted for his homosexuality it
                        is for the jury to consider whether a homosexual man having ordinary powers
                        of self-control might, in comparable circumstances, be provoked to lose his
                        self-control and react to the provocation as the defendant did. Authority
                        for this proposition, if needed, is the “glue-sniffer” case of
                        R v Morhall [1996] AC 90. There the deceased nagged the defendant about his
                        addiction to glue-sniffing. The problem before the House of Lords was
                        whether this addiction should have been taken into account at the
                        defendant's trial as affecting the gravity of the provocation: see
                        p 97D. Lord Goff of Chieveley, with whose speech all members of
                        the House agreed, said it should. The thrust of his reasoning was that, for
                        this purpose, “the entire factual situation” was to be taken
                        into account. This includes matters not falling strictly within the
                        description “characteristics”. It also includes matters which
                        are discreditable to the defendant. Lord Goff said, at
                        p 99:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“suppose that a man who has been in prison for a sexual
                            offence, for example rape, has after his release been taunted by another
                            man with reference to that offence. It is difficult to see why, on
                            ordinary principles, his characteristic or history as an offender of
                            that kind should not be taken into account as going to the gravity of
                            the provocation.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>Holley</em>, the
                    Privy Council also approved of an earlier decision in <em>Luc
                        Thiet Thuan v R</em> [1996] 2 All ER 1033, where it was held that
                    the accused’s mental abnormality, unless it formed the subject of the
                    taunts, is not a relevant characteristic for the purposes of the objective test.
                    In <em>Johari</em>, this court made it clear (at [94]) that
                    the <em>Holley</em> approach is part of Singapore law. At
                    this juncture, it bears mention for completeness that <em>Holley</em> is no longer the cornerstone of the law on provocation in
                    England following the introduction of the partial defence of loss of
                    self-control by s 54 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (c 25)(UK). These
                    changes appear to have been precipitated by long-standing problems with
                    provocation, including the criticism that the defence is not underpinned by any
                    clear rationale and problems with the concept of loss of control in relation to
                    the “slow burn” type of cases. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the present case, the accused’s
                    counsel asserted that the fact that he suffered from ADHD, which made him more
                    easily provoked and prone to rage outbursts, should be taken into account in
                    assessing the gravity of the provocation. This argument is untenable as this
                    deficiency had, on the basis of the evidence, no apparent nexus whatsoever to
                    the subject matter of the provocation. Besides this, his satisfactory work
                    history appeared to militate against the likelihood of this being a significant
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     We accept, however, that the accused’s
                    mental background may to an extent be taken into account in assessing the
                    gravity of the provocation. In <em>Nanavati</em>, the
                    Indian Supreme Court held at 628 and 630:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Empress v Khogayi</em>, ILR
                        2 Mad 122, at p.123...The learned Judges observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">What is required is that it should be of a character to deprive the
                            offender of his self-control. In determining whether it was so, it is
                            admissible to take into account the condition of mind in which the
                            offender was at the time of the provocation.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The mental background created by the previous act of the victim
                        may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act
                        caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Kwan Cin
                        Cheng</em>, this court agreed (at [50]) that the accused’s
                    emotional state and mental background leading to it could be taken into account
                    in assessing the gravity of the provocation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, we were of the view that the emotional state of mind
                        of the respondent could properly have been taken into account. The
                        respondent was in love with the deceased and was pleading with her to come
                        back to him. In the words used in Camplin and Ithinin, his emotional state
                        affected the “gravity of the provocation” by the deceased as
                        it made her callous remarks harder to bear. Such an emotional state cannot
                        be considered a unique “peculiarity” of the respondent which
                        diminished his powers of self-control below that expected from the ordinary
                        person and which should be excluded according to Luc Thiet Thuan. The
                        learned trial judge found that the respondent was not normally an aggressive
                        person; his emotional state at the material time was a temporary reaction to
                        the deceased's recent break-up with him after a long courtship, and in
                        applying the objective test in Vijayan, the “reasonable man”
                        must be placed in the same circumstances and background events as the
                        respondent and hence would in all likelihood have been experiencing much the
                        same mental anguish as the respondent's. It would have been absurd to apply
                        the objective test by comparing the respondent's reaction with a
                        hypothetical man of his age and sex but in good spirits and with no
                        sentimental feelings for the deceased. <b>The deceased's
                            provocative words could not be artificially viewed in isolation; their
                            effects on the respondent had to be considered along with the events of
                            the preceding days, and there is ample authority holding that earlier
                            events and the “mental background” they created in the
                            accused may be relevant: </b><em>Mat Sawi bin

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It follows that the deceased’s taunt
                    that the man in the red tee shirt was a better lover than the accused ought not
                    to be viewed in isolation, and its effects on the accused must be considered
                    against the background of their strained relationship and the events that
                    transpired earlier that day. <em>It was clear that the accused
                        loved the deceased passionately although their relationship was nothing
                        short of tumultuous. </em><em>He has both a possessive
                        and obsessive personality and is prone to emotional outbursts.</em>
                    The accused had brought her to meet his parents, met her frequently and often
                    had sex with her. He had also met both her parents, professed his love for the
                    deceased and promised to marry her. Further, he had also manifested his
                    commitment to her repeatedly despite the ever present turbulence in their
                    relationship. It may be recalled that in May 2008, he had wanted to take up a
                    part-time course in Petroleum and Chemical Process Technology at ITE College
                    East but sacrificed his own studies because the deceased had wanted to resit her
                    GCE “O” Level examination but had no money to do so (see [7]
                    above). He went so far as to lie to his grandmother that he needed money to pay
                    for his tuition fees and when the latter gave him a gold bangle to be pawned, he
                    gave the money to the deceased for her studies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> He had bought
                    the deceased a “Thali”, a Hindu nuptial chain, to symbolise that
                    she was his wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Even after the deceased
                    made the police report against him for raping her, they reconciled and continued
                    to see each other and again revived their intimate relationship. In fact, on
                    5 July 2008, just two days before the killing, the accused and the deceased
                    went to Sentosa and spent the night together in a tent where they had
                        sex.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> In addition, <em>only
                        minutes before killing her</em>, the accused told the deceased’s
                    mother that he wanted to marry the deceased and “see [her] face
                        everyday”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> He also said that he used
                    to join gangs in the past but had changed after meeting the deceased and also
                    started going to church every Saturday under her influence. It was clear that,
                    tragically, their lives had become intensely and inextricably
                    intertwined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The deceased’s taunt ought, in the
                    prevailing circumstances, to be viewed in the context of her previous occasions
                    of infidelity and the fact that the accused had just earlier that day seen the
                    deceased behaving intimately with the man in the red tee shirt on the morning of
                    the killing. In <em>Kwan Cin Cheng</em>, this Court noted
                    (at [72]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Romantic and sexual relationships arouse the strongest
                            of human emotions</em></b>
<em>.</em> Even
                        assuming that the respondent reacted in particular to his understanding that
                        the deceased was happy in bed with her new boyfriend, this alone could not
                        result in him failing the objective test; it is hardly unusual for a man to
                        be preoccupied with the sexual fidelity of his lover, and to assume the
                        worst if told that she was happily in love with someone else. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We note that the Judge after citing <em>Kwan Cin Cheng</em> and <em>Ithinin</em>
                    found (GD at [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Undoubtedly, the deceased’s words as recounted by the accused had an
                        impact on him. They were lovers, and she was telling him not only that she
                        was seeing another person, but she considered that person to be a better
                        lover than him. <b>A reasonable man in his position would be
                            hurt by that, but not so enraged that he would lose his power or
                            self-control. It could be different if she had said something personal
                            about him, eg, he was a poor lover or ridiculed him for any sexual
                            deficiencies that he might have.</b> Yet all that she is alleged
                        to have said was that the other man was a better lover. On an objective
                        review of that, the second objective requirement in Exception 1 is not
                        satisfied. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the Judge was mistaken in concluding that all she said
                    was the other person was a “better lover” and that the words
                    uttered could not amount to a grave provocation. First, it is far from clear
                    what “reasonable man” the Judge used as a yardstick to assess the
                    “reasonableness” of the accused’s reaction. Do the words
                        “<em>in his position</em>” refer to his
                    background or the incident alone or both? In our view, the test is a contextual
                    one that must take into account the accused’s background and all relevant
                    circumstances (see [58] and [59] above). Second, here the deceased did not, as
                    the accused had expected, seek forgiveness for her tryst with the man in the red
                    tee shirt, as she had done when the accused confronted her about her
                    relationship with Kesh. Instead, when confronted she had angrily ridiculed him
                    by asserting that the accused’s sexual prowess was poorer than that of the
                    man in the red tee shirt and had sought to justify her infidelity on this
                    ground. This utterance was the proverbial last straw for the accused. <em>Considering the accused’s intensely passionate feelings for
                        the deceased and the fact that he expected to reconcile with her and marry
                        her, it was more probable than not that the deceased’s taunt that the
                        man in the red tee shirt was a “better lover” than he
                        transported his passions to such an extent that he entirely lost his self
                        control momentarily.</em> Unlike the Judge, we conclude that in the
                    heat of the moment and in the context of the unfortunate couple’s
                    overwhelming emotional turbulence, an objective review of the facts suggests
                    that the requirement that the provocation be ‘grave’ in
                    Exception 1 was satisfied. In arriving at this conclusion, we take into
                    account the fact that the Prosecution accepts the accused’s version of
                    what immediately transpired prior to his frenetic stabbing of the
                        deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> For completeness, we should
                    point out that the Prosecution, quite correctly, has not suggested that
                    proportionality was a key consideration in factually assessing the availability
                    of the defence in a matter such as this. On this point, we need only reiterate
                    what this Court stated in <em>Kwan Cin Cheng</em> on this
                    issue, at [69]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In practice, an inquiry into “proportionality” does little
                        to answer the essential question of whether an ordinary person would, upon
                        receiving the provocation in question, have lost his self control to this
                        extent and reacted as the accused did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Accordingly, we find that the accused had
                    satisfied both the subjective and objective tests of the partial defence of
                    provocation, and that this reduces his charge from murder to culpable homicide
                    not amounting to murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As for the partial defence of diminished
                    responsibility, we found that this was not substantiated. Although Dr Tan
                    had found that the accused had ADHD, we preferred the opinion of Dr Kua,
                    which was strongly supported by the objective evidence. Even if the accused had
                    ADHD, it was not established that it had substantially impaired his mental
                    responsibility for the murder of the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     For the reasons stated, we find on the balance
                    of probabilities the accused has made out the defence of grave and sudden
                    provocation. Accordingly, we set aside the conviction on the charge of murder
                    and convict the accused on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder
                    punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. We will hear counsel on the
                    appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused.</p>
