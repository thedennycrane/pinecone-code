        The plaintiffs, Philip Motha Consultancy Pte

Ltd ("PMC"), a real estate agency, claimed from the defendants, Jones Lang

Lasalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd ("JLL"), another real estate agency, the

sum of $270,146.25. PMC asserted that this sum was due to them under the terms of their

co-broking agreement with JLL in 1995 for the en bloc sale of a number of properties in

Devonshire Road. I dismissed PMC’s claim and now set out the reasons for my decision.</font>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        In the middle of 1995, Mr Philip Motha,

PMC’s chairman, proposed to Mr Colin Moore, JLL’s then managing director, that

their companies enter into a co-broking arrangement for the en bloc sale of a number of

properties in Devonshire Road (the "Devonshire properties"). It is pertinent to

note that when these discussions between Mr Motha and Mr Moore took place, neither PMC nor

JLL had any mandate from the owners of the Devonshire properties to sell the said

properties on an en bloc basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        By April 1996, PMC had obtained a mandate from

the owners of the Devonshire properties for the en bloc sale of their properties. PMC and

JLL agreed to market the said properties together and Mr Terence Tang, JLL’s then

senior manager in the investment sales department, outlined the terms of the co-broking

agreement in a letter to PMC on 23 April 1996. He stated in his letter that the two

parties would share the advertising costs as well as PMC’s "commission"

from the en bloc sale equally. PMC’s project consultant, Mr Ang Boon Hua, accepted

the terms by signing a copy of Mr Tang’s letter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        Tenders were called for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties. On 29 May 1996, Grandwin Investment Pte Ltd ("Grandwin")

submitted a tender bid for the said properties and paid a tender fee of $900,000. However,

they withdrew their tender bid on 10 June 1996 and their tender fee was forfeited. PMC

received 30% of the forfeited sum, which amounted to $270,000, under their arrangements

with the owners of the Devonshire properties. They instructed their solicitors, Ms Tang

&amp; Partners, to pay half of this sum to JLL. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        Further attempts by PMC and JLL to jointly sell

the Devonshire properties did not bear fruit and by late August 1996, PMC’s mandate

from the owners of these properties for an en bloc sale expired. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Shortly after the expiry of PMC’s mandate

to sell the Devonshire properties, the owners of the said properties entered into a

collective sale agreement and appointed JLL as their marketing agents for a period of

three months with effect from 12 September 1996. JLL did not manage to sell the said

properties within the period fixed in this collective agreement. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The owners of the Devonshire properties did not

give up trying to achieve higher returns by having an en bloc sale of their properties. In

1997, they appointed another firm of real estate agents, M/s Edmund Tie &amp; Co, as their

exclusive agents for the en bloc sale of their properties. However, no suitable buyer for

the said properties was found.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        Two years later, in 1999, the owners of the

Devonshire properties approached JLL once again to handle the en bloc sale of their

properties. In September 1999, JLL succeeding in selling these properties and earned a

commission for their work.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        On 1 October 1999, PMC’s Mr Motha wrote to

JLL, claiming that his company was entitled to half of the commission earned by JLL for

the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties. JLL did not reply to this letter as they

thought that PMC’s claim was ludicrous. More than one and a half years later, PMC

wrote to JLL again on 3 May 2001 to claim half of the commission in question. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        On 29 May 2001, PMC invoiced JLL for half of

the commission earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties in

September 1999. For the first time, PMC also sought a refund of the amount paid to JLL in

1996 with respect to the forfeited tender fee of Grandwin. As JLL resisted both claims,

PMC instituted this action against them. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The commission for the en bloc

sale</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        PMC’s claim for a share of the commission

earned by JLL in 1999 for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties will first be

considered. PMC asserted that an oral agreement in the middle of 1995 gave them a right to

share JLL’s commission. They contended that this oral agreement was confirmed in a

letter dated 19 October 1995 from their chairman, Mr Motha, to JLL. The said letter was in

the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We like to thank you for your

    verbal agreement in this co-broking arrangement that in spite of and even in the event of

    any interruption whatsoever including the termination/expiry of our option to find a

    buyer, followed by subsequent renewal of such options, or in subsequent collective

    agreements by the owners in which you are appointed to sell, this arrangement of

    co-broking/[co-operation] between the two of our companies continues until the properties

    or part thereof are finally sold by you as earlier verbally arranged, when we mentioned

    that the costs of advertisements as well as the commission would be split 50/50 between

    us.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        There are many reasons why PMC cannot rely on

the above-mentioned letter. To begin with, JLL denied ever having received the said

letter. PMC’s Mr Ang, who said that the said letter was sent by ordinary post,

admitted that JLL never acknowledged receipt of it. JLL’s former managing director,

Mr Pan Tien Chor, stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the letter could have

been recently fabricated to bolster PMC’s claim. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        Secondly, the owners of the Devonshire

properties had not appointed PMC as their agents for the en bloc sale of their properties

in July 1995. As such, it is unlikely that there was an oral co-broking arrangement in

July 1995. JLL’s Mr Pan explained the position as follows in paragraph 14 of his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[I]n all my years of experience

    as a property consultant, I have never entered into a co-broking agreement with another

    property consultant where neither of us had obtained the prior authority from the owners

    to market the properties. To the best of my knowledge, it is very unusual for property

    consultants to do so.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        Thirdly, even if there was an oral agreement in

mid-1995, it was superseded by the terms of the written agreement between the parties in

April 1996. The terms of this written agreement, which were contained in a letter dated 23

April 1996 from JLL’s Mr Tang to PMC’s Mr Motha, were stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SALE OF LAND AT DEVONSHIRE ROAD</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is to confirm that you are

    agreeable to co-broke with [JLL] on the above and [JLL] will share 50% of <i><u>your</u> </i>commission.

    The advertising expenses incurred for the tender sale will also be equally [borne] by

    yourself and [JLL].</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        The terms of the written agreement of 23 April

1996 differed from the terms of the alleged oral agreement of July 1995. In view of

section 94 of the Evidence Act, Cap 97, PMC cannot rely on oral terms which are

inconsistent with the terms of this written contract to establish that they are entitled

to a share of JLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties in

1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        A fourth reason for holding that the alleged

July 1995 oral agreement did not exist is that Mr Motha himself made no reference to this

agreement when he first wrote to JLL’s Mr Pan on 1 October 1999 to claim a share of

JLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the Devonshire properties. That letter was

in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><u>Co-broking arrangement –

    Devonshire Road properties</u></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We would like to congratulate you

    for having finally succeeded in concluding a sale of above properties.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You will recall that one day in

    your office room after the first occasion when the sale did not succeed, our Mr Riechard

    Ang had informed you that our company would take legal action against an owner Loh Siok

    Hong.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You will recall that on that

    occasion you did encourage our Mr Riechard Ang not to take legal action against Loh Siok

    Hong saying that if we took legal action against him and if later on the subject of the

    sale of the Devonshire Road properties was revived and then succeed, our share of the

    commission would not be included. But if we did not take the intended legal action, then

    we have a share in the commission for a subsequent successful sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Based on you encouragement, we

    did not proceed with the intended legal action against Loh Siok Hong.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now that the sale is successful

    we hope eventually you would let us have our share of the commission.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We would like to thank you very

    much and Best Regards.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        If there was an oral agreement which gave PMC

the right to 50% of the commission earned by JLL in 1999, surely Mr Motha would have

referred to it in his letter. Instead, he referred to a promise made by JLL’s Mr Pan

to share any future commission earned by JLL if PMC did not sue Mr Loh. If PMC was

entitled to 50% of the commission to be earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties at anytime in the future, JLL would have had no right to deprive PMC

of their share of the commission regardless of whether or not Mr Loh was sued. In any

case, JLL’s Mr Pan categorically denied having promised to pay anything to PMC if the

latter did not sue Mr Loh. His evidence was not challenged when he was cross-examined. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        A fifth reason for supporting JLL’s

contention that there was no oral agreement in mid-1995, as alleged by PMC, is that the

terms of the alleged agreement are so one-sided that no reasonable estate agent would have

accepted them. In paragraph 9 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, JLL’s Mr Pan

explained the position in the following rather persuasive terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Even if, which is denied, the

    Plaintiffs made such a proposal to the Defendants, I would not have agreed to the same for

    the following reasons (i) such a proposal was one-sided and only favoured the Plaintiffs

    because if the Plaintiffs were the ones to ultimately sell the properties after the

    termination/expiry of the Options, the Defendants would not be entitled to a share of

    their profits; (ii) to enter into such an indefinite agreement would essentially prevent

    the Defendants from marketing the properties in the future when circumstances and market

    conditions changed; and (iii) in all my years of experience, neither I nor the Defendants

    had ever entered into or agreed to such onerous terms in a co-broking agreement. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        I thus hold without any hesitation whatsoever

that it has not been established that there was an oral agreement in mid-1995 on the basis

of the terms of Mr Motha’s letter dated 19 October 1995. That being the case, the

claim by PMC for a share of JLL’s commission must be viewed in the context of the

terms stated in JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        If all the circumstances of the case are taken

into account, JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996 does not lend any support to PMC’s

claim for a share of the commission earned by JLL in 1999 for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties. Admittedly, the duration of the co-broking arrangement was not

mentioned in the letter of 23 April 1996. However, the context in which the co-broking

arrangement was made provides ample evidence as to its duration. The raison d’tre

for this co-broking arrangement was that PMC had by that date a mandate from the owners of

the Devonshire properties to sell their properties on an en bloc basis. PMC was thus the

party to be paid a commission if the en bloc sale succeeded and JLL was merely lending

their brand name to the en bloc sale. That is why JLL’s letter of 23 April 1996

specifically referred to the sharing of PMC’s commission and not JLL’s

commission. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        Once PMC’s mandate from the owners of the

Devonshire properties with respect to the en bloc sale expired by the end of August 1996,

the question of co-broking no longer arose. JLL’s Mr Pan explained the position in

paragraph 13 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[I]n my experience as a property

    consultant, changes in market conditions are inevitable and it would not be prudent for

    any property consultant to be bound to a co-broke arrangement for such an indefinite time.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        PMC did not furnish any credible evidence that

JLL continued to work with them on a co-broking basis for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties after 1996. In fact, other estate agents, namely M/s Edmund Tie

&amp; Co, had been invited by the owners of the said properties to find an en bloc buyer

for the properties after the expiry of PMC’s mandate to sell the properties. As such,

when JLL returned to the scene in 1999 after other estate agents had failed to sell the

properties on an en bloc basis, they were acting solely for their own benefit. In view of

this, PMC’s claim for a share of the commission earned by JLL for the en bloc sale of

the Devonshire properties in 1999 is dismissed.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The forfeited Grandwin tender fee</font></p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        I now turn to PMC’s claim for a refund of

the amount paid by them to JLL in July 1996 with respect to the forfeiture of

Grandwin’s tender fee. PMC asserted that their agreement with JLL, as evidenced in

the latter’s letter to them dated on 23 April 1996, was only to share any commission

earned and advertising expenses. They contended that as the forfeited tender fee was not a

"commission" earned by them, JLL had no claim to it. On the other hand, JLL

contended that the term "commission", as used in the co-broking agreement,

includes forfeited tender fees. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        It was common ground that PMC’s claim is

one for money had and received. In this context, it is worth noting that in <i>Brisbane v

Dacres </i>(1813) 5 Taunt 143, 150, Gibbs J said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I think that where a man demands

    money of another as a matter of right, and that other with a full knowledge of the facts

    upon which the demand is founded, has paid a sum, he never can recover back the sum he has

    so voluntarily paid…. If we were to hold otherwise, many inconveniences may arise;

    …. I think that by submitting to the demand, he that pays the money gives it to the

    person to whom he pays it, and makes it his, and closes the transaction between them. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        PMC paid JLL half of their own share of

Grandwin’s forfeited tender fee with full knowledge of the facts upon which

JLL’s claim to the said fee was founded. Mr Ang’s evidence that he told Mr Pan

that PMC would subsequently seek a refund of the amount paid to JLL cannot be accepted. In

fact, on 2 July 1996, PMC instructed M/s Tang &amp; Partners to pay JLL without any hint

that the money was being paid under protest. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        It should not be overlooked that although JLL

was paid half of the forfeited tender fee in July 1996, PMC did not complain that JLL was

not entitled to the amount paid until almost five years later. They had ample

opportunities to do so earlier on. When PMC’s chairman, Mr Motha, wrote to JLL on 1

October 1999 to claim a share of the latter’s commission for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties, he made no reference to Gandwin’s forfeited tender fee.

Furthermore, two years later, when Mr Motha informed JLL that PMC’s lawyers will be

handling their claim for a share of JLL’s commission for the en bloc sale of the

Devonshire properties, no mention was made of PMC’s right to recover the forfeited

tender fee. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        To sum up, although JLL’s letter of 23

March 1996 could have been better drafted, I accept that it was understood that the

sharing arrangement extended to forfeited tender fees. I thus hold that PMC is not

entitled to claim from JLL the amount paid to the latter in July 1996 with respect to

Grandwin’s forfeited tender fee.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Costs</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        As both the claims made by PMC were dismissed,

JLL are entitled to costs.</font></p>
