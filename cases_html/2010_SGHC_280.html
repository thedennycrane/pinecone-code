                    leave to appeal against a summary determination of issues (“the

                    in SIAC Arbitration No 069/DA17/05 (“the Arbitration”). The
                    plaintiff, Holland Leedon (“the Vendor”), is the respondent in the
                    Arbitration, while the defendant, Metalform Asia Pte Ltd (“the
                    Purchaser”). The dispute between the parties relate to the interpretation
                    of terms in an agreement between the parties for the sale and purchase of the
                    Vendor’s business (“the SPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arbitration Act</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Appeal against award</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49. —(1)   A party to arbitration proceedings may
                        (upon notice to the other parties and to the arbitral tribunal) appeal to

                                    importance and the decision of the arbitral tribunal is at least
                                    open to serious doubt; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    despite the agreement of the parties to
                                resolve the matter by arbitration, it is just and proper in all the
                                circumstances for the Court to determine the question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    An application for leave to appeal under this
                            section shall identify the question of law to be determined and state
                            the grounds on which it is alleged that leave to appeal should be
                            granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The present application turns on subsections
                    (2), (5) and (6). I will deal with each in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 49(2): exclusion of appellate jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Purchaser argued that the parties had agreed
                    to exclude the appellate jurisdiction of the court granted by s 49(1) by
                    virtue of cll 21.2, 21.6 and 21.7 of the SPA, which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">21.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In the event that any disagreement, dispute,
                            controversy of claim (the “Dispute”) is not resolved
                            amicably between the parties, then, save as otherwise provided in this
                            Agreement, such Dispute shall be settled exclusively and finally by
                            arbitration. It is specifically understood and agreed that, save as
                            otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Dispute that cannot be
                            resolved between the parties, including any matter relating to the
                            interpretation of this Agreement, shall be submitted to arbitration
                            irrespective of the magnitude thereof and the amount in dispute or
                            whether such Dispute would otherwise be considered justifiable or ripe
                            for resolution by any court. This Agreement and the rights and
                            obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall remain in full
                            force and effect pending the award in such arbitration proceedings, and
                            the award shall determine whether and when the termination of this
                            Agreement, if relevant, shall become effective.</span></p>

                            arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I can see nothing in cl 21.2 which avails
                    the Purchaser. As for cl 21.6, the Purchaser argues that the clause
                    excludes the jurisdiction of the court by providing that the decision or award
                    shall be “final and binding”. I am unable to agree. In every
                    arbitration agreement there must be some form of words providing for the binding
                    effect of the award. It would not be sensible to construe such words as serving
                    the further function of excluding an appeal – otherwise parties to every
                    arbitration agreement would have to positively provide for a right of appeal.
                    This would be contrary to the tenor of s 49(1) and (2), which provide for a
                    right of appeal in the first place, which the parties may then exclude. So, in
                    my view, the exclusion of the right of appeal must be effected through something
                    more than a provision which merely provides for the binding effect of the
                    arbitral award. On the facts, I appreciate that the word “final”
                    can, read alone, be taken to be that something more, but reading
                    clause 21.6 as a whole I think that the overall effect of the clause is
                    merely to provide for the binding effect of the arbitral award. I am fortified
                    in this conclusion by the <em>dicta</em> of Ramsey J
                    in <em>Essex County Council v Premier Recycling Ltd</em>
                    [2006] EWHC 3594 at [22] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the use of the words ‘final and binding’, in terms of
                        reference of the arbitration are of themselves insufficient to amount to an
                        exclusion of appeal. Such a phrase is just as appropriate, in my judgment to
                        mean final and binding subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act
                        1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I turn now to cl 21.7. The Purchaser
                    submitted that cl 21.7 tracks s 45 of the Act, which provides in
                    material part as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Determination of preliminary point of
                        law</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>45</b>. —(1) Unless otherwise agreed by
                        the parties, the Court may, on the application of a party to the arbitration
                        proceedings who has given notice to the other parties, determine any
                        question of law arising <em>in the course of the
                            proceedings</em> which the Court is satisfied substantially
                        affects the rights of one or more of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is a linguistic argument, and ordinarily the court will not
                    engage in fine linguistic distinctions when construing commercial contracts
                    – a relevant example being the construction of the scope of arbitration
                    agreements. In this case, however, the Act draws a distinction between a
                    party’s right to apply to court to “determine any question of law
                    arising <em>in the course of</em> the proceedings”,
                    contained in s 45(1), and a party’s right to appeal to court
                    “on a question of law arising <em>out of an
                        award</em> made in the proceedings”, contained in s 49(1).
                    The precise language adopted by the parties is therefore important. On the
                    facts, cl 21.7 only relates to “questions of law arising <em>in the course of</em> any arbitration” (emphasis
                    added). This, in my view, is referable only to s 45(1) and is insufficient
                    to exclude the right of appeal in s 49(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 49(5): Merits and public importance, <em>etc</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I turn now to s 49(5), which lays down the
                    requirements to be satisfied before leave can be granted. There is no serious
                    dispute that s 49(5)(a) and (b) are satisfied. The main issue is
                    s 49(5)(c), which lays down the threshold of merit which must be met. There
                    are two alternative thresholds: either (i) on the basis of the findings of fact
                    in the award the decision of the arbitral tribunal is obviously wrong, or (ii)
                    on the basis of the findings in the award the question is one of general public
                    importance and the decision of the arbitral tribunal is at least open to serious
                    doubt. As is apparent, the threshold is lower when the question of law sought to
                    be presented on appeal is of general public importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the facts, there were three questions of law
                    put to the learned arbitrator. It is not necessary to rehearse them here.
                    Essentially they come to this. The SPA computed the purchase price for the
                    Vendor’s business via the commonly used mechanism of applying a multiplier
                    to the Vendor’s EBIDTA, <em>ie</em>, earnings before
                    interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation. The EBIDTA was not based simply on
                    the relevant audited financial statements. Instead it was to be derived from the
                    agreed completion accounts jointly prepared by the accountants of both parties.
                    See Robert Thompson, gen ed, <em>Sinclair on Warranties and
                        Indemnities on Share and Asset Sales</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    7th Ed, 2008) at para 13-04. There is, in the SPA, no warranty as to
                    the final EBIDTA, and quite naturally so since the Purchaser participated in the
                    completion accounts process which yielded the EBIDTA. The purchaser takes the
                    EDIBTA which he agreed to and to which was then applied the agreed multiple to
                    arrive at the purchase price. The underlying business approach reflected here is
                    one of <em>caveat emptor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Vendor is alleged to have breached a number
                    of warranties in the SPA. Under the general law of contract the Purchaser would
                    be able to recover its expectation losses, measured either by the cost of cure
                    or by the diminution in the value of the Vendor’s business. But the
                    Purchaser is arguing that the alleged breaches of warranty would diminish the
                    EBIDTA and correspondingly the purchase price which is a multiple of the EDIBTA.
                    On this basis it is claiming the difference between the purchase price it paid
                    and the purchase price computed on the basis of the (allegedly) reduced EDIBTA
                    multiplied by the multiplier. However, the Purchaser is not challenging the
                    EDIBTA agreed to by the parties, and indeed it could not have done so as there
                    were no warranties as to the EDIBTA, nor fraud or patent error in the completion
                    accounts. In these circumstances, it seems to me that if the Purchaser’s
                    claim was allowed to proceed, it would have the effect of subverting a commonly
                    used mechanism for determining the purchase price in acquisitions of businesses
                    and shares. In my view, therefore, the decision of the learned arbitrator that
                    the Purchaser is allowed to pursue his claim as described is at least open to
                    serious doubt. I am further of the view that the issue, relating as it does to a
                    commonly used commercial pricing mechanism, is one of general public importance.
                    Section 49(5)(c)(ii) is therefore satisfied. I am fortified in my
                    conclusion by the decision of Judith Prakash J’s to strike out the
                    Purchaser’s claims to substantially similar effect against the
                    Vendor’s directors in connection with the same acquisition: see <em>Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Noi</em> [2009]
                    1 SLR(R) 369. The record shows that, on appeal, the Court of Appeal
                    only disagreed with Prakash J to the extent that it thought that leave to
                    amend the untenable claim should be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     For similar reasons, I think it is just and
                    proper in all the circumstances for an appeal to lie to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 49(6): identification of question of law to be
                determined</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Purchaser argued that the Vendor has not
                    formulated or identified any question of law arising from the Decision by the
                    learned arbitrator, and therefore failed to satisfy s 45(6) of the Act.
                    Again I am unable to accede. It is first of all doubtful that s 49(6) of
                    the Act is a condition precedent to the grant of leave (as opposed to a mere
                    procedural requirement), since it is not placed in s 49(5). In any case,
                    the Vendor is clearly disputing the effect of a contractual term, and it is
                    beyond controversy that the true construction of contractual terms is a question
                    of law: <em>Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd v Hyundai
                        Engineering Construction Co Ltd</em> [2005]
                    2 SLR(R) 270.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the result, I grant leave to the Vendor to
                    appeal against the Decision of the learned arbitrator. Costs in the
                    cause.</p>
