The settlement agreement resulted from a dispute between the parties over the claimant’s investments in the first defendant’s business. The claimant’s case is a straightforward enforcement of the settlement agreement. The defendants’ primary case is that the settlement agreement in writing was a sham. The defendants also ran the alternative case that, notwithstanding the presence of an entire agreement clause in the settlement agreement, the parties had orally agreed <span class="font-italic">not</span> to enforce the settlement agreement until the successful “monetisation” of certain alexandrite gemstones which the second defendant had in his possession. As the alexandrite gemstones were never monetised, the defendants claimed that they were not obliged to make the payment under the settlement agreement. The issues in this case requires a consideration of the proper interpretation of s 94(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “EA”). Hitherto, there has not been much judicial consideration on this exception to the parol evidence rule which pertains to evidence to prove an oral condition precedent, and to the effect of an entire agreement clause on the same.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The claimant in this action (“Suit 781”) is Cradle Wealth Solutions Pte Ltd (“Cradle Wealth”), a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of providing management consultancy services.

At trial, Sathish explained that Cradle Wealth’s business involved investing its investors’ moneys in various projects in Singapore and overseas, and securing returns for them. Cradle Wealth’s investors were given shares in Cradle Wealth and became shareholders, and Cradle Wealth had around 50 of such investor-shareholders. As part of the agreement between Cradle Wealth and these investor-shareholders, Cradle Wealth was also obliged to repay the investment moneys.

Furthermore, Cradle Wealth was never a party to the Deed of Mandate and was not involved in assisting in the sale of the Alexandrite Gemstones. Instead, the Defendants worked with Sylvester to find a buyer for the Alexandrite Gemstones, with the Deed of Mandate indirectly allowing Sylvester and Cradle Wealth to earn commissions from any sale of the said Gemstones. In this regard, Cradle Wealth insists that Sathish was kept apprised of the discussions between Nazarisham and Sylvester but did not assist in the attempted monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones.

The Actual Agreement had been made orally and was not recorded in writing at all (see [16] above). As part of the Defendants’ case, they relied heavily on evidence of Sathish and Sylvester’s subsequent conduct in working with Nazarisham to attempt to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones. There would have been no need for Sathish and Sylvester to have actively done so, if the Settlement Agreement was intended to be legally binding and intended to constitute the entire agreement between the parties. Cradle Wealth could simply have waited until 29 June 2020 for the Defendants to make good on their obligation to pay the Settlement Sum under cl 1(1) of the Settlement Agreement.

Equally important to the principle of fairness, pleadings also serve to uphold the rules of natural justice and prevent a trial by ambush (<span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T</span><span class="font-italic"> M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 524 at [94]). The general rule is therefore that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span>at [38]). Nonetheless, the court is not required to adopt an overly formalistic and inflexible rule-bound approach. The overarching enquiry is one of irreparable prejudice, or, in other words, prejudice that cannot be compensated by costs (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> at [40]).

It will generally be for the party advancing the unpleaded claim to show that there is no prejudice and this could be shown, for instance, by establishing that the issue was raised in evidence, it was clearly appreciated by the other party, and no reasonable objections were taken at the trial to such evidence being led and the point in question being put into issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I am satisfied that the Defence did at the very least disclose the material facts which would support a defence of sham and gave Cradle Wealth sufficient notice of the case it had to meet, specifically:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the Defendants alleged that the Settlement Agreement was intended to “stave off” Cradle Wealth’s creditors and that such an agreement was needed at the mediation “to appease and assure them”.

Understood as such, this issue had been raised in evidence and put to Cradle Wealth’s witnesses at trial, which further buttresses my conclusion that there was no irreparable prejudice caused to Cradle Wealth from the Defendants’ failure to plead sham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Accordingly, I turn to consider whether the facts disclose a sham.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The classic definition of a sham was provided by Diplock LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</span> [1967] 2 QB 786 at 802C–802E and followed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina and another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1176 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Tiah</span>”) at [73] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I apprehend that, if [the term ‘sham’] has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the ‘sham’ which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think is clear in legal principle, morality and the authorities …, that for acts or documents to be a ‘sham,’ with whatever legal consequences follow from this, <span class="font-italic">all the parties thereto must have a common intention that the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating</span>.

I therefore reject that the Actual Agreement was reached orally at the Café as put forth by the Defendants. The parties did not agree that Cradle Wealth would be entitled to the Settlement Sum only upon monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones.

There is a “very strong presumption” that parties intend to be bound by the provisions of an agreement that they enter into (<span class="font-italic">Chng Bee Kheng</span> at [51]; affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Tiah </span>at [80]).

The same applies with greater force in the context of a properly drafted settlement agreement entered into by the parties who have the benefit of the advice of legal counsel. One does not readily reach the conclusion that parties who were hitherto at loggerheads in a dispute would collude to create a sham document. Likewise, the language used in cl 1(1) of the Settlement Agreement, in particular the reference to “with time being of the essence”, makes little sense if parties had truly intended for the Settlement Agreement to be a sham. In my view, such a clause was more indicative of parties’ intention to <span class="font-italic">ensure </span>payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this context, it is also jarring that the Defendants were wholly unable to produce <span class="font-italic">any </span>contemporaneous (even informal) record in writing showing the terms of the purported Actual Agreement. If indeed the parties ever agreed that Cradle Wealth would not be paid unless the Alexandrite Gemstones were monetised, it is reasonable to expect <span class="font-italic">some</span> form of contemporaneous record referring to the Actual Agreement as such, especially if it was intended to contradict or vary the written terms of the Settlement Agreement.

Such contemporaneous document could have been recorded on the side and would not need to have been shown to Cradle Wealth’s investor-shareholders, which would have protected the Defendants’ interest without compromising the alleged purpose of the Settlement Agreement in staving off Cradle Wealth’s creditors. Furthermore, Mr Lim Tean did not seek the removal of the entire agreement clause in the Settlement Agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cl 5). As legal counsel, he would surely have appreciated the significance of the clause in light of Nazarisham’s assurances to him that there was a “wider” Actual Agreement between the parties.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I am unable to accept the Defendants’ characterisation of the matter. First, it is a far stretch to conclude that Suit 612 was a “bogus” claim and “baseless” simply on the evidence relied upon by the Defendants, namely, that Suit 612 had been commenced on the same day that OS 803 was commenced against Cradle Wealth and that Suit 612 had been quickly discontinued by 29 August 2019

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> At trial, Sathish satisfactorily explained that Suit 612 was withdrawn before the writ had been served on the defendants in that Suit, owing to various inaccuracies in the statement of claim and the computation of the total sum claimed. He attributed these inaccuracies to Cradle Wealth’s former solicitors. Cradle Wealth subsequently hired their present solicitors to commence Suit 940.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Second, the Defendants’ own conduct also gave me reason to doubt their assertion that the claim in breach of contract in Suit 940 for the sum of $7,660,000 was “significantly inflated”. It may be recalled that Nazarisham’s position is that the actual sum owing in Suit 940 was between $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 (see [10] above). Yet it cannot be disputed that the Defendants did in fact execute the Settlement Agreement by which they were prepared to undertake, at least on paper, liability to repay a sum of US$4,000,000 by 29 June 2020. Even by the Defendants’ own case that the Settlement Agreement was merely a sham contract, they were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why they would be willing to undertake liability to repay a sum far in excess of the S$1,000,000 to S$2,000,000 that MTN purportedly owed. It is worth reiterating that the Defendants’ case in respect of sham is that there was an Actual Agreement by which parties agreed that the US$4,000,000 payment would be made to Cradle Wealth, except that this would be done only upon successful monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, the fact that Cradle Wealth faced legal pressure from its investor-shareholders is neither here nor there. The Defendants strenuously contend that Cradle Wealth needed the Settlement Agreement to “stave off” its creditors and that the Settlement Agreement was <span class="font-italic">therefore</span> a sham.

</div>
</div> In my judgement, however, these events would have been equally consistent with Sathish’s explanation that the Settlement Agreement was executed precisely because Cradle Wealth faced legal pressure by its investor-shareholders, and therefore the parties fully intended for the Settlement Agreement to be a legally binding instrument. According to Sathish, Cradle Wealth’s investor-shareholders had set aside the necessary funds to pursue Suit 940 and it was in Cradle Wealth and the investor-shareholders’ best interests to resolve Suit 940 by way of a settlement instead of going through a lengthy and costly trial.

In the telephone conversation between Sathish, Sylvester and Nazarisham on 27 June 2020, Sylvester also alluded to a “group of Sri Lankan buyers” who had been “introduced by [Sathish]” and that Sathish had “passed the communication to [Sylvester]”.

</div> This suggests that Sathish had played some part in the attempts to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones as well, at least by referring certain contacts to Sylvester. I therefore do not accept that Sathish’s conduct could be characterised as merely overseeing Sylvester and/or Nazarisham’s efforts to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Nonetheless, I find that Sylvester played a more active role in the attempts to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones as compared to Sathish. In Sylvester’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he deposed that he had “liaised with [Nazarisham] on the progress of the sales of the [Alexandrite Gemstones]” and would also arrange with Nazarisham for potential buyers to view the Alexandrite Gemstones.

</div> There was also the possibility that the parties could indirectly earn commissions from the sale of the Alexandrite Gemstones (see the arrangement as set out at [18] above), in addition to recovering the Settlement Sum. To my mind, it is eminently reasonable that Sathish and Sylvester wanted to ensure that the Defendants would make good on the Settlement Sum and therefore took steps to have more oversight over this process than if they had merely waited until 29 June 2020 with only the option of restarting litigation again (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by suing on the Settlement Agreement) if the Defendants failed to pay. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that a distinguishing feature of the present case was the goodwill that had been generated by the amicable resolution of Suit 940 (see [46]–[49] above). This goodwill characterised the parties’ subsequent conduct after the mediation <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and offered </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a conceivable explanation for why Sathish </span>and Sylvester were willing to work with the Defendants on the monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones, despite the parties having previously been at dispute in Suit 940.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I therefore do not accept that the parties’ subsequent conduct of working to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones is indicative of the existence of the term of the alleged Actual Agreement as pleaded by the Defendants (namely that the parties had agreed that Cradle Wealth would <span class="font-italic">only</span> be entitled to be paid the sum of US$4,000,000 upon monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones). My conclusion in this regard is buttressed by Nazarisham’s own conduct that suggested that he was cognisant of the looming deadline of 29 June 2020. During the same telephone conversation with Sathish and Sylvester on 27 June 2020 (see [56] above), Nazarisham also asked whether Sylvester’s potential buyers would be interested in buying several <span class="font-italic">other </span>gemstones that Nazarisham had in his possession, namely emerald stones:

For instance, on 16 August 2020, Sylvester asked Nazarisham on the WhatsApp chat group “Comeback Team” that “[Sathish] mentioned to me earlier that you have some emeralds report from Far East as well, can you provide me with some of those?” and stated that “[w]ith the emeralds report from Far East or Nanyang I will be able to push and clear the emeralds more quickly”.

</div> I find this to be consistent with the explanation (at [58] above) that the overarching motivation—or impetus—was to ensure that the Defendants would make good on the Settlement Sum, and thereby allow Cradle Wealth to recover the moneys under the Settlement Agreement expeditiously. On the other hand, Sathish explained that he had by this time limited his participation in the monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones and instructed his lawyers to commence Suit 781 (see [55] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For completeness, I address at this juncture the Defendants’ submission, relying on the parties’ exchange during the 27 June 2020 phone conversation, that the parties had agreed during the day of the mediation to work together to monetise Nazarisham’s Alexandrite Gemstones in order for Cradle Wealth and MTN to both stage a “comeback” in their respective businesses.

It therefore could not be ruled out that Nazarisham was referring to what parties had discussed at the private discussion at the Café.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The reference to a “comeback” is certainly a factor that could have swung either way, being alluded to in rather general and vague terms by the parties during the telephone conversation.

In turn, these commissions could be used to pay Cradle Wealth’s debts, over and above the US$4,000,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Settlement Sum) which Cradle Wealth would become entitled to only upon monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones.

In reaching this conclusion, I reiterate that the factors considered above at [37] to [69] were considered cumulatively rather than individually and I have no difficulty, on this basis, in concluding that the parties never agreed that Cradle Wealth would not be paid unless the Alexandrite Gemstones were successfully monetised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It follows that the Defendants have not discharged the burden of proving that the Settlement Agreement was executed with the common intention that the document was not to create the legal rights and obligations which it gave the appearance of creating.

</div>
</div>
</div> In seeking to clarify the principles relating to entire agreement clauses, the Court of Appeal concluded (at [36]) that this genre of clauses can “therefore be … construed as denuding a collateral warranty of legal effect … and/or by rendering inadmissible extrinsic evidence which reveals terms inconsistent with those in the written contract”. As a general principle, the effect of an entire agreement clause “<span class="font-italic">is essentially a matter of contractual interpretation and will necessarily depend upon its precise wording and context</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [25]). What matters is the construction of the entire agreement clause. If appropriately worded, an entire agreement clause will be “acknowledged and upheld if it clearly purports to deprive any pre-contractual or collateral agreement of legal effect” (at [35]). The Defendants’ reliance on the principles expounded in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>therefore does not advance their case very far, unless the Defendants can sustain an interpretation of cl 5 of the Settlement Agreement that would allow recourse to an oral condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The principles in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>were applied in <span class="font-italic">Wen Wen Food Trading Pte Ltd v Food Republic Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 60 (“<span class="font-italic">Wen Wen Food Trading</span>”), which was an appeal against the decision of the Assistant Registrar to strike out the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety on the ground that the claim was legally unsustainable and therefore “frivolous or vexatious”. The plaintiff’s claim was based in misrepresentation and wrongful repudiation of the food stall license agreement between the parties, alleging that the defendant had made a specific representation that the plaintiff would be able to operate in the defendant’s food-court for a period of at least six years, despite the license agreement stating that the license period was two years. The High Court considered, in addition to the express wording of the license agreement as such, that the license agreement contained an entire agreement clause (cl 30.1) which clearly identified the written agreement as the only source of the parties’ rights and obligations and prevented the plaintiff from contradicting the document with extrinsic evidence: <span class="font-italic">Wen Wen Food Trading </span>at [21]–[23]. On appeal, the plaintiff’s appeal in CA/CA 16/2019 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (with no written grounds of decision rendered). It is relevant for present purposes that the Court of Appeal noted that whilst the facts as pleaded might possibly have given rise to a claim based on an oral collateral contract provable under s 94(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA, such a claim would be precluded by the entire agreement clause in the license agreement which effectively deprived any pre-contractual or collateral agreement of legal effect. Whilst the principles in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>have hitherto not been considered specifically in relation to the interaction between a claim (or defence) based on an oral condition precedent under s 94(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA and an entire agreement clause, I see no reason in principle why it should not likewise apply given that the guidance given in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span> was of general application (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, the Defendants submit that what they considered to be the context and circumstances under which cl 5 was drafted in the Settlement Agreement should be taken into account in construing its effect:

</div>
</div> That case concerned the application of the legal principles in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>on the contextual approach to contractual interpretation under s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the EA (the “<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> principles”) to the <span class="font-italic">true construction </span>of a general indemnity clause in the set of agreements between the parties. In the present case, the proposed interpretation of cl 5 by the Defendants is essentially that its effect should be nullified. In so doing, however, the Defendants have ignored the <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>principles—critically, it is not permissible to use extrinsic evidence to advance a construction that is well <span class="font-italic">outside </span>the scope of the meaning that the actual words of the clause can reasonably bear, much less one that directly contradicts the express words of the clause (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [123] and [132(f)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my view, cl 5 is a clause that clearly purports to deprive any pre-contractual or collateral agreement of legal effect. Clause 5 states that the Settlement Agreement contains the parties’ entire agreement “with regard to the matters set forth herein”. It explicitly states that any “agreements, oral or otherwise” which are not contained in the Settlement Agreement shall be devoid of any force or effect. The alleged condition precedent as pleaded by the Defendants is therefore caught by cl 5, since it is related to the matters covered by the Settlement Agreement and was ostensibly reached by oral agreement. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wen Wen Food Trading</span> had found that any claim based on an oral collateral contract provable under s 94(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA would be precluded by the entire agreement clause in that case. I find in the present case that any claim based on a separate oral agreement constituting a condition precedent provable under s 94(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA is likewise precluded by the entire agreement clause (cl 5) in the Settlement Agreement. The Defendants are therefore precluded from asserting an oral condition precedent to the effect that the Alexandrite Gemstones must be monetised before any payment would become due under the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Defendants can rely on s 94(c) of the EA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, I am also satisfied that a similar conclusion would have been reached even if I did not consider that cl 5 of the Settlement Agreement precludes recourse to an alleged oral condition precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As alluded to above, the parties dispute the proper interpretation of the exception encapsulated in proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to s 94 of the EA which was sought to be relied upon by the Defendants. Cradle Wealth submits that proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is confined to a situation where the condition precedent sought to be proven does not “contradict[t], var[y], ad[d] to, or subtract[t] from” the terms of the Settlement Agreement. In other words, proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is <span class="font-italic">subject to </span>the restriction in the chapeau to s 94 as such. Notwithstanding that this interpretation of proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is not supported by any case law, Cradle Wealth submits that its interpretation is consistent with illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to s 94 of the EA which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  <span class="font-italic">A</span> agrees absolutely in writing to pay <span class="font-italic">B</span> $1,000 on 1st March 1893.

In order that full effect may be given to this, two things are necessary, namely, […] and that if [the document] purports to be a final settlement of a previous negotiation, as in the case of a written contract, it shall be treated as final, and shall not be varied by word of mouth […] If the second rule were not observed people would never know when a question was settled, as they would be able to play fast and loose with their writings … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He further affirmed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… By bearing these leading principles in mind the details and exceptions will become simple. Their practical importance is indeed as nothing in comparison to the importance of the rules which they qualify.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In a similar vein it was observed that the rationale for the parol evidence rule is “grounded on the objective theory of contract and (on a practical level) the attendant promotion of certainty as well as ensuring that only the best evidence possible is admitted” (see Andrew B L Phang &amp; Goh Yihan, <span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore</span> (Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business, 2012) at para 993), cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Tiah </span>at [3]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Bearing these guiding principles in mind, I turn to the proper interpretation of proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to s 94.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) My consideration</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my judgement, the plain reading of proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to s 94 in context does not support Cradle Wealth’s contended interpretation. The principal rule as set out in the chapeau to s 94 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, against admitting extrinsic evidence “for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from” the terms of the written agreement) is <span class="font-italic">subject to</span> provisos (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">f</span>). In other words, derogation from the principal rule in s 94 is permitted where the circumstances described in one or more of the six accompanying provisos are satisfied (see also, <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [71]–[74]). The operation of proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is therefore not subject to the restriction that the evidence sought to be admitted of a condition precedent must not be “for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from” the terms of the written agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Furthermore, adopting Cradle Wealth’s contended interpretation would otherwise render the exception in proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) otiose—or indeed, any of the other exceptions in provisos (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) (putting aside from consideration, proviso (<span class="font-italic">f</span>) which is of a different nature, being not really an exception to s 94 but a fundamental rule of interpretation: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [72]). Simply put, I am unable to see how <span class="font-italic">any </span>extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced by a party under provisos (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) would <span class="font-italic">not </span>have one of the four effects of contradicting, varying, adding to or subtracting from the terms of a written agreement. In this regard, I would keep in mind the rule of construction that Parliament is presumed not to have intended an unworkable or impracticable result, so an interpretation that leads to such a result would not be regarded as a possible one (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38], affirming <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Bank Bhd v Soh Seow Poh</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 525 at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 My conclusion on the interpretation of proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is buttressed by the following. Parties agreed that proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is the statutory embodiment of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Pym v Campbell </span>(1856) 6 E &amp; B 370 (“<span class="font-italic">Pym</span>”) in which the plaintiff produced at trial an agreement for sale of a machine signed by the defendant. The defendant gave evidence that the parties had negotiated the purchase and it had been arranged that they and a third person, one “Abernethie”, should meet. If Abernethie approved of the machine, they would make a bargain on these terms. Abernethie could not then be found. It was then proposed that, as the parties were all present and might find it troublesome to meet again, an agreement should be then drawn up and signed, which, if Abernethie approved of the machine, should be the agreement, but if Abernethie did not approve, should not be one. Abernethie did not approve of the invention when he saw it and the defendants contended that there was no bargain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In holding that the defendant’s evidence as such was admissible, Erle J reasoned (at 904–905):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The production of a paper purporting to be an agreement by a party, with his signature attached, affords a strong presumption that it is his written agreement; and, if in fact he did sign the paper animo contrahendi, the terms contained in it are conclusive, and cannot be varied by parol evidence: <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but in the present case the defence begins one step earlier</span><span class="font-italic">: the parties met and expressly stated to each other that, though for convenience they would then sign the memorandum of the terms, yet they were not to sign it as an agreement until Abernethie was consulted.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>I grant the risk that such a defence may be set up without ground; and I agree that a jury should therefore always look on such a defence with suspicion: but […] <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The distinction in point of law is that evidence to vary the terms of an agreement in writing is not admissible, but evidence to shew that there is not an agreement at all is admissible</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly, Lord Campbell CJ stated (at 905) that “[n]o addition to or variation from the terms of a written contract can be made by parol: <span class="font-italic">but in this case the defence was that there never was any agreement entered into</span>. Evidence to that effect is admissible; and the evidence given in this case was overwhelming” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Under the common law position, it therefore appeared that the prevalent view was to treat such an “exception” to the parol evidence rule (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to prove that parties did not intend their contract to take effect until some condition precedent was fulfilled) as, in reality, issues raised of general contractual validity and enforceability to which<span class="font-italic"> </span>the parol evidence rule has no application (see also, UK Law Commission, <span class="font-italic">Law of Contract: The Parol Evidence Rule </span>(Law Com No 154, January 1986) D W at paras 2.30–2.31). Insofar as proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to s 94 of the EA now statutorily embodies the rule in <span class="font-italic">Pym</span>, I am satisfied that the circumstances stipulated in proviso (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) are not intended to be read subject to the qualifying words “for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms” in the chapeau.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, I consider that Cradle Wealth could not rely on illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as being “on all fours” with the present case. Illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in fact addresses the situation of an oral collateral contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an independent contract from the written agreement) and, together with illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>), are examples of the application of s 94(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) pertains to the situation in which evidence is admissible of any oral agreement of a warranty, if the document is silent on this matter and the oral agreement is not inconsistent with its terms. Illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is the converse situation in which the evidence pertains to an oral agreement that is inconsistent with an express term of the written agreement. In the present case, the Defendants rely on s 94(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) which is clearly confined to evidence of a condition precedent to the written contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I am therefore satisfied that the extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced by the Defendants to prove the oral condition precedent would have been admissible, but for the entire agreement clause. However, for the following reasons, I find in any event that the facts do not disclose the oral condition precedent as pleaded by the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Do the facts disclose that the monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones was a condition precedent?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Ltd v Merriwa Nominees Pty Ltd </span>[2004] SGCA 44 the Court of Appeal affirmed (at [22]) that the words “condition precedent” in the context of contracts can be “used to describe a condition which does not prevent the existence of a binding contract, but which suspends performance of it until fulfilment of the condition”, citing Kim Lewison’s <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts </span>(3rd Ed, 2004) at para 15.02. The courts will be slow to construe an oral agreement as a condition precedent where “the written agreement [has] already become binding and [has] been performed” (<span class="font-italic">Wen Wen Food Trading </span>at [32]). Cradle Wealth had performed its part of the bargain under the Settlement Agreement by its discontinuance of Suit 940 on 2 March 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Owing to the significant factual overlap between the Defendants’ case premised on sham and their <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>case premised on condition precedent (see [28] above), and given that the Defendants in fact relied on <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">exact same </span>extrinsic material in seeking to prove the terms of the alleged Actual Agreement and the existence of the alleged condition precedent,

</div> I considered that much of my findings above at [34]–[70] after considering the totality of the evidence were equally applicable to the latter question of condition precedent. I therefore repeat my finding that whilst the topic of Nazarisham’s Alexandrite Gemstones was at the very least mentioned by the parties during the day of the mediation, and the parties anticipated working together to achieve a “comeback” for their respective businesses, such an expectation <span class="font-italic">never</span> extended to agreeing that the Alexandrite Gemstones must be successfully monetised before Cradle Wealth would become entitled to be paid the sum of US$4,000,000 under the Settlement Agreement.

</div> The Defendants assert that Sathish and Sylvester had during the private discussion at the Café on 28 February 2020 promised Nazarisham that the Settlement Agreement would not be enforced by Cradle Wealth until the Alexandrite Gemstones were successfully monetised by way of a collaborative effort between the Defendants, Sathish and Sylvester. Relying on this promise, Nazarisham signed the Settlement Agreement on 28 February 2020. The parties later abandoned all efforts to monetise the Alexandrite Gemstones and Cradle Wealth commenced Suit 781 to enforce the Settlement Agreement. Since then, the Alexandrite Gemstones have also come under a prohibition order issued by the Singapore Police Force such that Nazarisham is unable to access or deal with the gemstones. If Cradle Wealth is allowed to resile from its promise, the Defendants submit that they will suffer detriment because they cannot pay the sum of US$4,000,000 without the successful monetisation of the Alexandrite Gemstones. Under these circumstances, it would be inequitable for Cradle Wealth to resile from its promise.
