Part of the content of this broad obligation goes to anything that affects the continuation of the relationship, and thus may overlap or be related to constructive dismissal.

In <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>, the High Court unequivocally held that unless there are express terms to the contrary, or the context implies otherwise, an implied term of mutual trust and confidence is implied by law into a contract of employment under Singapore law (at [59]). This implied term includes a duty of fidelity, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a duty to act honestly and faithfully (at [55]), but is limited to the manner of treatment within the employment relationship (at [58]). Parties may exclude or modify the implied term to limit its content (at [59]). As for the breach of this implied term, an objective assessment must be undertaken (at [58]), and a cumulative series of acts taken together can result in a breach of this implied term (at [132]). The court in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock </span>then applied these general principles to its facts, eventually finding that there was a breach of this implied term. As this breach amounted to a repudiatory breach, the court found that there had been constructive dismissal and awarded damages to the employee accordingly. The breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence thus formed part of the ratio in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There was also recognition of this implied term in obiter by other High Court cases (see <span class="font-italic">Edward Wong</span> at [52]; <span class="font-italic">Brader Daniel John and others v Commerzbank AG</span> [2014] 2 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Brader Daniel John</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [110]–[113]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thereafter, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span> dealt with an application to strike out a claim for damages for constructive dismissal and alternatively, a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. In doing so, it analysed the types and extent of damages recoverable from a breach of the implied term. Notably, the court struck out the appellant’s claim on the basis that the extent of damages he was claiming was legally unsustainable (at [22]), and appeared to have proceeded on the assumption that the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence was part of Singapore law, though this was not explicitly stated: Ravi Chandran at para 4.435; Dennis Ong &amp; Steven Ang, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Employment Law</span> (Cengage Learning Asia Pte Ltd, 2017) at p 101.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Conclusion on the general principles applicable to the implied term of mutual trust and confidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 An examination of Singapore authorities on this issue demonstrated that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has been accepted into Singapore law as a term implied by law in employment contracts. While the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has a broad scope that covers anything that affects the continuation of the employment relationship, its contents may be excluded or modified by express terms in the employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is also clear that a breach of this implied term is independently actionable. The determination of whether there has been a breach involves an objective consideration of the impact of the employer’s act(s), either individually or cumulatively, on the employee. The issue, specifically, is whether that impact is of a nature that is likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence required for the employment relationship to function. In this analysis, proof of a subjective loss of confidence in the employer is not an essential element of the breach, and the employer’s intention and motives are not determinative or even relevant. Even if the employer’s conduct has such a severe impact on the relationship of trust and confidence, the employer will not be in breach of the implied term if that conduct is supported by a reasonable and proper cause. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on the implied term of mutual trust and confidence: suspensions and investigations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I accepted that under the current state of our law the implied term of mutual trust and confidence would extend to stigma and analogous situations to some extent, and would within bounds regulate the employer’s conduct in suspending and investigating employees. But I did not accept that the obligation extends to suspension of employees, the conduct of investigations, or inquiry in the broad manner advocated by the plaintiff’s counsel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Parties’ arguments on the law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff argued that this implied term has a broad scope which includes the duty “not to suspend an employee for disciplinary purposes without proper and reasonable cause” (<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [56]).

</div> but I set it out here nonetheless, as it did have some relevance as to what the content of the implied term ought to be.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Discussion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I did not accept that an employer’s obligations under the implied term of mutual trust and confidence are as narrowly defined as the defendants argue – this implied term does impose some obligations on the employer when it carries out investigations and suspensions. However, I did not conclude that the implied term is so broad as to import all the obligations contended for by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Guidance on the degree of obligations imposed, in so far as investigations and suspensions are concerned, can be sought from English and local case law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Two contrasting British cases, not cited by the parties, help illustrate the issue. On the issue of whether the employer had conducted investigations against an employee in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, the English court in <span class="font-italic">Hameed v Central Manc</span><span class="font-italic">hester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</span> [2010] EWHC 2009 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Hameed</span>”) found that the employer’s failure to formally inform one of the allegations against the employee did not render the investigation unfair since the employee was given, and took, every opportunity to respond to that allegation (at [234]–[236]). The court also rejected the employee’s complaint that it was unfair for the investigation team to refuse disclosure of all witness evidence that they have gathered, because the relevant matters had been put to her and she had the opportunity to deal with them (at [236]). The investigator’s omission to obtain evidence from a particular witness also did not cause unfairness to the employee, given that the investigator had considered that evidence from that witness would cause further delay without adding anything to the investigation (at [238]). There was thus no unfairness in the investigation process, and consequently, no breach of the implied term (at [228] and [240]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 <span class="font-italic">Hameed</span> can be contrasted with <span class="font-italic">McNeill v Aberdeen City Council</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span> [2014] IRLR 113 (“<span class="font-italic">McNeill</span>”), where the Inner House of the Scottish Court of Session upheld the Employment Tribunal’s decision that the manner in which the employer carried out investigations amounted to a breach of the <span class="font-italic">Malik</span> duty of mutual trust and confidence (at [5], [9] and [83]). On the facts, the <span class="font-italic">Malik</span> implied term was breached for a number of reasons, including having a partial investigator (at [45]), extending investigations to cover new complaints which were so vague and unsupported by evidence that the employee had no real opportunity of dealing with them (at [46] and [74]), and uncritically accepting statements from a witness who clearly had a strong motive for implicating the employee in question and allowing that same witness to dictate the course of the investigations (at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 While the Singapore High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> did not deal with a situation where an employer investigated complaints against an employee, it nonetheless stood for a proposition that has bearing on how investigations ought to be conducted. There, the founder and executive director of the company brought up problems with the employee’s organisational changes at a meeting in the absence of that employee, and without bringing these concerns to that employee’s attention (at [102]). In finding that this amounted to a breach of the implied term, the court held that “[a] relationship of mutual trust and confidence requires that the employer inform the employee of charges levelled against him, and give him the opportunity to rectify any problems or clarify any misunderstandings” (at [102]). This is sound in principle and should, I believe, apply equally in the context of investigating an employee where complaints about that employee have been raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Apart from unfairness in the investigation process, suspension of an employee for disciplinary purposes without proper and reasonable cause can amount to a breach of the implied term (<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [56(d)] citing <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span>, the court found that the suspension of an employee, by means of a letter stating that there had been allegations of sexual abuse made against the employee, breached the implied term. The severity of such an allegation clearly damaged the trust and confidence subsisting between the employer and employee (at [55]), and there was no proper cause for the employer to put that allegation to the employee since the source of the relevant information was a child who was so unclear in her communication that further inquiries should be made before the allegation can be characterised as one of sexual abuse (at [55]–[56]). It was also difficult to accept that there was no other useful work for the employee to undertake for the short time needed to make inquiries, or that a short period of leave was not contemplated (at [57]). On the whole, the employer’s immediate “knee-jerk” reaction in response to a supposed allegation of sexual abuse breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence (at [58]–[59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In contrast, <span class="font-italic">London Borough of Lambeth v Agoreyo </span>[2019] IRLR 560 (“<span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span>”) at [101]–[102] distinguished its facts from <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span>, and held that the suspension of the employee in its case did not constitute a breach of the implied term. In <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span>, the complaints which led the employee’s suspension were made by two members of staff, whilst in <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span>, the only source of the complaint of sexual abuse was a troubled child who was the victim of the alleged abuse and whose account was contradictory at times. Furthermore, the complaints against the employee in <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span>, were that she had used force to secure behavioural compliance from the children on three separate incidents involving two different children. In these circumstances, court held that the employer had reasonable and proper cause to suspend the employee pending investigations. While it is perhaps not meaningful to compare the gravity of the allegations made in <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span> and <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span>, what is clear is that the key factor distinguishing the facts in <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span> from <span class="font-italic">Gogay</span> was the credibility of the sources of the allegations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion on the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in respect of investigations and suspensions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 These cases show that there is, within that obligation of mutual trust and confidence, a minimum content of fairness required of the employer when suspending and investigating allegations levelled against an employee. The fairness, to my mind, would certainly entail that the procedures adopted and the manner of investigations not amount to a hatchet job, meaning that the outcome was preordained against the plaintiff (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">McNeill </span>at [45] and [47]), or be so unfair that it went to destroy the basis of any expected continuation of the relationship of employment. The allegations put to the employee must also be sufficiently clear such that he understands the case that is made against him and has an opportunity to clarify his position (<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [102]; <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">f</span> <span class="font-italic">McNeill</span> at [46] and [74]). As for suspension of employees, this ought to be carried out on the basis of clear credible source(s) of information. Suspending an employee precipitately as part of a “knee-jerk” reaction to an unclear or unspecific allegation with dubious credibility may fall below the minimum level of fairness required (see<span class="font-italic"> Gogay</span> at [55]–[59], contrasted with <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span> at [101]–[102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, this implied term does not import all the obligations of natural justice, or due process obligations, that may apply in other contexts, including informing of investigation outcome, or suspending and investigating allegations against employees in a particular way. I do not find that case authority supports any such import of broad obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 To the contrary, Lord Steyn in <span class="font-italic">Malik</span> at 46D observed that the implied term strikes a balance between an employer’s interest in managing his business as he sees fit and the employee’s interest in not being unfairly and improperly exploited. Some leeway should thus be given to the employer to act upon practical considerations in the process of investigating and suspending employees. In <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [102]), for instance, suspension of an employee even before a full investigation has been completed was not a breach of the implied term because the credibility of the sources of the allegations and the gravity of the allegations made warranted the taking of this precautionary measure. Similarly, the court in <span class="font-italic">Hameed </span>(at [238]) gave some latitude to the employer to omit interviewing a particular witness when that would cause further delay without adding much to the investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I would be wary of importing the broad obligations advocated for by the plaintiff into an employment contract as these obligations can be onerous if undefined, and unduly constrain the employer’s interest in managing her business as she sees fit. Legislation should be the primary mode of bringing in such broad obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there was breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I will first set out the employer’s conduct in question, before analysing whether they amounted to a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In his Statement of Claim and submissions, the plaintiff averred that the implied term of trust and confidence had been breached by the first defendant in many different ways,

</div> However, I could not interpret the second defendant’s email as expressly or impliedly requesting Mr Forsyth to redirect Ms Sumitra’s investigation. The second defendant was merely expressing his view, and some degree of frustration, on the direction in which investigations were proceeding. The recipient of this email was also not a person who was in any way in charge of the investigations. The second defendant’s involvement, in this respect, was not of an improper nature that tainted the fairness of the investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff then alleged that Mr Forsyth was influenced by the second defendant’s framing of the issue, as seen from Mr Forsyth’s email to Ms Sumitra on 24 October 2017 claiming that one of his real concerns was that the plaintiff was involved in a non-Shell ship.

</div> However, telling Ms Sumitra his view of what actually transpired ought not be regarded as improper given that she was in the midst of a fact-finding process. At most, the second defendant was being proactive and not much objection could be taken with that. In fact, the second defendant’s inputs could be useful because he was alerted to the incident by the plaintiff himself, and he thereafter reached out to Vitol for further information on 12 October 2017. In any event, BID did not blindly pursue the line of inquiry raised by the second defendant’s hypothesis. During cross-examination, Ms Sumitra reiterated that she did not see a need to ask the plaintiff about the second defendant’s hypothesis because there was insufficient evidence to back it up.

This reasoning was sound and logical.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As between “unsubstantiated” and “inconclusive”, Ms Sumitra explained that the key reason for concluding that it was “inconclusive”, was that the plaintiff took a huge risk to contact Mr Balota against proper communication channels just to obtain cargo information: this was inexplicable and illogical to some extent, as it was so strongly against market conventions and norms.

</div> Implicit in Ms Sumitra’s testimony and the BID Report, was that the plaintiff’s inexplicable behaviour raised doubts as to whether his motive for contacting Mr Balota was really just to obtain cargo information, or whether he contacted Mr Balota for other purposes, such as but not limited to marketing a third-party vessel. Understandably, these doubts were insufficient to support a conclusion of “substantiated” but neither could they be dismissed, hence the finding of inconclusiveness.

As evident from the extract above, the plaintiff mounted three key points in response. First, he was of the view that there was no rule that he could not talk to Mr Balota, the oil trader, because people in the industry “need to talk to each other to find out what’s going on”. This dealt with Mr Forsyth’s and Mr Choi’s view that there were conventional lines of communication within this industry. Second, the plaintiff explained that he contacted Mr Balota instead because he had a relationship with Mr Balota but not with Mr Jones. The last reason was that he wanted to find out information from Mr Balota directly since Mr Balota traded the Cargo the plaintiff was interested in.

This was already achieved, in substance, during the plaintiff’s interview on 23 October 2017, such that there was no need for BID to conduct another interview with the plaintiff to clarify the apparent illogicality of his actions in view of market conventions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In so far as the plaintiff’s complaint pertained to the lack of opportunity to respond to BID’s assessment that it was unusual for him to go against market norms just to obtain information on a cargo, the tasks of weighing the plaintiff’s alleged motives for contacting Mr Balota against the force of market convention, and determining whether the former sufficiently explained acting against market norms, were a matter of value judgment which the BID was entitled to undertake independently without the plaintiff’s input. Certainly, BID had to gather evidence, and in so far as the BID was conducting a fact-finding exercise, the plaintiff’s position and account of what transpired had to be heard. In this regard, I accepted that the plaintiff had been given ample opportunity to put forward his position, via an interview on 23 October 2017 and multiple SMS messages to Ms Sumitra on 27 October and 31 October 2017. But upon the conclusion of its fact-finding exercise, BID could not be faulted for independently reviewing the evidence and making its own judgment calls.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As for the second issue of the first defendant not particularising the factual allegations against the plaintiff in writing,

</div> I found that this did not fall below the minimum standard of fairness required by the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. In so far as the allegation of marketing a third-party vessel was concerned, Ms Sumitra had verbally asked the plaintiff to describe his conversation with Mr Balota, and explain his motives for contacting Mr Balota. The plaintiff responded by relaying his version of what had transpired, and clarified his motives.

</div> Hence, even though the allegations were not formally put to the plaintiff, the questions asked by Ms Sumitra during the interview were clear and direct, such that the plaintiff had a fair chance to put forward his version of events and make clarifications. The circumstances of this case resemble the situation in <span class="font-italic">Hameed</span>, where the letter to the employee did not specify the allegation, but no unfairness was caused since the employee was given, and took, every opportunity to respond to that allegation (at [234]–[236]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On the third issue of whether the plaintiff’s ability to respond to the allegations was hampered by his suspension, I found that, even though the plaintiff’s access to emails was blocked, BID did diligently comb through the plaintiff’s ESI.

</div> The implied term of mutual trust and confidence does not go so far as to stipulate the specific ways in which companies ought to conduct their internal investigations.

On this issue, the defendants argued that it was not necessary to do so since the employment relationship was nearing its end and revealing the outcome would serve no purpose other than to assuage the plaintiff, which is not the function of the employment contract.

</div> The allegations made against the plaintiff in relation to the Vitol incident in 2017 raised the concern of a conflict of interest again. Hence, the plaintiff’s repeated behaviour of placing himself in seemingly compromising positions made it reasonable for the first defendant to pre-emptively protect itself from any further reputational damage by suspending the plaintiff while investigations were carried out. Moreover, the decision to suspend was not a “knee-jerk” reaction to an unspecific allegation with dubious credibility. Rather, it was predicated on the second defendant’s email, which contained clear and specific allegations, which were said to originate from Vitol’s chartering manager (see above at [9]). This, on its face, lends some credibility to the allegations made since it was Vitol’s chartering manager with whom the plaintiff had a run-in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 An analogy can be drawn to the case of <span class="font-italic">Agoreyo</span>, where the suspension of an employee even before a full investigation has been completed was found not to be a breach of the implied term. There, the credibility of the sources of the allegations and the gravity of the allegations made warranted the taking of this precautionary measure. Similarly, in view of the gravity of the situation and credibility of the sources of information, the first defendant did not breach the implied term of mutual trust and confidence when it decided to suspend the plaintiff while conducting investigations in the meantime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Finally, there was a proper explanation for the plaintiff’s continued suspension even after the investigation had concluded: the first defendant was deliberating on whether the plaintiff’s employment ought to be continued, and was arranging for a meeting to convey their decision to terminate. On 17 December 2017, Mr Kokkinis sent an email setting out the events relating to the plaintiff over the past two to three years, concluding that “it [was] impossible to accept [the plaintiff] back on the desk”.

</div> also observed<span class="font-italic"> </span>that case law had refrained from imposing a duty of care on employers to protect the economic or reputational interests of employees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 One of the cases cited in <span class="font-italic">James-Bowen </span>was <span class="font-italic">Crossley v Faithful &amp; Gould Holdings Ltd</span> [2004] 4 All ER 447 (“<span class="font-italic">Crossley</span>”), where the court<span class="font-italic"> </span>refused to imply a term into an employment contract that the employer will take reasonable care for the economic well-being of his employee (at [33]) because such an implied term would impose an “unfair and unreasonable burden on employers” (at [43]). A reason raised by the court was that the content of a general duty to take reasonable care for the economic well-being of an employee is unclear, and it is not obvious what an employer is required to do or refrain from doing in order to discharge this duty (at [45]). This reason applies with equal force to refuse finding a duty to safeguard an employee’s reputational interests. Such broad obligations can be onerous if undefined, and it is for legislation to import such broad obligations into an employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 More fundamentally, the court in <span class="font-italic">Crossley</span> observed that it is simply not part of the bargain comprised in the employment contract that an employer had to function as his employee’s financial adviser (at [44]). Similarly, it can be said that the employment contract does not envisage the employer as a protector of its employee’s reputation, including his professional reputation. The purpose of the trust and confidence implied term is to facilitate the proper functioning of the employment contract by preserving the employment relationship (<span class="font-italic">Malik</span> at 36E and 37H per Lord Nicholls), and the employment relationship can still function even if an employee does not have the best professional reputation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 A narrower duty to combat misinformation is similarly not part of the bargain under the employment contract – the employer-employee relationship can still work even with untrue rumours about an employee circulating in the market. An employer could be in a better position than his employee to dispel such untruths, but the same could be said for many things, such as the supply of employment references or caring for an employee’s financial well-being. To impose a duty on the basis that an employer is in a better position to do so than his employee would open the floodgates. Any additional duties must be imposed on a principled basis. In balancing an employer’s and employee’s interests as described by Lord Steyn in <span class="font-italic">Malik </span>at 46D, an employer should be allowed to focus on managing its business proper without being saddled with the burdensome task of correcting market rumours about its employees. An employee, in any case, cannot be said to be unfairly treated by his employer for failing to correct market rumours and misinformation, especially when such rumours and misinformation do not originate from the employer. There is thus no principled reason for obliging an employer to dispel false rumours concerning an employee even if they had a bearing on the employee’s professional reputation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It follows, from the foregoing analysis, that an employer ought not be obligated to dispel misinformation pertaining to his employee, nor does he have to take reasonable care to protect his employees from economic and reputational harm.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Even if there was such duty, there was no breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Even assuming that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence requires the first defendant to dispel misinformation pertaining to the employee, or take reasonable care to protect employees from economic and reputational harm, there was no breach of this implied term on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiff speculated that Mr Kokkinis did not point out the falsity of the allegations in the Platts Query and Platts Article because he wanted to have the plaintiff’s employment terminated.

</div>
</div> This was a decision that they were entitled to make and must modify any implied obligation including that of mutual trust and confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In this regard, the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> provides useful guidance as to how this implied term of mutual trust and confidence should interact with express provisions in the employment contract. The court must ensure mutual compatibility amongst the terms in a contract (<span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [82]); where inconsistencies between the express terms and implied term of mutual trust and confidence arise, the content of the latter must be modified by the former since the implied term merely operates as a default rule: <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [59]. In particular, express termination provisions can vary the content of the implied term: <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [60] and [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Consistent with the primacy accorded to express terms, the court must ensure that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence does not operate in manner that undermines the express bargain agreed to by the parties. By way of illustration, in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>, this implied term governed the manner in which the employer exercised its discretion to appoint a joint-CEO under an express clause, such that the joint-CEO’s appointment must not make the plaintiff’s CEO position redundant. The court held that this limitation imposed by the implied term did not undermine the full effect of the express clause, because in the first place, that clause did not provide for an absolute and unqualified right for the employer to replace the plaintiff in all his functions as CEO. Such an interpretation was not supported by the literal meaning of “joint” in “joint-CEO” and would be incompatible with other express clauses: <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [79]–[82]. Subsequently, the court also<span class="font-italic"> </span>held that the employer’s power to reverse the plaintiff’s changes to the company, was subjected to the implied term of mutual trust and confidence which limited the manner in which any overriding of changes might be done. This again, was compatible with the full effect of the express terms of the contract, because the operation of the implied term in this manner was reinforced by another express clause which provided that the employer’s power to reverse these changes should be exercised properly and reasonably: <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span> at [123].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Turning to the facts of this case, the termination provision in the plaintiff’s employment contract stated that the first defendant has the right to terminate the plaintiff’s employment by giving the plaintiff three months’ notice in writing. The plain wording of that clause and other parts of the contract did not place any fetter on the first defendant’s discretion to terminate once three months’ notice in writing is given. Hence, the bargain expressly provided for in the employment contract was that the first defendant had the full discretion to terminate the plaintiff’s employment once the plaintiff was given three months’ notice in writing. This would be undermined by an implied term that obliged the employer not to damage the relationship of trust and confidence without “proper and reasonable cause”, as that would effectively require termination to be on the basis of “proper and reasonable cause”, in addition to the three months’ notice period. To ensure compatibility between the express and implied terms of the employment contract, this express termination provision must thus modify the content of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, such that this implied term did not apply where this express termination provision was relied upon to end the employment relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As a result, the plaintiff in this case could not rely on a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, since the first defendant had invoked the express termination provision in the employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Before leaving this point, I make two observations. First, English authorities do not speak in unison on how the implied term of mutual trust and confidence ought to interact with express terms in an employment contract. Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Unisys Ltd </span>[2003] 1 AC 518 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37] held that this implied term cannot override what parties have expressly agreed. This accords with the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock</span>. However, in a dissenting judgment, Lord Steyn in <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [24] held that this implied term of mutual trust and confidence is an “overarching obligation implied by law”, that requires at least express words or a necessary implication to displace it or to cut down its scope. Reliance was placed on <span class="font-italic">Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd</span> [1991] 1 WLR 589 and <span class="font-italic">United Bank Ltd v Akhtar </span>[1989] IRLR 507 (“<span class="font-italic">Akhtar</span>”) for the propositions that the employer’s express contractual rights are subject to the implied obligation that they should not be exercised so as to destroy the relationship of trust and confidence, and that the employer’s express rights may be qualified by this implied obligation. <span class="font-italic">Stevens v University of Birmingham</span> [2016] 4 All ER 258 at [88] also interpreted <span class="font-italic">Akhtar </span>as standing for the proposition that that the overriding obligation of trust and confidence may qualify behaviour which might otherwise appear to be justified because it falls within the literal interpretation of those express terms. This line of authority raises the question of whether the employer’s exercise of its express right to terminate ought to be qualified by an “overriding obligation of trust and confidence”, even where a literal interpretation of the express provisions gives employers the full discretion to terminate save for the issuance of notices. This issue was not raised in the course of submissions, and I leave this point to be decided in another case. It sufficed to state, at this juncture, that it is doubtful whether this line of authority is sound in principle. Principles of contract law apply to employment contracts as well (<span class="font-italic">Piattchanine, Iouri v Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1257 at [115]), and it is trite that an implied term cannot contradict an express term of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart </span>[2012] 4 SLR 308 at [60]). Making the implied term of mutual trust and confidence an “overriding obligation” such that it could cut back on the full effect of the contractual right expressly provided for, does not sit well with this trite principle in contract law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Secondly, if there had been no express termination provision in the plaintiff’s employment contract, this court might have to confront the issue of whether the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>ought to apply in Singapore. By a majority decision, the House of Lords held that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence does not apply to the manner of dismissal, mainly because an implied term that covers the manner of dismissal will overlap, and even be inconsistent, with the statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c 18) (UK) (<span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [2] per Lord Nicholls, at [58] per Lord Hoffmann and at [80] per Lord Millett). It remained an open question as to whether <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> ought to apply in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Miu Yin v Philip Morris Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2011] SGHC 161 at [44]–[45]; <span class="font-italic">Cheah Peng Hock </span>at [61]; <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span> at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Conclusion on whether there was a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Summing up my findings thus far, the facts did not reveal any misconduct in the investigation process as alleged by the plaintiff and even though the plaintiff was suspended and the investigation outcome was not disclosed to him, these were for proper and reasonable causes. The implied term of mutual trust and confidence does not extend so far as to place an obligation on the first defendant to combat misinformation about its employee, or take reasonable care to protect employees from economic and reputational harm, and neither did this implied term apply to the termination of the plaintiff’s employment on the facts of this case. Hence, I found that the first defendant had not breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence contained within the plaintiff’s employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy with the second defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The plaintiff’s case for conspiracy was that the second defendant, along with Mr Kokkinis and other members of the first defendant, had conspired to conceal the investigation outcome from the plaintiff, procure his continued suspension, and concoct various reasons to justify the plaintiff’s dismissal.

That said, the question before the court at all times remains whether the defendant was negligent on the balance of probabilities. For this rule to apply, the plaintiff must prove that the explanation resting on the defendant’s negligence is that which is more probable than not, before the evidential burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of negligence (<span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical </span>at [40] and [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 It follows that <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> can only be used as a presumption to ascribe an incident to the defendant’s negligence where no other equally, or more probable competing cause could exist. That is a far cry from the situation here, where other sources outside the first defendant were readily apparent and which could not be excluded at all. In particular, as Mr Jones and Mr Balota from Vitol did not testify at trial, it could not be ruled out that they did not share the existence and details of the investigation to others, including Platts. After all, they were the ones who had the run-in with the plaintiff and were interviewed by the first defendant’s BID team. They would thus be privy to the existence and some details of the investigation, as well as allegations against the plaintiff. Furthermore, Platts confirmed, in their answers to interrogatories, that it was not the first defendant who had provided it information.

</div> Platts’ answers did not point to Vitol as being the source of its information, but it did strengthen the probability that Platts’ sources lay outside the first defendant.

</div> this third allegation was not found in the plaintiff’s pleadings. Hence, I disregarded this third allegedly false statement in my findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As for whether the second defendant had committed the tort of malicious falsehood in relation to the First and Second Allegations, it must be borne in mind that even if the second defendant’s version of what transpired might have been different from what appears to have been uncovered by the investigation, this did not necessarily show that the second defendant committed any wrong as pleaded. The first element requires the plaintiff to prove that the second defendant was not told of the First and Second Allegations, and this turned on what Mr Jones had conveyed to the second defendant prior to the 12 October Email, not the outcome of BID investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Parties, however, primarily relied on what Mr Jones told BID during his interview,

</div> to ascertain whether the second defendant was told of the First and Second Allegations prior to the 12 October Email. This was unsatisfactory. Firstly, what Mr Jones told BID during his interview might have been different from what Mr Jones informed the second defendant prior to the 12 October Email. As Mr Jones was not called as a witness, it could not be safely said that Mr Jones had no motive to change his account between the time he relayed the information to the second defendant and his interview with BID. It would be a matter of speculation as to whether he had such a motive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Secondly, even if BID had attempted to summarise its interview with Mr Jones as accurately as possible in its report, its summary would inevitably be coloured by BID’s own interpretation of what Mr Jones said during the interview. Again, Mr Jones was not called as a witness to testify that BID’s summary was a fully accurate representation of what he had conveyed to BID, or whether BID’s summary had fully captured certain nuances which he attempted to convey during the interview.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In these circumstances, little weight ought to be placed on BID’s summary as it had little probative value in determining what Mr Jones told the second defendant prior to the 12 October Email. As Mr Jones was not called as a witness by either party, there was no direct evidence of whether Mr Jones had, or had not, told the second defendant about the First and Second Allegations. There was thus inadequate evidence proving what Mr Jones had told the second defendant prior to the 12 October Email. The first element of falsity was not made out, and consequently, the tort of malicious falsehood was not established against the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The question of damages would be touched on briefly. I did not find that the plaintiff had made out his case as to the measure of damages sought, and preferred the evidence of the defendants’ witness, Ms Stine Martinussen (“Ms Martinussen”). In particular, the measure of damages ought to be reduced to the extent that the plaintiff failed to undertake reasonable efforts to seek alternative employment in the industry. After his dismissal, he only contacted four companies in the shipping industry when there were at least 10 to 15 jobs in freight trading or chartering that were posted on LinkedIn in the year of 2018.

The right not to be treated arbitrarily or capriciously by an employer is also conceptually different from the implied term of mutual trust and confidence: the former concerns the employer’s reasons (or lack thereof) in acting in a certain manner, while the latter looks at the effect of the employer’s conduct on the trust and confidence underpinning the employer-employee relationship.
