In light of this, Kok Hong secured an extension till 8pm hoping to finish this item on the agenda. Kok Hong announced to the meeting, somewhat over-optimistically that: “We have been able to get an extension of one more hour to stay here, so it looks like we will be able to go through the elections and counting of the votes, okay?”.

This issue turned on the statutory interpretation of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Act. This provision had two disjunctive limbs. Management council members had to vacate their offices either: (a) at the end of the AGM following the one at which they were elected, or (b) immediately upon election of a replacement member at a <span class="font-italic">general meeting</span>. Chan made submissions on both limbs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Chan’s first argument was really an extension of her arguments in relation to the Mandatory Motion and Residual Power Issues. If the court grants the Adjournment Declaration, the AGM would be deemed to have concluded on 3 August 2019. It follows that the council members would have been obliged to step down on 3 August 2019, pursuant to the first limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Act.

</div> The draftsmen could not have intended for such an absurd result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Having set out the parties’ positions, I now turn to my decision on the issues identified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: The Residual Power Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 At common law, an adjournment of a meeting may be brought about by a resolution of the meeting or by the action of the chairperson: Madeline Cordes &amp; John Pugh-Smith, <span class="font-italic">Shackleton on the Law and Practice of Meetings </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2014) at 6-15 (“<span class="font-italic">Shackleton”</span>). The starting point is that, where the will of the meeting demands it, the meeting can be adjourned for any reason. This mandate can either be expressed in the form of a motion, or through informal but unanimous assent of the attendees: <span class="font-italic">Si-Hoe </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Hong Chun and another v Ramesh Ramchandani </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 59 at [20] and [22] which stands for the proposition that generally, in meetings of the management corporation, unanimous and informal assent to some matter within the purview of a general meeting is as valid as a motion properly passed. Beyond this, the common law also empowers the chairperson to adjourn of his own volition under certain circumstances: see <span class="font-italic">Byng v London Life Association Ltd </span>[1990] Ch 170 at 188D (<span class="font-italic">“Byng”</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Byng</span>, the defendant company held an extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of amending its memorandum of association. The company initially estimated the size of the turnout to be less than 300 and booked Cinema 1 at the Barbican Centre which could accommodate that number. As the meeting approached, the company was concerned that it would not be adequate and booked two overflow rooms and the foyer at the Barbican Centre, with space for an additional 200 or more, to accommodate those who could not fit into Cinema 1. Arrangement was made for a video-link between the four venues. But the organisers of the meeting feared this would still not have been enough and booked another room at the Café Royal from 1.30pm to 5pm. The room there could take 800 people.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 On the day of the meeting, the organisers’ fears were realised and an unprecedented number of attendees showed up. Although the meeting was fixed for 12pm, registration could not be completed in time. The chairman, Dawson, announced that the start of the meeting would be delayed by 20 minutes. He later delayed it by another 10 minutes, to 12.30pm. But due to the poor arrangements for registration, it was still not completed by then. When Dawson called the meeting to order at 12.30pm, a member rose to object that it was not fair to start the meeting when there were people outside still trying to get into the meeting. One member proposed to take a vote on an adjournment but others voiced opposition to it. Dawson pointed out that such a vote would take a considerable time and the member withdrew the proposal. Then the following events took place [at p 181A]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The time was now about 12.45 or 12.50. One of the doors of the cinema was forced open letting in a “muted roar” from the foyer. At that stage Mr. Dawson said that he proposed the adjournment of the meeting himself and proposed that it should adjourn to alternative accommodation at the Café Royal where the meeting would resume at 2.30 p.m. A policy holder objected that he had appointments for the afternoon and received support from the body of those in the cinema. The chairman repeated that he proposed the adjournment to the Café Royal but said that he would like it to be done with the majority consent of the members. Another policy holder suggested that such an adjournment of the meeting would be invalid (which again received support) and pointed out that the meeting could not continue if part of the membership was excluded. Another policy holder said words to the effect that such an adjournment would exclude those who could not attend at 2.30 and that such an adjournment would prejudice those who had appeared at the right time and in the right place. This again received support from the floor. Another policy holder then proposed a vote of no confidence in the board. The chairman then adjourned the meeting to the Café Royal at 2.30.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The meeting resumed at 2.30pm at the Café Royal and the resolution was passed. One of the issues for the English Court of Appeal was whether the meeting was validly adjourned by Dawson. The court held that although at common law a chairperson had no <span class="font-italic">general</span> power to adjourn a meeting of his own will, there were <span class="font-italic">certain</span> circumstances in which he had the power to adjourn. Hence, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C at p.186B, “it is clearly established that a chairman has such power where unruly conduct prevents the continuation of business: <span class="font-italic">John v Rees</span> [1970] Ch 345, 379 et seq” and [at p 186C] “when in an orderly meeting a poll is demanded on a motion to adjourn and such poll cannot be taken forthwith, the chairman has power to suspend the meeting with a view to its continuance at a later date after the result of the poll is known: <span class="font-italic">Jackson v Hamlyn </span>[1953] Ch. 577”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Vice-Chancellor also considered that the chairperson of a meeting has a responsibility to preserve order in a meeting for the meeting to achieve its purpose. Hence at p 186E, he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment the position at common law is correctly set out in <span class="font-italic">John</span><span class="font-italic"> v. Rees</span> [1970] Ch. 345 and in the two following passages. The first quoted, at p. 380, is from <span class="font-italic">Reg.</span><span class="font-italic"> v. D'Oyly</span> (1840) 12 Ad. &amp; El. 139, 159:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“Setting aside the inconvenience that might arise if a majority of the parishioners could determine the point of adjournment, we think that the person who presides at the meeting is the proper individual to decide this. It is on him that it devolves, both to preserve order in the meeting, and to regulate the proceedings <span class="font-italic">so as to</span><span class="font-italic"> give all persons entitled a reasonable opportunity of voting</span>. He is to do the acts <span class="font-italic">necessary for these purposes</span> on his own responsibility, and subject to being called upon to answer for his conduct if he has done anything improperly.” [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second passage quoted, at p. 381, is from <span class="font-italic">A Practical Arrangement of Ecclesiastical Law</span> by F. N. Rogers Q.C. published in 1840. The passage says that [the decision in <span class="font-italic">Stoughton v. Reynolds, </span>2 Str 1045; Fort. 168, which stood for the proposition that a chairperson cannot disrupt a meeting while it is in orderly progress]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“by no means interferes with the right which every chairman has to make a bona fide adjournment, whilst a poll or other business is proceeding, if circumstances of violent interruption make it unsafe, or seriously difficult for the voters to tender their votes; nor of adjourning the place of polling, if the ordinary place used for that purpose be insufficient or greatly inconvenient. In most of such cases, the question will turn upon the intention and effect of the adjournment, if the intention and effect were to interrupt and procrastinate the business, such an adjournment would be illegal; if on the contrary, the intention and effect were to forward or facilitate it, <span class="font-italic">and no injurious effect were produced</span>, such an adjournment would, it is conceived, be generally supported” [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Vice-Chancellor was of the view that the chairperson [at p 187B]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">would at common law have had power to adjourn the meeting at the cinema since the inadequacy of the space available rendered it impossible for all those entitled to attend to take part in the debate and to vote. A motion for adjournment could not be put to the meeting as many who would be entitled to vote on the motion were excluded. Therefore, at common law it would have been the chairman's duty to regulate the proceedings so as to give all persons entitled a reasonable opportunity of debating and voting. This would have required him either to abandon the meeting or to adjourn it to a time and a place where the members could have a reasonable opportunity to debate or vote. I see no reason to hold that in all circumstances the meeting must be abandoned: in my judgment the chairman can, in a suitable case, merely adjourn such meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having established the chairperson’s residual power in common law to adjourn meetings, the question turns to whether Lee had properly exercised this power.

</div> It goes without saying that a meeting that extended past 9pm, even if it had been at all possible, could not have accommodated those who had entirely ordinary expectations of when the meeting was supposed to conclude. Their opportunities to vote and speak would have been prejudiced. This is exacerbated by the fact that there was an unforeseen tie for the 11th seat. In short, the meeting had gone on two hours beyond the scheduled time, some people had left, others were anxious to leave, it was not possible to finish the remaining items in the agenda that night and there was a threat that the lights would be cut off. It is in this context that we must consider whether Lee’s adjournment of the meeting was valid. The words of Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in <span class="font-italic">Byng</span> [at p.188A] are instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the judge pointed out, the contrary result would produce manifest absurdities. Say that there was a disturbance in a meeting which precluded the taking of any vote on a motion to adjourn. Would this mean that the meeting had to be abandoned even though a short adjournment would have enabled peace to be restored and the meeting resumed? Again, say that in the present case the adjoining Barbican theatre had been available on 19 October so that a short adjournment to the theatre would have enabled an effective meeting of all members wishing to attend to be held that morning. Can it really be the law that because a valid resolution for such an adjournment could not be passed in the cinema (many members entitled to vote being excluded from the cinema) no such adjournment could take place?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As chairman, Lee had the responsibility of ensuring that the meeting gave adequate opportunity to the attendees to consider the resolutions to be voted upon, including adequate opportunity to share their opinions on each matter, so that the resolutions truly reflect the will of the meeting. At the same time, she had the responsibility of ensuring the safety of the attendees and to ensure that the defendant did not breach its obligations to the venue operator. In the circumstances of the case, it is clear that the meeting would not have been able to complete all the agenda items and would have to be adjourned. If a resolution to adjourn had been put up, it would have taken some time for it to be put to a vote. And even if the meeting had voted against an adjournment, the meeting would have to stop at that point. Under these circumstances, if Lee had acted <span class="font-italic">in good faith</span> to adjourn the meeting, it was well within her powers as chairman under common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 A key requirement to the exercise of this power is that it be made in good faith, expressed in <span class="font-italic">Byng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as “the right which every chairman has to make a bona fide adjournment”: see [35] above. It goes without saying that if Lee had adjourned the meeting with an ulterior motive, the adjournment could be invalidated. However Chan did not allege this and indeed there is nothing on the evidence before me to suggest that this was the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At best, Chan’s contention was that chairpersons cannot rely on a power arising from an exigency of their own making. 
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-bd3454c5-c226-47df-a05d-eef419ca0f35" data-toggle="modal" type="button">71</button></sup>

</div>  Certainly, if the exigency had been manufactured by the chairman for the purpose of engineering circumstances that would justify an adjournment, then it could be evidence of bad faith. However, the facts of the present matter simply do not bear out this allegation. It seemed to me that Chan’s contention was simply that Lee had been negligent in allowing the meeting to go way beyond schedule. Lee may have been an inept chairman, but that is far from bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the other hand, it may well be argued that if Lee had held an iron grip on the meeting in view of the large number of items on the agenda to go through, there could well have been complaints that she did not conduct the meeting fairly. Indeed, there were spirited discussions about the audited accounts and the proposed annual budget of the MCST. These items (just two out of the 33 sub-motions on the agenda)

</div> There were also numerous hiccups that were not on the agenda to begin with (see [10] – [11] above). None of this could have been foreseen. If anything, Lee and Savills (the management agent) had tried their best to anticipate how long the AGM would take. The 2015 AGM had 27 sub-items on the agenda but “still managed to end at 6:35pm”.

</div> They therefore took the view that a meeting which started at about the same time (2pm) would have ended no later than 7pm. This was not an unreasonable assumption to make.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 There being no evidence of bad faith, I find that in the circumstances set out above, Lee had validly exercised her power under common law as chairman to adjourn the meeting on 3 August 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The Mandatory Motion Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Paragraph 3A of the First Schedule to the Act (“para 3A”) pertains to adjournments of general meetings. It reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Adjournment of general meetings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3A.</span>—(1) A general meeting of a management corporation or a subsidiary management corporation may be adjourned for any reason if a motion to adjourn the meeting is passed at the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The person presiding at a general meeting adjourned under sub-paragraph (1) must fix the time and place the general meeting adjourned is to be resumed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The secretary of the management corporation … must give notice of the time and place fixed under sub-paragraph (2) at least 14 days before the time fixed for the resumed meeting, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) by displaying the notice on the notice board of the management corporation …;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by serving the notice on every subsidiary proprietor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Paragraph 3A(1) of the First Schedule simply provides that a general meeting may be adjourned “for any reason” whatsoever if it is passed by motion at a general meeting of a management corporation. This provision is descriptive, not prescriptive. It empowers the meeting, upon a vote on a motion to adjourn, to adjourn a general meeting. Once the motion is carried, para 3A(2) requires the person chairing the meeting to fix a time and place for the adjourned meeting. Paragraph 3A(3) requires the secretary of the management corporation to give notice at least 14 days in advance of the adjourned meeting in the manner prescribed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There is nothing in the language of para 3A that displaces the residual common law power described in the preceding section. This is unlike the exclusionary language used in neighbouring provisions, for example, para 3(1) of the First Schedule, which states that “No business <span class="font-italic">shall </span>be transacted at any general meeting … unless a quorum of subsidiary proprietors is present” (emphasis added). And para 5(1) of the First Schedule states that “A vote at a general meeting … by a person entitled to vote or by a proxy <span class="font-italic">mu</span><span class="font-italic">st </span>be cast in person” (emphasis added). Paragraph 3A(1) of the First Schedule does not contain the same mandatory flavour of its adjacent provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Byng</span>, Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C examined whether art 18 of the articles of association of the company (“Article 18”) restricted this common law power. Article 18 provides that the chairperson “may, with the consent of any meeting … (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place …”. He held that it did not, stating as follows [at p.187G]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In my judgment article 18 regulates the chairman’s powers of adjournment to the extent that its machinery is effective to cover the contingencies which occur. Therefore if the circumstances are such that it is possible to discover whether or not the meeting agrees to an adjournment, article 18 lays down a comprehensive code. But if the circumstances are such that the wishes of the meeting cannot be validly ascertained, why should article 18 be read as impairing the fundamental common law duty of the chairman to regulate proceedings so as to enable those entitled to be present and to vote to be heard and to vote? In my judgment <span class="font-italic">Jackson v. Hamlyn</span> [1953] Ch. 577 is an authority in support of that view since in that case there was an article in much the same terms as article 18 in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Indeed there is much sense in preserving the residual common law power of the chairman as there may be circumstances, as occurred in the present case, in which such powers are needed and if sensibly exercised, there is no reason for the court to invalidate it. Accordingly, I find that the residual common law power of the chairperson to adjourn the AGM is not excluded by Para 3A.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The Election Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This issue went towards determining whether those persons who were elected to the 13th Management Council at the AGM had taken office on that day <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>3 August 2019. Chan took the view that these council elects had assumed office on 3 August 2019. The analysis ultimately turned on the interpretation of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Act (“section 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">54.</span>—(1) A person who is the chairperson, secretary or treasurer or a member of a council shall vacate his office as such a member —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) at the end of the next annual general meeting of the management corporation or upon the election at a general meeting of another person to that office, if earlier;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 This provision provides that management council members had to vacate their offices either: (a) at the end of the AGM following the one at which they were elected, or (b) immediately upon election of a replacement member at a general meeting. Flowing from my decision in Issues 1 and 2 (see [31] and [44]), it follows that the AGM was validly adjourned on 3 August 2019 and concluded at the adjourned meeting on 19 October that same year. Therefore, the arguments which Chan mounted on the first limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) fall away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Consequently, I do not have to address Lee’s counterargument, namely that even if the adjournment had been invalid, the AGM would not have concluded on 3 August 2019. As mentioned earlier at [27], the precise effects of an invalid adjournment are unclear at law. As this finding is rendered unnecessary by my decision on the Residual Power and Mandatory Motion Issues, it is perhaps better to leave this issue to a more appropriate case. I would only note that there is some force in the defendant’s observations that Lee’s interpretation would empty valid adjournments of all meaning. Her interpretation would mean that there is no difference whether a meeting was validly adjourned or not – the meeting would simply resume at a later date.

</div> That being said, there is also some authority for the proposition that an invalid adjournment need not have the effect of concluding a meeting: <span class="font-italic">Jackson and others v Hamlyn and others</span> [1953] 2 WLR 709 at 716.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The question then turns to whether a council member is obliged to vacate office immediately upon election of a replacement member at an annual general meeting. The second limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is unclear. It only provides that a council member need do so upon election of a replacement at a <span class="font-italic">general meeting</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I find that “general meeting” in the second limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) refers exclusively to <span class="font-italic">extraordinary </span>general meetings and not annual general meetings. Accordingly, a council member is not obliged to vacate office immediately upon election of a replacement at an <span class="font-italic">annual</span> general meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To my mind the most convincing reason is that the alternative interpretation (namely, that “general meeting” includes an <span class="font-italic">annual </span>general meeting) would render the first limb otiose. The first limb covers elections at an annual general meeting. Under this limb, the outgoing council members only step down at the <span class="font-italic">end</span> of the annual general meeting. If they were to step down immediately upon election of a new council (which could conceivably happen midway through an annual general meeting), it would be internally inconsistent with the first limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 To this, Chan’s argument was that the two limbs were reconcilable – the first limb merely provided a long-stop date by which a council member had to vacate office while the second limb obliged the council member to step down upon an earlier election.

</div> I am not persuaded by this argument. If the council members were to step down immediately upon election of a new council, there would be serious confusion at the meeting. There would be no chairperson to chair the rest of the AGM since the existing chairperson would have had to relinquish his/her post immediately after the elections. The incoming management council could not have supplied a replacement chairperson either – the meeting would not have had the opportunity as yet, to elect a chairperson or to empower the incoming management council to appoint one pursuant to s 55 (2) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I reject Chan’s other arguments as well. Chan suggested that the second limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) references an “election”. Elections, according to her, were only possible at annual general meetings.

</div>
</div>
</div> In support, she relied on s 53(4) of the Act (“All the members of the council of a management corporation shall be elected at each annual general meeting of the management corporation”). Therefore “general meeting” in the second limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) referred to an <span class="font-italic">annual</span> general meeting. I am not persuaded by this argument either. Section 53(4) of the Act simply means that annual general meetings always host elections for council membership. It does not mean that annual general meetings are the exclusive venues for election to council membership. Moreover, extraordinary general meetings are perfectly capable of hosting elections for council members too: Teo Keang Sood, <span class="font-italic">Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at [9.19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Chan also pointed to s 27(3) of the Act. This provision states that “the First Schedule shall apply to and in respect of <span class="font-italic">any</span> meeting of a management corporation, and voting at that meeting” (emphasis added). The implication was that “general meeting” in the second limb of s 54(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) could therefore refer to annual general meetings as well.

</div> This was misconceived. Section 27(3) of the Act merely meant that the First Schedule, as a whole, applies to all types of meetings. It does not follow that every provision in the First Schedule applies to every type of meeting. Such a statutory purpose would have been achieved by phrasing to the effect that “every reference to meetings in the First Schedule shall be a reference to all types of meetings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For these reasons I refuse to grant the Election Declaration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In closing, I would like to make this comment. The defendant is Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2948. One can easily conclude from the number that there are well over 2,000 entities in Singapore that are governed under the Act (even taking into account those that have been de-registered). Each entity is run by a management council comprising in the main, it would be fair to surmise, persons who are not lawyers or with extensive experience in running meetings. They are volunteers who step up to help administer their estate. The court will take this into account in considering the conduct of chairpersons of general meetings under the Act and will, unless there has been bad faith, lean in favour of the chair. In my view, this is important to discourage the use of the courts in petty quarrels among residents which ought to be resolved through mediation, or by simply voting the delinquent management council out at the next annual general meeting. It will also save the management corporation from having to bear legal expenses of any court action taken against it, which cost will ultimately be borne by all subsidiary proprietors. And it will not discourage people from volunteering to serve in the management council in the spirit of community responsibility, which is a very important principle for the successful governance of entities under the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Chan’s application in this OS is accordingly dismissed.
