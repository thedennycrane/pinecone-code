The defendant claimed that it was simply acting in accordance with a circular issued by the Ministry of Manpower, which stipulated that remote work arrangements remained the default.

</div>
</div> Although remote work arrangements remained the default, it was nevertheless possible for at least one or more of the defendant’s personnel or directors to return to its office from 19 June 2020 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The defendant submitted that even though the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">technically</span> adhered to the proper procedures in serving the writ, the judgment was nevertheless irregular. The defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Melanie Stanley and London Borough of Tower Hamlets </span>[2020] EWHC 1622 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Melanie Stanley</span>”), a decision of the English High Court<span class="font-italic"> </span>concerning an application to set aside a judgment entered in default of appearance during the COVID-19 pandemic. There, the plaintiff had served the relevant documents on the defendant by placing them in the post on 25 March 2020. The deadline for the defendant to acknowledge service of these documents was 9 April 2020. However, by 10 April 2020, the defendant had not acknowledged service and the plaintiff entered judgment in default of appearance against the defendant on 15 April 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Melanie Stanley</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the defendant applied to set aside the default judgment and argued that the default judgment was irregular because the court papers were served when the country was put into “lockdown” (the equivalent of Singapore’s CB Measures) on 25 March 2020. The defendant had closed its office premises on 23 March 2020, just two days before the “lockdown.” The English High Court set aside the default judgment and explained as follows (at [34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The world shifted on its axis on 23 March 2020 and it was incumbent on [the plaintiff’s solicitor] as a responsible solicitor and an officer of the court to contact the [defendant] to acknowledge that the situation had changed, and to discuss how proceedings could best and most effectively be served … I do not find that he unscrupulously took advantage of the situation, but I do find he exercised poor [judgment]. A moment’s thought on his part would have shown that it was not fair or reasonable for him to simply place papers in the post to an office he knew or should have known had been closed down two days before because of a national emergency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I disagreed with the defendant’s submission. In my view, the Default Judgment was clearly a regular judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 <span class="font-italic">Melanie Stanley</span> is distinguishable on its facts. In that case, service was effected at the very start of the “lockdown” period. There was simply no way the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Melanie Stanley</span> could have become aware that court papers had been served on it, in time for it to acknowledge service by the applicable deadline. In the present case, service was effected about one and a half months after the Phase Two Re-opening. Although remote work arrangements remained the default, it had become possible by then for the defendant’s personnel or directors to go to the office. The defendant ought to have made arrangements for at least someone to go to its office, even if not every day, after 19 June 2020 to see if there was anything that needed attending to. This was particularly so, as the defendant knew that the plaintiff had threatened to commence action, through R&amp;T’s second letter of demand. Further, the defendant knew that the plaintiff had not accepted its explanation regarding the alleged set-off. There was no reason for the defendant to think that the plaintiff would hold its hand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there were triable or arguable issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the judgment was a regular judgment, the defendant had to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence that raised triable or arguable issues. First, the defendant submitted that it did not have to pay the plaintiff on the Bills of Exchange because it had a set-off against Phoenix. The defendant submitted that it had mutual trade relations with Phoenix, under which it sold goods to Phoenix and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I rejected the defendant’s submissions. The defendant’s acceptances of the Bills of Exchange were general acceptances (s 19(2) of the Bills of Exchange Act (Cap 23, 2004 Rev Ed) (“BEA”)); there were no conditions attached to the defendant’s acceptances. The defendant’s liability as acceptor of the Bills was clear under s 54(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BEA: by accepting the Bills, the defendant engaged that it would pay the Bills according to the tenor of its acceptances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Further, the rule that a bill of exchange contract is distinct from the original and underlying contract is well established in law: <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Heng v Amixco Asia Pte Ltd </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 654 at [15]. The alleged set-off asserted by the defendant was against Phoenix and had nothing to do with the plaintiff. The defendant had no right of set-off against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, the defendant sought to rely on s 21(3) of the BEA, which states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Delivery</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">21</span>.—(1) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) in order to be effectual must be made either by or under the authority of the party drawing, accepting or indorsing, as the case may be; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Section 21(3) applies as between immediate parties and to a remote party other than a holder in due course. The defendant accepted that the plaintiff was not an “immediate party”. However, it argued that the plaintiff was not a holder in due course because the plaintiff had not given valid consideration. I rejected the defendant’s argument. It was wholly unmeritorious. The plaintiff provided financing to Phoenix by discounting the Bills of Exchange. Clearly, the plaintiff had given consideration for the Bills of Exchange. In my view, s 21(3) was clearly not applicable to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Third, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had recovered the amounts on the Bills of Exchange because the plaintiff’s proof of debt against Phoenix in Dubai had been admitted.
