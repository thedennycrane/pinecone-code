<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. In 1993 one Chua Puay Kiang ("Chua") sued Singapore

Telecommunications Ltd ("Singtel") and two other defendants in Suit 2103 of 1993

("the 1993 action"). Chua was adjudicated a bankrupt on 13 February 1998. The

trial was adjourned for the purpose of obtaining the sanction of the Official Assignee to

proceed. An application was made on 25 June 1998 to change the name of the plaintiff in

the 1993 action from Chua Puay Kiang to "The Official Assignee of the Estate of Chua

Puay Kiang (a bankrupt)". The application was allowed and the trial resumed and

parties made their final submissions to the trial judge. On 30 October 1998 the judge made

the following order:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The plaintiff’s claim be dismissed with one set of costs

  payable to the defendants".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. Singtel commenced this present originating summons before me against

the Official Assignee as defendant for a declaration that when the Official Assignee

becomes a litigant in an action at law, he is liable in the same way as any other litigant

as to costs. Secondly, for a declaration that the Official Assignee is liable to pay the

cots in the 1993 action and thirdly, for an order that the costs be so paid.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. It was submitted by Mr. Lee Cheow Han on behalf of the Official

Assignee that the costs should be paid by a third party guarantor. International

Information Service Pte Ltd subsequently agreed to bear the costs. Mr. Lee submitted that

the third party’s undertaking was given pursuant to the direction of the Registrar,

Supreme Court and that the Official Assignee did not ask for that undertaking.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Mr. Michael Hwang SC, appeared on behalf of Singtel and argued that

the costs are payable by the Official Assignee. The parties exchanged written submissions

on the question as they perceived it to be, namely, whether the Official Assignee is

obliged to pay the costs personally.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. For what appears to be a straightforward matter, it came up for

judicial adjudication in a most unusual way, and I shall revert to this point after I deal

with the meaning and effect of the trial judge’s order.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The judgment extracted by the defendants has no ambiguity. When a

judge rules that the plaintiff pays the costs to the defendant he means just that. In this

case, when the judgment was handed down on 30 October 1998 there was no doubt who the

plaintiff was. It was the Official Assignee. The court was not concerned whether the

Official Assignee pays the costs out of own funds (that is, the funds available to the

office of the Official Assignee, and not the personal funds of the officer who holds that

position, obviously), or from the estate of the bankrupt, or from some third party

guarantor.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. How the Official Assignee arranges funds for the payment of costs of

litigation in such cases is usually not made known to the court and, indeed, the court is

not concerned with that. If the Official Assignee does not sanction the continuation of

the legal proceedings, the proceedings come to an end, effectively.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. However, there will be cases where the Official Assignee may take a

favourable view of the action which, in his opinion, enlarge the wealth of the

bankrupt’s estate to the benefit of the estate and its creditors if successful. In

such cases, he has the discretion to sanction the continuation of the proceedings. He will

often require the comfort of a third party’s guarantee as to costs. If no such

guarantee is forthcoming, the Official Assignee will have to decide whether it is still in

the best interests of the estate and its creditors to continue the legal proceedings. If

he is of the view that it is he may give his sanction and the proceedings carry on. In

both circumstances the opposing party is entitled to apply to the court for security for

his costs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. In this case, it appears from the affidavits filed that some

arrangements were made for a third party company to guarantee the payment of costs, but

this was not an order for security to be provided in substitution of any primary liability

for costs. In this case, the undertaking as to costs was given by the third party to the

Official Assignee. That letter dated 8 June 1998 recites as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"We hereby irrevocably undertake to pay your legal costs in

  respect of the above action.</p>
<p align="justify">This was required pursuant to an order of the learned Registrar Mr.

  Chiam Boon Keng made on 28 May 1998."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. That letter constitutes the undertaking by the third party to pay

"the legal costs" of the Official Assignee. It does not relieve the Official

Assignee of any liability to pay costs if such costs were ordered against him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The judgment of the trial judge carried an unequivocal order that

the plaintiff pay the costs of the defendants. The Official Assignee, being the plaintiff,

is therefore obliged to effect payment. In this regard, it will be useful to remind

ourselves in which mode was the Official Assignee performing his duty. As Cozens-Hardy MR

said in <i>Re Arthur</i> [1913] 2 KB 88, 93: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">when an Official Receiver "is simply performing duties which are

  obligatory upon him in a judicial, or quasi-judicial, character, he is not to be made to

  pay costs, because he is acting in the performance of his official duty; but whenever the

  moment comes when he does that which he is under no obligation to do, although he is

  empowered to do it if he thinks fit, and has a right to do it, then his protection as a

  judicial officer, or a person of a semi-judicial character, ceases, and the court has the

  same jurisdiction to deal with him as with anybody else".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Elsewhere at page 98, Hamilton L.J. expressed the point in these

terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"where the official receiver’s function involve his taking up

  the position of a litigant he in general does so at his own peril as to costs, and there

  is nothing in the Rules to relieve him of that incident in connection with such an

  application as this."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. I now revert to the point I alluded to above in respect of this

unusual application before me. Where, as it must be clear to all at the outset, that the

order to pay costs was made expressly against the plaintiff in the 1993 action, the

successful defendant merely had to proceed with enforcement proceedings if the plaintiff

fails to pay. Mr. Hwang produced before me the authority of <i>Re Sassoon Ezekiel</i>
<nobr>[1933] MLJ 264</nobr> in which costs were ordered against the Official Assignee which he failed

to satisfy and the successful party took out a Writ of Seizure and Sale against the

Official Assignee. Huggard CJ refused the application of the Official Assignee to set

aside the Writ of Seizure and Sale.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. The point I wish to express here is that where a party takes a

particular view as to how a rule of law or an order of court is to be applied he proceeds

forthwith as he may be advised by his counsel. If he is wrong he bears the consequences

accordingly. He ought not to seek the opinion of the court whether his proposed action is

lawful or correct. It is not the function of the court to render opinions in this way.

That is the function of the solicitor. If he thinks or advises that a particular order of

court is not clear the proper procedure is to seek a clarification from the judge who made

it. If he thinks that the order was wrong, his recourse lay in an appeal to a superior

court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Courts do not make declarations merely to state the obvious to give

comfort to a party that a course of action he proposes to take is the correct one in law.

A declaration will be made only if it will resolve a specific dispute between the parties

when that dispute has come to a boil. That is to say, the parties have done all that needs

to be done and a genuine dispute as to the rights and entitlement of the parties have

clearly arisen to which nothing else can be done except to proceed to court for

adjudication. In this case, there is no doubt a dispute between the plaintiff (Singtel)

and the defendant (the Official Assignee) but the plaintiff ought to have commenced

enforcement proceedings to enforce its judgment against the Official Assignee who they say

the judgment was directed against. The court’s intervention need only be invoked

when, and if, the Official Assignee applies to set aside the enforcement proceedings. The

prolixity of the orders sought from me under this OS is manifest. The trial judge had

ordered the plaintiff (the Official Assignee) to pay costs. Mr. Hwang now wants me to

declare that that it so. Given his interpretation of the order, this Originating Summons

was unnecessary. The fact that I agree with his interpretation does not justify this

application before me. How he is to enforce the order of the court in the 1993 action is a

matter for Mr. Hwang to advise his clients.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. For the reasons that I had just set out, I will make no order in

respect of this Originating Summons. </p>
