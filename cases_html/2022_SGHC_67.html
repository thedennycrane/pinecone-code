While the plaintiff furnished the purchase price of US$270,000, it is not disputed that the defendant never transferred the shares to her. The crux of the dispute concerns whether the plaintiff was required, under the terms of the Contract, to execute a document known as a Deed of Ratification and Accession (the “DRA”) as a pre-condition to receiving her shares. Executing the DRA would have the effect of binding the plaintiff to a supplemental shareholders’ agreement, which had been signed by Xeitgeist’s pre-existing shareholders on 28 November 2013 (“1SSA”), prior to the conclusion of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff has been the director of Beetroot Investments Pte Ltd (“Beetroot”) since 19 March 2008.

In my view, the dispute over <span class="font-italic">when </span>the Contract was concluded is, ultimately, somewhat of a red herring. As I noted above at [1], the crux of the present dispute really concerns <span class="font-italic">what </span>the terms of the Contract are, or more specifically, whether the signing of the DRA was a term of the Contract. Given that it is undisputed that the terms of the Contract are contained in e-mails exchanged between the parties between 30 January and 14 February 2017 (see [5] above), the terms of the Contract may be ascertained with reference to these e-mails alone, without having to decide the issue of precisely when or on which date the Contract was concluded. That being said, as the defendant has made the somewhat contradictory submission that the Share Transfer Deed signed on 12 April 2017 <span class="font-italic">also </span>incorporated the obligations under the 1SSA as terms of the Contract (see [25] above), I consider it prudent to nonetheless address the issue of when the Contract was formed. Moreover, in deciding <span class="font-italic">what </span>the terms of the Contract are, it would in any case be useful to identify the point in time at which the Contract was concluded, since the parties would, by that time, have agreed on all material terms of the Contract. As such, I first address the anterior issue of when the Contract was concluded, before moving on to Issue 2 proper. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my judgment, I am unable to see any basis for the defendant’s contention that the Contract was only concluded on 12 April 2017. First, it is unclear to me what the defendant means by the statement that the Contract was only “accepted, and consequently concluded” on 12 April 2017; this was not part of the defendant’s pleaded case and was raised for the <span class="font-italic">first </span>time in the defendant’s closing submissions.

</div> If the purport of the defendant’s argument is that the parties had only been in negotiations prior to 12 April 2017, such that the plaintiff only <span class="font-italic">accepted </span>the defendant’s offer to purchase Xeitgeist shares on 12 April 2017, I find that this contention is plainly contradicted by the evidence. Based on the e-mail correspondence between the parties, it is clear that the plaintiff’s acceptance of the defendant’s offer occurred much earlier. As early as 1 February 2017, the defendant had instructed Jeremy that “Simran will be acquiring USD300,000 of my Xeitgeist stock” at a 10% discount, and then <span class="font-italic">congratulated </span>the plaintiff on joining the Xeitgeist team.

</div> Clearly, by 14 February 2017, the parties were well past the point of negotiating the Contract. Offer and acceptance had been completed. I therefore find that by 14 February 2017 at the latest, the Contract had been concluded and its essential terms were agreed, namely that the defendant would sell and transfer to the plaintiff 82,192 Xeitgeist shares held in his name, in return for the sum of US$270,000 to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 To the extent that the parties continued liaising after 14 February 2017 on the signing of the Share Transfer Deed, these communications related only to the paperwork or formalities necessary to execute the Contract. For instance, the day before the parties signed the Share Transfer Deed, the defendant e-mailed Jeremy to inform him that he would be meeting the plaintiff the next day, and that the plaintiff’s “paper work and transfer will be initiated this week”.

</div> The plaintiff’s and defendant’s signing of the Share Transfer Deed on 12 April 2017 was simply an executory step of the Contract, and did not signify, as the defendant contends, the conclusion of the Contract on that date. With this in mind, I now turn to consider Issue 2. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: What were the terms of the Contract?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In cases such as the present one, where at least on the parties’ cases, there is no single document containing all the terms of the Contract, the court is entitled to consider all relevant documents as well as testimony in order to ascertain the terms of the Contract: <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at [7]. Given that it is not disputed that the terms of the Contract are contained in the e-mail correspondence between the parties from 30 January to 14 February 2017 (see [5] above), I direct my attention to this series of e-mail exchanges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Based on the e-mails exchanged from 30 January to 14 February 2017, it is clear to me that the signing of the DRA was<span class="font-italic"> not </span>a term of the Contract.

As noted above at [12], when the plaintiff sent an e-mail on 14 February 2017 querying if she needed to conclude a separate contract for the transfer of the Xeitgeist shares, Grace assured the plaintiff that she only needed to provide TKNP with the original signed Share Transfer Deed and a scanned copy thereof, in order to complete the share transfer process. Grace’s e-mail stated as follows:

However, the defendant did not do this. Instead, the defendant reiterated that the plaintiff only needed to “basically … sign the paperwork” and make payment of US$270,000.

</div> In my view, this suggests that even if the plaintiff received a draft DRA in February 2017, the parties did not actually contemplate or even consider that the plaintiff should sign the DRA any time before April 2017. Had the parties agreed that the signing of the DRA would be a term of the Contract, it did not make sense for TKNP to send the plaintiff a draft DRA with no relevant information filled in, assure the plaintiff she only needed to sign the Share Transfer Deed to complete the share transfer, and then send the plaintiff a re-drafted DRA in April 2017 with the plaintiff’s personal information and details of the share transfer filled in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also note that the version of the DRA that the plaintiff received on 24 April 2017 referred to her as a <span class="font-italic">current </span>subscriber of Xeitgeist shares, rather than a prospective shareholder:

In this regard, the signing of the DRA was therefore not a <span class="font-italic">pre-condition</span> to the plaintiff receiving her shares under the terms of the Contract. Rather, it was, in my view, a further formality raised belatedly by the defendant only on 24 April 2017 <span class="font-italic">via</span> TKNP, well <span class="font-italic">after</span> the conclusion of the Contract in February 2017. This may well have been due to an oversight on the part of the defendant or may have simply been something that the defendant raised only as an afterthought. Alternatively, the defendant may have, post-Contract, contemplated the plaintiff signing the DRA as part of a process to <span class="font-italic">further</span> transfer the shares <span class="font-italic">from</span> the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">to</span> her company, Beetroot, which indeed was the impression that the plaintiff had from TKNP’s e-mails (as detailed below at [112]). In any case, <span class="font-italic">why </span>the defendant raised the issue of signing the DRA belatedly is ultimately an issue that is unnecessary for me to decide for the purposes of ascertaining the terms of the Contract. For present purposes, what matters is that on the evidence before me, the signing of the DRA was not contemplated by the parties at the time the Contract was concluded, and therefore cannot reasonably be a term of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am also not persuaded by the defendant’s argument that the obligation to sign the DRA was somehow incorporated as a term of the Contract, when the parties signed the Share Transfer Deed on 12 April 2017 (see [25] above). Given the defendant’s concession that the terms of the Contract are contained in the e-mails exchanged from 30 January to 14 February 2017, and my conclusion that the Contract was concluded by 14 February 2017 (at [34] above), I do not see how the Share Transfer Deed signed <span class="font-italic">later</span> on 12 April 2017 could somehow incorporate terms into the Contract which had been concluded at an earlier point in time. In this regard, I note that neither party pleaded nor contended that the terms of the Contract were varied at any time after 14 February 2017. As a document, the Share Transfer Deed was therefore, at best, merely evidence of the Contract and its terms which had already been agreed upon by 14 February 2017. Likewise, the execution of the Share Transfer Deed was, at most, a step contemplated in the performance of the Contract. In the circumstances, even if the Share Transfer Deed states that the plaintiff would purchase the Xeitgeist shares subject to the same “several conditions” on which the defendant held his shares, I disagree that this incorporates the signing of the DRA as a term of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any case, I am not convinced that the wording of the Share Transfer Deed alone is sufficient to incorporate the terms of the 1SSA and the obligation therein to sign a DRA. The defendant may be right to contend that a party is, generally, bound by the terms of a contract it signs even if it does not read or understand those terms. However, where it is argued that terms in another document have been incorporated into a contract by reference, the defendant’s contention above only holds true when the relevant terms have been incorporated into the contract by an <span class="font-italic">exp</span><span class="font-italic">ress</span> incorporating clause<span class="font-italic">: </span><span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another </span>[2019] 2 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Bintai</span><span class="font-italic"> Kindenko</span>”) at [60]–[61]. On the contrary, in the absence of an express incorporating clause, onerous and unusual conditions cannot be incorporated unless the attention of the party sought to be bound has been specifically drawn to them: <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span><span class="font-italic"> Kindenko </span>at [60]–[61]; see also <span class="font-italic">Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd v Lau Yew Choong and another suit</span> [2017] 5 SLR 268 at [122]. On the facts before me, I am not persuaded that the reference to “several conditions” in the Share Transfer Deed is the equivalent of an express incorporating clause. Rather, I find that the obligations attendant upon the incorporation of the terms of the 1SSA, such as the signing of a DRA, can be characterised as “onerous and unusual”, since signing the DRA would have the effect of binding the plaintiff to the “drag-along provision” (see [23] above). Accordingly, I find that such obligations, in the absence of an express incorporating clause in the Contract, cannot be incorporated unless the plaintiff was specifically alerted to them at the time the Contract was concluded. I have already found that the plaintiff was not alerted to them at any time up to 14 February 2017, which is the latest time by when the Contract was concluded (see [39] above). Therefore, the wording of the Share Transfer Deed alone would not in any event suffice to incorporate the terms of the 1SSA into the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The defendant also relies on <span class="font-italic">International Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 130 (“<span class="font-italic">International Research</span>”) in support of its contention that the Share Transfer Deed incorporates the obligations of the 1SSA. The defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">International Research </span>does little to advance its case. As the defendant itself observes, <span class="font-italic">International Research </span>stands for the proposition that “[t]he task before the court in determining whether or not there has been incorporation by reference is one of construction, namely, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to ascertain the parties’ intentions when they entered into the contract by reference to the words that they used</span>” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]: at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It was for this reason that I found it irrelevant that the plaintiff conceded in cross-examination that she wanted some of the benefits of the Shareholders’ Agreements, or that she supposedly accepted that the defendant was bound by the Shareholders’ Agreements.

</div> These facts pertain to the plaintiff’s subjective knowledge or intentions; what matters is the intentions of the parties, objectively ascertained, <span class="font-italic">at the time</span> the Contract was concluded (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 14 February 2017). Looking at the e-mails between the parties during that time, there was simply no discussion at all of the plaintiff being bound by the Shareholders’ Agreements, let alone the signing of the DRA (as I have already noted above at [36]). The defendant also concedes that there is no express reference in the Share Transfer Deed to the Shareholders’ Agreements or the DRA.

</div> In the premises, I cannot see how one can reasonably conclude that the parties had an objectively ascertainable intention to incorporate either the 1SSA or the obligations contained within the 1SSA into the Contract, through the <span class="font-italic">later</span> signing of the Share Transfer Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49  I turn now to consider the defendant’s argument that the 1SSA, and the obligation therein to sign the DRA, were incorporated into the Contract through his e-mail on 1 February 2017, when he instructed Jeremy to provide the plaintiff with the “associated shareholders agreements” for her “review and signing” (see above at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Applying the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span><span class="font-italic"> Kindenko </span>as detailed above at [46], I am likewise unconvinced that the reference in the defendant’s e-mail to “associated shareholders agreements” for the plaintiff’s “review and signing” can be construed as, or having the same effect as, an express incorporation clause. In addition, on the evidence before me, it is clear that the defendant did not intend by his e-mail of 1 February 2017 to incorporate the 1SSA into the Contract. When Grace followed up on the defendant’s instructions to provide the plaintiff with the “associated shareholders agreements”, her e-mail of 8 February 2017 expressly stated that the enclosed Shareholders’ Agreements were for the plaintiff’s “reference” only.

</div> I reject this argument for two reasons.

</div> No explanation has been offered by the defendant to explain the contradiction between his testimony and his submissions. Secondly, this submission lacks plausibility. If the defendant had indeed wanted to incorporate the Shareholders’ Agreements into the Contract, it makes little sense that the defendant would inform the plaintiff (through TKNP) that the Shareholders’ Agreements were for her “reference” only, and thereafter execute a Share Transfer Deed that made no express mention of these Shareholders’ Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In any case, even if the defendant’s e-mail of 1 February 2017 is evidence that he wanted the plaintiff to be bound by the Shareholders’ Agreements <span class="font-italic">at some point</span>, I do not think it proves that the parties intended for the plaintiff to be bound by the obligations under the Shareholders’ Agreements as a <span class="font-italic">pre-condition </span>to receiving the Xeitgeist shares from the defendant under the Contract. Nothing to this effect was communicated in the defendant’s e-mail of 1 February 2017. In my view, the Shareholders’ Agreements were, at best, <span class="font-italic">separate </span>contracts that the defendant proposed the parties should enter into. They should not be conflated with the terms of the Contract, under which it was not an express term or a pre-condition that the plaintiff would be bound by the obligations in the Shareholders’ Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For the foregoing reasons, I reject the defendant’s contention that the 1SSA, and the obligation therein to sign the DRA, were incorporated into or formed any part of the terms of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For completeness, I address the defendant’s argument that a term should be implied into the Contract, that the plaintiff would cooperate with the defendant to execute the necessary documents, including the signing of the DRA, to perfect the transfer of shares.

</div> It is not disputed that in determining whether to imply a term into a contract, the court will apply the three-step test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”), namely that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court will ascertain if there is a gap in the contract and if so, how the gap arises.

</div> Absent any proof that such administrative requirements are themselves <span class="font-italic">necessary</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in the interest of efficacy, the defendant’s insistence on the signing of the DRA is, in my view, a self-created impediment to contractual performance.

As the defendant submits, an innocent party will have the right to terminate the contract when the other party “by his words or conduct, simply <span class="font-italic">renounces</span> its contract inasmuch as it clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that it <span class="font-italic">will not perform its contractual obligations at all</span>” [emphasis original]: <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”) at [93].

The plaintiff had paid the defendant for the Xeitgeist shares by May 2017, and yet the defendant failed to transfer the shares to her, despite the plaintiff being included as a shareholder in Xeitgeist’s Shareholders’ Circulation List in November 2017.

The state of affairs remained for almost two years with no steps being taken to transfer the shares to the plaintiff, and continued to be the case when the plaintiff elected to terminate the Contract in January 2019 by a letter from her solicitors.

</div> Even if TKNP had informed the plaintiff on 16 June 2017 that they were awaiting the signed DRA before they would forward her the share certificates, there appears to have been no follow-up since then. On the evidence before me, the last correspondence between the parties pertaining to the Contract was on 17 June 2017, following which the next communication was the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of termination in January 2019.

</div> No explanation has been provided for why the defendant decided to sit on his hands for close to two years.

</div> It does not say much about the defendant’s willingness to perform his end of the bargain when considered against his complete inaction for nearly two years. Nor do I consider it relevant that the plaintiff represented to TKNP on 17 June 2017 that she would “sign and send” the DRA shortly.

</div>
</div> Given my conclusion that the plaintiff is not required to sign the DRA under the terms of the Contract, the signing of the DRA is a wholly separate issue and does not, in my judgment, change the fact that the defendant failed to perform his obligations under the Contract. Moreover, as I noted above at [44], it is possible that the parties contemplated the signing of the DRA as part of the process to further transfer the Xeitgeist shares from the plaintiff to Beetroot. As I detail below at [112], this was indeed the plaintiff’s understanding of why she was asked to sign a DRA. Any discussions between 24 April and 17 June 2017 on the plaintiff signing the DRA therefore do not, in my view, detract from the analysis of whether the defendant, by his actions and conduct, evinced an intention to still be bound by the Contract or otherwise. This is especially so when viewed against the backdrop of the defendant doing nothing after 17 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Finally, I disagree with the defendant that the facts of the present case are analogous to those in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>, the plaintiff had formed the preliminary view that it was entitled to withhold performance under the sub-contract. However, as the sub-contract referenced certain terms from the main contract, the plaintiff requested the defendant to provide it with a copy of the main contract, so that it could “review” the defendant’s demand that the plaintiff effect contractual performance (at [71]). Without providing the plaintiff with a copy of the main contract, the defendant instead alleged that the plaintiff had renounced the sub-contract and elected to terminate the contract. Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon (as he then was) held that the plaintiff’s conduct did not evince its intention to renounce the sub-contract as it was simply “attempting to understand the defendant’s position” (at [74]). Accordingly, the court held that the defendant had unlawfully terminated the sub-contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The present case is not, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>, a situation where one party was simply trying to clarify the extent of its contractual obligations. As I noted at [61] above, the defendant in the present case did not, from the available evidence, even contact the plaintiff for close to two years after June 2017 regarding performance of the Contract. Short of an express statement from the defendant that he refused to transfer the Xeitgeist shares to the plaintiff, there can hardly be any clearer indication that the defendant was, by his conduct and complete silence, unwilling to perform his side of the bargain – in my judgment, that was sufficient to constitute conduct amounting to a repudiatory breach of the Contract. <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation </span>therefore does not assist the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the reasons detailed above, I find and hold that the defendant’s conduct had the effect of renouncing the Contract, such that the plaintiff was entitled to accept the defendant’s repudiation of the Contract and terminate it. The plaintiff duly exercised that right of termination through her solicitors’ letter of 8 January 2019, which expressly accepted the defendant’s repudiatory breach.

The plaintiff claims a sum of US$270,000, representing the amount that she transferred to the defendant for the Xeitgeist shares; as stated at [16] above, the precise amount transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant was S$377,190. For convenience and unless the context otherwise requires me to, I will refer to the sum paid in US Dollars (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$270,000). The defendant rightly observes that the plaintiff’s claim is one for reliance losses, and that there is a line of authority for the proposition that a party will not be allowed to claim reliance losses to escape a bad bargain.

A promisee who has made a bad bargain would not have recovered its reliance expenditure in full even if the promisor had performed its obligations under the contract. When the contract is breached, to compensate that promisee by an award of its reliance loss would put the promisee in a position better than it would have been in had the contract been performed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 What stands out to me from the above passages is that the burden is on the promisor, being the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> in this case, to prove that the bargain the plaintiff entered into was in fact a bad one.

However, even within the field of contract, the law’s answer to this question is a rebuttable ‘no’, and it has reached this position by relieving the plaintiff of the burden of proving that, had the contract be [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] performed, sufficient revenue would have been earned <span class="font-italic">at least</span> to cover his reasonable capital outlay and expenses.

Given that the plaintiff had furnished the purchase price for the Xeitgeist shares on 8 May 2017, she would have been entitled to the shares from that point onward. The defendant has not led any evidence on the valuation of the Xeitgeist shares as of 8 May 2017, or any time after that.

</div> It goes without saying that the valuation of shares may be determined by a multitude of factors including a company’s projected growth. In the absence of direct evidence on the valuation of Xeitgeist shares in May 2017, I hesitate to treat Xeitgeist’s financial statement for the financial year ending on 31 December 2017 as a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the Xeitgeist shares were worthless. In this case, if I had to fix a point in time when the defendant’s breach occurred, I would be prepared to proceed on the assumption that the shares ought reasonably to have been transferred to the plaintiff by the end of June 2017, following payment by the plaintiff of the purchase price on 8 May 2017. No evidence was led by the defendant that as of 30 June 2017, the Xeitgeist shares were worthless. Even taking the plaintiff’s pleaded case that a reasonable period within which the shares ought to have been registered with ACRA was no more than three months after the purchase price had been paid (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 8 August 2017),

</div>, I note that this price appears to be a back-of-the-envelope calculation. There has also been little evidence led on the circumstances surrounding the proposed buyout of Xeitgeist by Xeitgeist UAE, or how Xeitgeist came to be valued at US$2m in May 2018. I therefore find that this approximation of the value of Xeitgeist’s shares in May 2018 cannot be authoritative or bear probative value. I also take into account the fact that the defendant himself has never asserted that the Xeitgeist shares <span class="font-italic">are</span> presently worthless or were worthless at any material time, including in June 2017. On the contrary, the defendant maintained that at the time, Xeitgeist had a good number of movies in the pipeline including “Hotel Mumbai”, had a sizeable intellectual property library as part of its asset base, and had healthy revenue projections.

</div> The latter case concerned an agreement that the defendant would transfer shares (the “INS shares”) to the plaintiff as repayment for a loan by 24 April 2011 (at [4]). In breach of the agreement, the defendant failed to transfer the INS shares to the plaintiff by that date. Nonetheless, Coomaraswamy J observed that even if the INS shares had been duly transferred to the plaintiff, the share transfer would have been nullified in August 2011 by an order of court obtained by two of INS’ shareholders (at [23]). Moreover, even though no evidence was adduced on the value of the INS shares as of 24 April 2011, the learned Judge found it was “manifest” that the INS shares had become worthless, as INS went into insolvent liquidation in February 2013 (at [24]). In any case, if it had been necessary to make a finding on the value of the INS shares as of 24 April 2011, Coomaraswamy J noted that he would have found the INS shares to be worthless on that date, because of the financial difficulties that INS was facing and the internal shareholder conflict which afflicted the company (at [24]). In the circumstances, the learned Judge found that the plaintiff had made a bad bargain and would be barred from claiming reliance losses (at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Based on the evidence placed before me, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiang Tien </span>are clearly not on all fours with the present case. In the case before me, had the defendant transferred his shares to the plaintiff, there is no suggestion that this share transfer would be nullified or in any way invalidated, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiang Tien</span>. Moreover, at least on the evidence adduced by the parties, there is no allegation that Xeitgeist has since entered insolvent liquidation. In addition, as I noted above at [69]–[70], I am not prepared to conclude that it is “manifest” that the Xeitgeist shares were worthless as of June 2017 (or 8 August 2017), based on the evidence that was led at trial. In any case, I note that the analysis and findings in <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiang Tien</span> on this issue were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and unnecessary for the decision, as the plaintiff’s claim in that case for damages arising from breach of contract was found to be time-barred (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For the foregoing reasons, I therefore agree with the plaintiff that she is entitled to claim for her reliance losses, which in this case, translate to the sum paid by her to the defendant as the purchase price for the shares. As I noted above at [66], the plaintiff claims a sum of US$270,000. However, in my view, a more accurate and proper quantification of the plaintiff’s damages would be the sum actually paid by the plaintiff and received by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>S$377,190 (being the approximate Singapore Dollar equivalent of US$270,000).

</div> I therefore award the plaintiff damages in the sum of S$377,190. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Whether the plaintiff is entitled to restitution by reason of total failure of consideration and/or unjust enrichment</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure of consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As an alternative ground for my decision, I turn to consider the plaintiff’s claim in restitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is well-established that for a claim grounded on failure of consideration to succeed, the failure of consideration must be <span class="font-italic">total</span>: <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto v Supercars</span>”) at [53]. What amounts to “consideration”, or the basis of the transfer, must be objectively determined based on what is communicated between the parties; not every expectation which a party has in making a transfer forms part of the basis for that transfer: <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto v Supercars</span> at [51]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Bearing this in mind, I am satisfied that there has been a total failure of consideration on the present facts. Looking at the e-mails between the parties with an objective lens, I find that the parties regarded the share transfer as a straightforward transaction: the plaintiff would pay the defendant US$270,000 for 82,192 Xeitgeist shares, nothing more and nothing less. In all the e-mails between the parties leading up to the payment to the defendant on 8 May 2017, there was simply no other basis mentioned for the transfer of the US$270,000. The parties also regarded the share transfer as a transaction <span class="font-italic">separate</span> from any of their other business dealings. For instance, in his e-mail to the plaintiff on 30 January 2017, the defendant outlined the share transfer as a proposal distinct from the plaintiff’s potential direct investment into Hotel Mumbai, or her tenure on Xeitgeist’s advisory panel as an Indian cultural advisor.

As such, any additional benefits that the plaintiff received from her general association with Xeitgeist cannot be said to be benefits that the plaintiff “bargained for under the contract” (<span class="font-italic">Ooi</span><span class="font-italic"> Ching Ling v Just Gems Inc</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 14 at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In any case, I note that some of these additional benefits were not even conferred upon the plaintiff in her capacity <span class="font-italic">qua </span>shareholder.

In addition, it would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be inequitable to require a payee to make restitution, if the expenditure might in any event have been incurred by him in the ordinary course of things: <span class="font-italic">De Beers </span>at [36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I turn to the facts before me. As a preliminary point, I note that the defence of change of position applies <span class="font-italic">pro tanto</span> and the payee will only be allowed to keep that part of the money which he has disposed of: <span class="font-italic">De Beers </span>at [52]. This means that even if the defendant in the present case succeeds in establishing the defence of change of position, he would only have a <span class="font-italic">partial </span>defence to the plaintiff’s claim in restitution, since he received S$377,190 from the plaintiff but incurred, on his own best case, expenditure amounting to a <span class="font-italic">lesser</span> sum of S$207,565.71. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In any case, I am doubtful that the defendant has adduced sufficient evidence to even prove the first element of his defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>that he changed his position. In this regard, the defendant relies on his DBS Account statement for the month of May 2017, as well as several miscellaneous receipts and documents that the defendant claims prove the expenditures he incurred as a result of the payment from the plaintiff.

Moreover, after the plaintiff filed a notice of non-admission to the authenticity of these documents, the defendant conceded that he was “unable to take any further steps to prove the authenticity of those documents”, save for two documents (namely, the defendant’s DBS Account statement and the tenancy agreement for the Grange Road property).

Neither was this a case where the defendant sought to rely on the presumption under s 116A(2) of the EA, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumptions in relation to electronic records</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">116A</span>.—(1) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, the court shall presume that any electronic record generated, recorded or stored is authentic <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if it is established that the electronic record was generated, recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by a person who was not a party to the proceedings </span>on the occasion in question and who did not generate, record or store it under the control of the party seeking to introduce the electronic record.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-italic">A</span> seeks to adduce evidence against <span class="font-italic">B</span> in the form of an electronic record.

The defendant may well have been able to rely on s 116A(2) of the EA to prove the (presumed) authenticity of the electronic DBS Account statement, had he obtained evidence to prove that the said statement was a record “generated, recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business” by DBS. However, the defendant did not do so, and did not in any case advance any arguments on s 116A(2) of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Likewise, with regard to the tenancy agreement for the Grange Road property, following from the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">CIMB v World Fuel</span> (see above at [88]), the first step to proving authenticity would have been for the defendant to produce the original tenancy agreement before the court. This was not done. I note that in his closing submissions, the defendant argues that pursuant to s 67(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA, he should be entitled to rely on a copy of the tenancy agreement as secondary evidence as he “was in Australia at the time of the trial and was consequently not able to produce the original of the Tenancy Agreement”.

</div> Yet, this certificate of stamp duty was ultimately not adduced in evidence. Accordingly, I cannot see what the defendant relies on to prove the authenticity of the tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the circumstances, I find that the defendant has not discharged its burden of proving the authenticity of the documents it seeks to rely on to establish the defence of change of position. Given that authenticity is a “necessary condition” of admissibility, those documents are therefore not admissible in evidence: <span class="font-italic">Super Group Ltd v Mysore </span><span class="font-italic">Nagaraja Kartik </span>[2018] SGHC 192 at [53].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In addition to my reasons above, I am also of the view that there is insufficient evidence of a <span class="font-italic">causative link</span> between the defendant’s expenditure and the transfer from the plaintiff, or similarly, that the defendant would not have incurred the expenditure in the ordinary course, such that it would be inequitable to require him to make restitution. The defendant contends that he would not have incurred the expenditure of S$207,565.71 but for the receipt of money from the plaintiff, as he only had S$396.97 in his DBS Account immediately prior to receiving the money from the plaintiff.

</div> In my judgment, this observation alone says little about what the defendant’s expenditure would otherwise have been, had the plaintiff not transferred to him the sum of S$377,190 on 8 May 2017. The defendant’s evidence at trial was that he drew an annual salary of S$240,000 from Xeitgeist in 2016 and 2017.

</div>
</div> Moreover, as is clear from the defendant’s own evidence, he has at least two bank accounts, namely the DBS Account and the SCB Account. Accordingly, the mere fact that the defendant had S$396.97 in his DBS Account on 7 May 2017 does not necessarily show the <span class="font-italic">entirety</span> of his means, nor does it indicate that he would not have incurred the expenditure of S$207,565.71 <span class="font-italic">but for</span> the payment received from the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In addition, and turning to examine the specific expenses that the defendant incurred, I note that the defendant conceded that he would have had to pay rent on the Grange Road property (S/N 1 in the table at [81] above) <span class="font-italic">regardless</span> of whether he received payment from the plaintiff.

</div> This was therefore not an extraordinary expense that the defendant incurred as a result of the payment from the plaintiff. Likewise, it is unclear what expenses the defendant had used the credit cards linked to his SCB account for (S/N 11 in the table at [81] above), and accordingly, it cannot be said on a balance of probabilities that these were extraordinary expenses. As for the remaining items of expenditure incurred by the defendant, these related to unsecured loans extended to Xeitgeist and purported expenses of Xeitgeist. Crucially however, there was no evidence led either through affidavit or at trial, that these expenses would not have been incurred by the defendant in the ordinary course. The mere fact that the defendant was not “legally obliged” to make such payments does not prove that he would not have incurred such expenses in the ordinary course.

As the learned editors of Goff &amp; Jones,<span class="font-italic"> The Law of Unjust Enrichment </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) (“Goff &amp; Jones”) note at [27–03]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To develop the [change of position] defence in a principled way the courts must understand its rationale. The defence generally applies where the benefit transferred from the claimant to the defendant has been <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">irretrievably lost</span> so that the courts must choose which of the parties should bear this loss…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 A loan can hardly be characterised as an “irretrievable loss”, since the lender would ordinarily expect the return of the loan. In any case, the defendant did not adduce any evidence that the money loaned to Xeitgeist <span class="font-italic">was </span>an irretrievable loss. As such, even if the defendant had proven that he would not have extended loans to Xeitgeist but for the payment from the plaintiff, I would be reluctant to find that the change of position defence should be available to the defendant in respect of these loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Finally, I express my doubts that the change of position defence should be available to a defendant who spends a sum of money, in full knowledge that he received the said sum conditional upon his performance of a contractual obligation. The learned editors of Goff &amp; Jones note at [27–58]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">(d) <span class="font-italic">Failure of Basis</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When money is paid to a recipient on an agreed basis, he knows that he may have to repay a like sum if the basis fails to materialise, <span class="font-italic">suggesting that he cannot spend the money in the honest belief that the transferor had an unqualified intention to benefit him.</span> So, for example, if a claimant pays a defendant money to build a house, and the defendant spends it on a holiday that he would not otherwise have bought, the law will almost certainly not permit him to rely on this fact in the event that the house is not built and the claimant sues to recover his money.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In support of this proposition, the editors of Goff &amp; Jones highlight the case of <span class="font-italic">Murray Stan</span><span class="font-italic">ley Goss and another v Laurence George Chilcott</span> [1996] 3 WLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Goss v Chilcott</span>”). The defendants, Mr and Mrs Goss, had borrowed money from a company. This sum of money was then paid to a third party (“Mr Haddon”), as a personal loan from the defendants. Mr Haddon did not return this money, and consequently the defendants failed to repay the loan. The company then sued the defendants. Lord Goff, delivering judgment on behalf of the Privy Council, held that the defendants had received the money on the basis that they covenanted to repay the loan, and that having failed to do so, the company therefore had a claim in restitution for total failure of consideration (at 187–188). In this regard, Lord Goff rejected the argument that the defendants were entitled to the change of position defence, simply because they had paid away the money to Mr Haddon. Lord Goff observed (at 189):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">From the beginning, the defendants were under an obligation to repay the advance once it had been paid to them or to their order; and this obligation was of course unaffected by the fact that they had allowed the money to be paid over to Mr. Haddon. The effect of the alteration of the mortgage instrument was that their contractual obligation to repay the money was discharged; but they had nevertheless been enriched by the receipt of the money, and prima facie were liable in restitution to restore it. They had however allowed the money to be paid over to Mr. Haddon in circumstances in which, as they well knew, the money would nevertheless have to be repaid to the company. They had, therefore, in allowing the money to be paid to Mr. Haddon, deliberately taken the risk that he would be unable to repay the money, in which event they themselves would have to repay it without recourse to him. Since any action by them against Mr. Haddon would now be fruitless they are seeking, by invoking the defence of change of position, to shift that loss onto the company. This, in their Lordships' opinion, they cannot do. The fact that they cannot now obtain reimbursement from Mr. Haddon does not, in the circumstances of the present case, <span class="font-italic">render it inequitable for them to be required to make restitution to the company in respect of the enrichment which they have received at the company's expense</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 <span class="font-italic">Goss v Chilcott </span>was followed by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune and another v Depfa ACS Bank (Wikborg Rein &amp; Co, Part 20 defendant)</span> [2012] 2 WLR 199 (“<span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune</span>”). This case concerned a series of swap contracts entered into <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> by Norwegian local authorities, under which the respondent bank (“Depfa”) loaned the local authorities several sums of money, which were then re-invested in financial instruments. These investments were unprofitable and resulted in substantial losses. Depfa brought a claim in restitution to recover the sums advanced to the local authorities. Lord Justice Aikens, delivering the majority judgment, held that the local authorities could not rely on the defence of change of position, as the local authorities had received the money from Depfa on the understanding that they had to repay it (at [124]–[125]). As such, even though the local authorities <span class="font-italic">had </span>acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>when they made the investments, they were the ones who had taken the risk that their investments would fail, rather than Depfa which simply extended a loan on the expectation that it would be repaid. Lord Justice Aikens observed that the “justice of the case” therefore lay with allowing Depfa’s claim in restitution (at [126]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I note that <span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune </span>was applied by Judicial Commissioner Aedit Abdullah (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Supercars </span><span class="font-italic">Lorinser Pte Ltd and another v Benzline Auto Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGHC 281 (“<span class="font-italic">Supercars</span>”). The case concerned payment of a sum of money by the plaintiff (“Supercars”) to the defendant (“Benzline”), ahead of entry into an exclusive dealership agreement. Abdullah JC found that the payment had been made conditional on the parties entering into the exclusive dealership agreement, and accordingly that when the parties failed to form such an agreement, the basis for the payment failed (at [37]). The learned Judicial Commissioner rejected that Benzline was entitled to a change of position defence, observing (at [79]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">79     However, where the basis has been found to have failed, change of position is not made out as a defendant in such a position would know that flowing from such failure, repayment would follow. It is therefore not inequitable to require repayment: <span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune and another v Depfa ACS Bank (Wikborg Rein &amp; Co, Part 20 defendant)</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 579 at [123], [125]. An exception noted in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> is made in respect of situations where the basis requires some advance expenditure, such as a contract requiring work, before it is frustrated, but that is a different situation from what we have here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 However, when the case went on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Benzline</span><span class="font-italic"> Auto v Supercars</span> (as noted at [75] above), the Court of Appeal took the differing view that the payment had not been made conditional on the parties entering into the exclusive dealership agreement (at [66]–[67]). Rather, the Court of Appeal found that the basis for the payment was that Benzline would <span class="font-italic">offer</span> Supercars the exclusive dealership agreement on terms that corresponded in material ways to a prior draft agreement. Given that Benzline had been prepared to execute the exclusive dealership agreement, there had been no failure of consideration (at [68]–[69]). The Court of Appeal therefore disallowed Supercars’ claim in restitution, and consequently did not need to comment on the change of position defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Since the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Supercar</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, it appears that there has been no further development on this aspect of the law: namely, whether the change of position defence is available to a defendant who spends away a benefit, despite knowing that he received the benefit conditional upon his performance of a contractual obligation. From my review of the cases and commentary above, it is not entirely clear which of the three elements of the change of position defence (summarised above at [82]) this question of law relates to. In the extract at [99] above, the editors of Goff &amp; Jones suggest that this is a matter that touches on the question of whether the defendant has acted with an “honest belief”, which in turn suggests that it is the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> that is relevant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second element). On the other hand, the courts in <span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune </span>as well as <span class="font-italic">Supercars</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>appear to have based their analysis in the context of the third element, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it was inequitable in the circumstances to allow restitution. These finer points were, however, not fully canvassed before me and as such, I hesitate to analyse them in any detail or to arrive at any definitive conclusion. In any case, there is no need for me to do so for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Nonetheless, and without expressing any preference between the reasoning of the editors of Goff &amp; Jones and that of the courts in <span class="font-italic">Haugesund</span><span class="font-italic"> Kommune </span>and <span class="font-italic">Supercars</span>, I would express my preliminary agreement with the general proposition that a defendant should not be allowed to rely on the change of position defence in circumstances when he pays away money that he knows he received subject to an obligation on his part to perform. In the present case, the defendant spent over half of the money he had received from the plaintiff, knowing that he had received the money subject to his obligation to transfer the Xeitgeist shares to the plaintiff, and that he had not done so as of May 2017 (when the defendant spent the money). Moreover, even after he had expended the money received from the plaintiff, the defendant persisted in his failure to transfer the Xeitgeist shares to the plaintiff. This failure persisted even as of 30 June 2017, when the defendant ought reasonably to have transferred the shares to the plaintiff, and even as of 8 August 2017, by which time the shares ought, according to the plaintiff, reasonably to have been registered with ACRA (see [69] above). In such circumstances, I fail to see how it would be equitable to allow the defendant to escape making restitution (or inequitable to require him to do so), simply because he spent the money he received with particular expedition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As I stated above at [104], this is a point that is best left to be fully considered on another occasion when the court has had the benefit of full argument. For present purposes, I find that the defendant has not adduced sufficient evidence that he changed his position, that there was a causative link between his expenditure and the payment from the plaintiff, or that he would not have incurred the expenditure in the ordinary course of things. For these reasons, I find that the defendant has failed to establish his defence of change of position.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Alternatively, the defendant argues that the plaintiff is estopped from asserting a total failure of consideration and bringing a claim in restitution, or denying that she had a contractual obligation to sign the DRA, as she made “an explicit representation acknowledging the [execution of the] DRA as a condition precedent to the share transfer” in her e-mail on 17 June 2017.

On the defendant’s own case, he incurred expenditure of S$207,565.71 in <span class="font-italic">May</span> 2017 (see [81] above), <span class="font-italic">before </span>the plaintiff sent her response e-mail on 17 June 2017. It is not the defendant’s case that the plaintiff made any representation to a similar effect at any time before 17 June 2017. I therefore cannot see how the defendant could have spent the said sum in May 2017, in reliance on an e-mail the plaintiff sent only later in June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In any case, in order to establish the defence of estoppel by representation, the defendant must show that (a) there has been a representation of fact; (b) which was relied on by the defendant; and (c) the defendant suffered detriment as a result of the reliance (<span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Bank of China</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 57 at [18]). In this regard, the representation of fact relied on to establish the defence cannot be “promissory in nature” (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye</span> [2013] 2 SLR 715 at [94]); it must be a representation that deals with existing fact rather than future intention (<span class="font-italic">Day, Ashley Francis v Yeo Chin Huat Anthony and others</span> [2020] 5 SLR 514 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis</span><span class="font-italic"> Day</span>”) at [201]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In the present case, I find that the plaintiff’s representations that she could “sign [the DRA] next week” and that she would “sign and send by Friday” are clearly statements of future intention. They did not deal with a state of affairs that was existing as of 17 June 2017. Accordingly, I find that the defendant has not surmounted the first step to establishing estoppel by representation, which is to show that there has been a representation of fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Moreover, in order for the defence of estoppel by representation to be made out, the representation of fact relied upon must be “clear and unambiguous”: <span class="font-italic">Ashley Francis Day </span>at [196].

First, nowhere is it stated in the plaintiff’s e-mail of 17 June 2017 that she would execute the DRA in order to receive the Xeitgeist shares. Second, reading the plaintiff’s e-mail of 17 June 2017 in the context of the prior correspondence between the parties, I find that it is ambiguous why the plaintiff stated that she would execute the DRA. I find it plausible that in her e-mail of 17 June 2017, the plaintiff meant that she would execute the DRA in order to transfer the Xeitgeist shares from her name <span class="font-italic">to Beetroot</span>, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> to transfer the shares from the defendant <span class="font-italic">to her own name</span>.

Thus, when read in context, the plaintiff’s e-mail of 17 June 2017 does not, in my view, constitute a clear and unambiguous representation “acknowledging the [execution of the] DRA as a condition precedent to the share transfer” from the defendant to the plaintiff under the Contract, as contended by the defendant (see [107] above). For completeness, I also consider it immaterial, for similar reasons, that the plaintiff replied to Grace’s e-mail of 24 April 2017 on the same day, asking for the “share holders [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] agreement to sign” (see [15] above).
