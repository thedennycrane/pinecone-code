The arbitrator in this case declined to hear evidence from all seven of the plaintiff’s witnesses because he was of the view that he was empowered by the procedural rules governing the arbitration to do so.

In this regard, the defendant argues that the plaintiff is precluded from raising issues of jurisdiction past the statutorily permitted time frame given that the plaintiff participated in the arbitration proceedings.

The Buyer further asserted that the Seller had not delivered the outstanding balance of 5,000 MT of coal.

In its covering email, the Bank suggested to the arbitrator that there was <span class="font-italic">no necessity for witnesses to be called</span> as the dispute between the parties turned “primarily on the <span class="font-italic">contractual interpretation” </span>of the second agreement only [emphasis in original].  Furthermore, while the Buyer had put forward a list of witnesses, “it [had] not explained its position/reasons for calling these witnesses”.

</div>  On its part, the Bank informed the arbitrator that it was not intending to call any witnesses or submit any witness statements.  Accordingly, the Bank submitted that the arbitration should proceed on a documents-only basis.  Alternatively, should the arbitrator find that an oral hearing was necessary, the Bank suggested that, pursuant to r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules, such a hearing could be conducted for the hearing of oral submissions only, without the need for any witnesses to be called.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 At this juncture, two points must be noted.  The first is in relation to the arbitrator’s request that parties consider a “documents-only” arbitration (see [26] above).    While there is no fixed definition of a documents-only arbitration, this commonly refers to an arbitration that is to be determined without an oral hearing.  The arbitral tribunal will review the written documents and arguments submitted by the parties before making its decision.  The tribunal does not hold an oral hearing for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument (see <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide </span>(Sundaresh Menon <span class="font-italic">et al</span>) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018) at para 11.041).  The written documents that parties submit may include pleadings, documentary evidence and, in certain instances, witness statements (see, <span class="font-italic">eg, </span><span class="font-italic">Taigo Ltd v China Master Shipping Ltd </span>[2010] HKEC 952 at [5]).  It would be obvious from my description that a documents-only arbitration, where parties have submitted witness statements, would only be available if all parties are of the view that (i) there is no need to cross-examine any of the witnesses on their witness statements, and (ii) they are content to make written submissions to the arbitral tribunal, without the need for any oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The second point is that the precise request of the Bank was for the arbitrator to decide whether there was any need for witness testimony, be it by way of witness statements or oral evidence, in order for the dispute in the arbitration to be determined.  The Bank’s position was that there was no need for any witness testimony.  This is quite different from a request that the arbitrator proceed on a documents-only basis which, as I have explained above, may include the submission of witness statements, but with no cross-examination of the makers of the statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Following the Bank’s proposal for the disposition of witnesses, the arbitrator asked the Buyer to provide “its position/reasons for calling the 7 witnesses and/or the need for their oral testimony.”

Hence, r 25.1 of the SCMA Rules provides the arbitrator with the “widest discretion … to ensure the just, expeditious, economical and final determination of the dispute”, while r 25.2 enables the arbitrator “to decide the arbitration procedure, including all procedural and evidential matters”.

However, the testimony of witnesses can be submitted in written form and the Tribunal may place such weight on the written testimony as it thinks fit, in particular if the witness does not attend the hearing to give oral evidence…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This suggests that the latter portion of r 28.1, which provides that “the Tribunal shall hold a hearing for the presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral submissions” must be read <span class="font-italic">holistically</span>, such that oral submissions cannot be utilised as an <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>to the presentation of evidence by witnesses.  Instead, the SCMA Rules envisage that, where parties have not agreed to a documents-only arbitration, parties must be allowed to call witnesses to give evidence, if they wish to do so.  The point is reinforced by r 30.5 of the SCMA Rules, which allows witnesses to submit their evidence in written form, and for the tribunal to place such weight on the written testimony as it thinks fit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to such order or direction which the Tribunal may make, the testimony of witnesses may be presented in written form, either as signed statements or by duly sworn/affirmed affidavits.

It is only where <span class="font-italic">all </span>parties have decided not to lead oral evidence, or cross-examine any of the witnesses on their witness statements, that a hearing <span class="font-italic">only</span> for oral submissions can be held.  Of course, in that situation, the parties may decide that such an oral hearing is not needed and they may be content to rely on written submissions.  If that transpires, the parties would then have agreed to a documents-only arbitration.  In my view, this holistic reading of r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules appropriately explains the use of the word “or” prior to the words “for oral submissions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In my judgment, r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules has nothing to do with granting the arbitrator the power to limit the evidence that a party may adduce.  It simply deals with when an oral hearing should or should not be held.  Put starkly, it should always be held unless parties agree otherwise.  As to what happens during the oral hearing, this depends on whether the parties wish to lead oral evidence, cross-examine witnesses or just make oral submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The result of the Bank’s reading of r 28.1 of the SCMA Rules would be to grant the arbitrator far wider witness-gating powers (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>allowing the arbitrator to elect for an oral submissions only hearing) than other arbitrators who have been given <span class="font-italic">express </span>witness gating powers under other arbitration rules.  For example, Art 16(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the London Maritime Arbitrators Association Terms (2017) (“LMAA Terms”) permits the tribunal to limit the number of expert witnesses that each party may call “to avoid unnecessary delay or expense”.  Similarly, Art 8.2 of the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010) (“IBA Rules”) allows a tribunal to “limit or exclude any … appearance of a witness” which it considers to be “irrelevant, immaterial, unreasonably burdensome [or] duplicative”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In Lew, Mistelis <span class="font-italic">et al, Comparative International Commercial Arbitration </span>(Kluwer Law International, 2003) (“Lew and Mistelis”), it is observed at para 22-61 that parties are not “always entitled to call and examine witnesses irrespective of the circumstances and the nature of the dispute”.  At para 22-63 of Lew and Mistelis, it is then observed that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a matter of emerging practice written witness testimonies are submitted to or exchanged … within agreed periods of time.  This may well expedite proceedings, especially if the tribunal decides to <span class="font-italic">limit </span>the (direct) oral examination of witnesses…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This suggests that arbitral tribunals may be impliedly vested with the powers to limit the oral testimony of witnesses, and that such powers flow from their power to control the conduct of the arbitration proceedings.  However, while the expeditious disposition of matters is a relevant consideration in arbitration, I think that this does not grant the arbitrator free reign to reject all witness evidence in the interest of efficiency.  Rule 25.1 of the SCMA Rules requires the arbitrator to “ensure the <span class="font-italic">just, expeditious, economical and final </span>determination of the dispute” [emphasis added].  It is thus clear that the expeditious resolution of the dispute is but part of the considerations which an arbitrator must have in mind when determining the process to be adopted; it cannot be the paramount consideration above all other considerations, such as the need to ensure a <span class="font-italic">just </span>determination of the dispute.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The conflict between achieving expediency and a just and fair result was explored in Judith Levine, “Can arbitrators choose who to call as witnesses? (And what can be done if they don’t show up?)” in Albert Jan Van den Berg (ed), <span class="font-italic">Legitimacy: Myths, Realities, Challenges </span>(Kluwer Law International, 2015) (“Levine”).  According to Levine at pp 334 and 336, while “there is consensus that … a tribunal has the power to decide <span class="font-italic">not </span>to hear from a witness”, “[m]ost commentators acknowledge that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the authority to limit witness testimony ‘must be tempered by a tribunal’s duty to afford the parties a fair opportunity to present their case’</span>” [emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold italics].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This is consistent with the authorities which show that, even if arbitral tribunals have the general power to gate witnesses in the interests of efficiency, this cannot be an absolute power that is used to override the rules of natural justice, which demand that parties must be given a fair hearing.  As observed in <span class="font-italic">Dalmia </span>at 270 (citing with approval Shanbhu Dayal Singh’s Law of Arbitration at p 375):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Refusal to examine witnesses. </span>Whether the arbitrators should or should not hear evidence and the parties, must depend on the particular circumstances in every case; and the arbitrators should exercise their discretion in a judicial manner. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If the reference be such that the arbitrators cannot decide the dispute without hearing evidence, the refusal to hear evidence will amount to misconduct. Refusal on the part of the arbitrator to examine witnesses for a party is judicial misconduct warranting the court to set aside the award</span> … Where, however, there is nothing to show that the arbitrator was not acting within his powers and where in the exercise of a prudent and wise discretion he declined to summon the witness, or where the evidence was unnecessary and would not have in any way influenced the decision of the arbitrators, the awards were upheld. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">ADG and another v ADI and another matter </span>[2014] 3 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">ADG</span>”), Vinodh Coomaraswamy J was concerned with r 16.1 of the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (4th Ed, 1 July 2010), which, like r 25.1 of the SCMA Rules in the present case, grants the arbitral tribunal wide and flexible procedure powers “to ensure the fair expeditious, economical and final determination of the dispute.”  At [112] of <span class="font-italic">ADG</span>, the judge observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">wide and flexible procedural power of the Tribunal is, of course, not unqualified: it is subject to the standards set by the rules of natural justice and in particular the right to be heard</span>. But the right to be heard too is not unqualified: it is subject to the standard of reasonableness. By the parties’ agreement, therefore, the Tribunal is entitled to make procedural decisions which give each party a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> right to present its case, after weighing the competing considerations. This includes the need to ensure the fair expeditious, economical and final determination of the dispute (see [<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> <span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972] at [103]). That is not just an ideal which the Tribunal is to pursue; it is an obligation which the Tribunal is to achieve, in consultation with the parties …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The same point was made in <span class="font-italic">Triulzi </span><span class="font-italic">Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span>”) at [131]<span class="font-italic">, </span>where Belinda Ang Saw Ean J observed that, while an arbitral tribunal is the master of its own procedure, its case management powers are not without limits, and are subject to the rules of natural justice, which include the right to be heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Therefore, even if I accept that the arbitrator has the power to gate witnesses under the SCMA Rules, this must be exercised subject to the fair hearing rule.  If the calling of a witness is plainly relevant to a particular issue, an arbitral tribunal cannot gate the witness on the basis of its procedural powers.  Such would be to utilise a procedural power to defeat the substantive rights of the parties.  As observed in Jeffrey Maurice Waincymer, <span class="font-italic">Procedure and Evidence in International Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2012) (“Waincymer”) at p 888:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A tribunal has a duty to promote fairness and efficiency and cannot allow parties to have an open-ended right to have as many witnesses as possible over an extended hearing period. <span class="font-italic">However, a tribunal will need to be careful to ensure that legitimate due process challenges are not encouraged</span>. These might be made on the grounds of failure to allow an adequate presentation of case and/or unequal treatment. Judgment will be needed on a case-by-case basis …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first principle is that the parties can designate the witnesses that they wish to rely upon. It would not be the norm for a tribunal to allow a preliminary debate about whether a particular witness may be called although this is entirely possible under proactive arbitration as a means to <span class="font-italic">exclude superfluous and irrelevant witnesses</span>. Bockstiegel suggests, however, that every witness and expert proposed should be invited to be heard unless the tribunal is sure that the testimony is irrelevant to the outcome of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my judgment, unless the arbitral tribunal has a substantive basis to conclude that all the witnesses sought to be presented are irrelevant or superfluous, such witnesses ought not to be rejected on the basis of efficiency or savings of costs.  Indeed, it is “perfectly acceptable for a tribunal to impose reasonable limits if an excessive number of witnesses are proposed” (Waincymer at p 889), but the tribunal should not reject all the witnesses simply because it is of the <span class="font-italic">preliminary </span>view that all the witnesses would be irrelevant.  Gating must not be utilised as an indirect means of achieving a hearing-by-submissions only, as its fundamental utility is to prevent <span class="font-italic">unnecessary </span>delay.  This can be seen by the relevant arbitration rules which expressly provide for witness gating: apart from the LMAA Terms and the IBA Rules (see [68] above), the World Intellectual Property Organisation Rules (2014) also provides that the tribunal “has discretion, <span class="font-italic">on the grounds of redundance and irrelevance</span>, to limit or refuse the appearance of any witness” [emphasis added].<span class="font-italic"> </span> Many other sets of arbitration rules which have been cited to me by the Bank provide for similar limitations on the arbitral tribunal’s witness-gating powers.  Therefore, consistent with the observations of the commentators above, it is clear that an arbitral tribunal’s witness-gating powers are not absolute, and can only be utilised if it can be seen that the witnesses’ evidence are plainly irrelevant or repetitive.

I recognise that a tribunal has to take into account a myriad of factors when exercising its case management powers to ensure a fair and expeditious conduct of the matter.  Hence, the supervisory role of the court over the tribunal’s exercise of his case management powers ought to be “exercised with a light hand” in the context of a challenge based on the fair hearing rule (<span class="font-italic">Triulzi </span>at [132]).  However, where the conduct complained of is “sufficiently serious or egregious so that one could say a party has been denied due process”, the court may have to step in and find that there has been a breach of the rules of natural justice, in particular the fair hearing rule (<span class="font-italic">Triulzi </span>at [134]; <span class="font-italic">ADG </span>at [116]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The present case involves a sufficiently serious breach of the fair hearing rule such that it <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> warrants curial intervention.

Hence, one could say that the Buyer was justified in refusing to produce those witness statements as directed, as the reason for the direction was for the arbitrator to exercise a discretion which he did not have under the SCMA Rules.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to SCMA Rule 28.1 the final hearing shall be limited to oral submissions only.  There will be no witnesses presented at the final hearing as [the Buyer] has failed to provide witness statements or any evidence of the substantive value of presenting witnesses.  The final hearing shall not be used as an evidentiary mechanism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Such a position taken by the arbitrator might possibly have been warranted if he had made a direction for the submission of the witness statements for the purposes of facilitating the adducing of witness testimony and the presentation of evidence at the oral hearing, and the Buyer then defied, or failed without justification to comply with, such a direction.  But, this was not the reason the arbitrator had directed the Buyer to produce its witness statements in the first place.  It was for a different reason altogether - for him to decide whether to hold a documents-only arbitration.  Ironically, the arbitrator started his email of 20 July 2018 with an acknowledgement that he was bound to hold an oral hearing since both parties had not agreed to a documents-only arbitration. This was effectively an admission that the Buyer’s position on r 28.1 was right all along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In my judgment, insofar as the arbitrator wanted to see the Buyer’s witness statements <span class="font-italic">before</span> deciding whether to allow them to present such evidence at the oral hearing, this was not a power that was available to him under the SCMA Rules.  As explained at [65] to [67] above, the right of a party to call witnesses in support of its case is at the heart of the SCMA Rules.  There is no express witness gating provision in those rules.  Further, the arbitrator seemed to have obtusely ignored the point made by the Buyer’s counsel that four of the witnesses which it intended to call were representatives of the Seller and Entity C, and it was thus impracticable for the Buyer to obtain the written witness statements of those witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 What the arbitrator could have done in the circumstances was to fix the hearing dates for the presentation of evidence and direct the Buyer to produce the witness statements for those witnesses it intended to call at the hearing, insofar as the Buyer was able to do so.  For those witnesses whom the Buyer could not produce witness statements, the onus would then be on the Buyer to procure the necessary subpoenas for those witnesses to be issued by the High Court before the arbitration hearing.  At the hearing, the arbitrator would then have been entitled, pursuant to his powers to manage the hearing efficiently, to set appropriate limits on the amount of time which the Buyer would be entitled to lead oral evidence from the subpoenaed witnesses.  If the arbitrator were to find the evidence of the witnesses to be irrelevant or repetitive, he could <span class="font-italic">further</span> limit the time for the leading of evidence of such witnesses.  In such a situation, he could also make the appropriate costs orders against the Buyer in his award, even if the Buyer succeeded in its defence.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Instead, the arbitrator rejected all of the Buyer’s witnesses.  Following from this, the arbitrator dismissed the Buyer’s contention that it had entered into an agreement with the Seller at the December 2015 meeting to reduce the price of the entire 50,000 MT of coal, as there was no evidence before him of any such agreement.

</div> and through the SWIFT message sent by its bank that the outstanding price was due, do suggest that there was in fact no shortfall in delivery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Nonetheless, the Buyer’s pleaded defence relates to a purported oral agreement that was entered into by the Buyer and the Seller in December 2015, <span class="font-italic">after </span>the documentary evidence above had been recorded.  Therefore, it <span class="font-italic">could </span>be the case that the parties had agreed, at the December 2015 meeting that notwithstanding the Buyer’s earlier concession that the outstanding price was due, a payment of US$61 per MT of coal would constitute a settlement of the outstanding dispute between the parties.  In this regard, I note that, notwithstanding the fact that the receivables to the second agreement had already been assigned by the Seller to the Bank by December 2015, it was not argued by the Bank before me that the representatives of the Seller and or Entity C had no power or authority to enter into the purported settlement agreement on the Bank’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Hence, although there is documentary evidence in support of the Bank’s claim, the strength of such a claim might possibly have faltered had the arbitrator found that an oral agreement existed between the parties.  Such could have clearly led to a different result, in that the Bank’s claim would not have been allowed in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Finally, a point that was made by the arbitrator in his award was that the oral agreement could not have superseded the second agreement in any case.  This is because the second agreement contains the following clauses 19 and 20:

In my view, however, this is not determinative.  The Buyer and Seller could have agreed during the December 2015 meeting to dispense with the strict application of the clauses, or it may be that the terms of the oral agreement are such that the Bank would be estopped from relying on clauses 19 and 20.  The effect of clauses 19 and 20 on the oral agreement is an issue that can only be determined after the testimonies of the witnesses have been considered, which did not happen here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In totality, I am satisfied that there was some actual or real prejudice suffered by the Buyer as a result of the arbitrator’s decision to shut out the evidence of <span class="font-italic">all </span>of its witnesses.  The evidence of such witnesses could have shed light on the existence, as well as the terms, of the purported oral agreement, which could have operated to defeat part of the Bank’s claim in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As all four requirements (see [53] above) for setting aside an arbitration award have been established, I allow the setting aside of the arbitrator’s award in this case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The second and third issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As the award has been set aside of the grounds of breach of natural justice, there is no need for me to deal with the issues surrounding the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, which was relied on as an alternative basis to set aside the award.  In this regard, there is no need to deal with the second issue of whether the Buyer is precluded from raising an objection as to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction by reason of its participation in the arbitral proceedings after the issue of the preliminary award.  There is also no need to deal with the third issue which is, if the Buyer is not so precluded from raising jurisdictional objections, whether the arbitration agreement had not been or could not have been assigned to the Bank, such that the arbitrator was not properly seised of jurisdiction in the matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I find that the arbitrator’s decision to deny the Buyer its right to call all seven witnesses amounted to a breach of the fair hearing rule.  This caused prejudice to the Buyer as the result of the award could have been altered if it had been allowed to lead evidence from the witnesses in relation to the oral agreement, which was fundamental to the Buyer’s defence.  That being the case, I set aside the arbitration award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I will deal with the issue of costs separately.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Clarence Lun Yaodong, Tan Yingxian Selwyn, Lim Jia Ying, Samuel Lim Jie Bin, Giam Zhen Kai and Lin Yu Mei (Foxwood LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Peh Aik Hin, Lee May Ling and Chia Su Min, Rebecca (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
