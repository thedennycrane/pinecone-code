<p xmlns="">by that day, the time for filing the Defence expired. The Plaintiff applied for judgment

in default and the Defendant applied for an extension of time to file her Defence. Her

application contained two alternative prayers: one sought an extension of 14 days from the

date of the order to be made and the other which sought a stay until ‘final

determination’ of the appeal. The Deputy Registrar granted the Defendant an extension

of 14 days on the undertaking of the Plaintiffs’ counsel not to treat the filing of

the Defence as a step taken by the Defendant in the proceedings in view of the appeal on

the Defendant’s application for stay. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">    The Defendant filed this appeal against the Deputy

Registrar’s order. Meanwhile, the appeal on the stay proceedings was dismissed by the

judge-in-chambers. The Defendant had written to the judge to request further arguments,

failing which she intends to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In this appeal, she sought for

an extension of time to file her Defence until she exhausted all avenues of appeal.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, allowing the appeal<b xmlns="">:

<p></p></b>(1)    When a plaintiff’s solicitor is aware that a defendant

has filed an appeal against the refusal to order a stay, he should not insist on the

filing of the Defence pending the hearing of the appeal. This principle applies to an

application for a stay on any grounds and is not confirmed to a challenge based on an

absence of jurisdiction. To insist on the filing of the Defence is wrong because it will

defeat the very purpose of the appeal against the refusal to order a stay. ( 18)

<p xmlns="">(2)    If the plaintiff’s solicitor insists on the filing of the

Defence, the defendant’s solicitor should apply for an extension of time to file

pending the outcome of the appeal. An extension of time should generally be granted so as

not to render the appeal nugatory. ( 19)</p>
<p xmlns="">(3)    Compromise orders that order a defendant to file his Defence

pending his appeal on the stay proceedings provided the plaintiff undertakes not to treat

the filing of the Defence as a step in the proceedings should not be granted for the

following reasons: First, no such compromise orders are granted before the original stay

application is heard and the position should be the same for appeals on stay applications.

Secondly, to insist on the filing of a Defence while an appeal on the stay was pending is

prejudicial to the defendant who has to meet the merits of the plaintiff’s claim

while seeking a stay. Thirdly, if the defendant succeeds in the appeal, he may never have

to meet the plaintiff’s claim on the merits as the plaintiff may abandon his claim in

the alternate jurisdiction. Lastly until all avenues of appeal in relation to a stay

application are exhausted, our courts are not properly seized of the matter. ( 24-29)</p>
<p xmlns="">(4)    On the facts, due to the peculiar words used in the

Defendant’s application for an extension of time and the fact that the Defendant

orally requested for an extension of time and obtained it from the Plaintiffs, a

compromise order was granted as an exception to the general rule that compromise orders

should be granted.( 30)</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font></strong></p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b><i>Background</i></b></p>
<p xmlns="">1.    The Plaintiffs Yeoh Poh San and Choo Lee Chin are husband and wife

and are Malaysian citizens. They claim various sums of money from the Defendant Won Siok

Wan who was a female companion of the First Plaintiff. She is also a Malaysian citizen.

The claim is based on alleged wrongful withdrawals of monies by the Defendant from a joint

bank account in Singapore in the name of the Second Plaintiff and the Defendant. The

source of the monies is allegedly the First Plaintiff. </p>
<p xmlns="">2.    The Writ of Summons was filed in the High Court in Singapore and

the Plaintiffs applied for and obtained leave to serve it, with a Statement of Claim

endorsed thereon, on the Defendant at her residence in Malaysia. </p>
<p xmlns="">3.    After the Defendant was served, her Singapore solicitors entered

an appearance on her behalf and applied for an order that the proceedings be stayed or

dismissed or discontinued on the ground of multiplicity of proceedings or forum non

conveniens. Apparently there were related actions in Malaysia and Thailand as well. </p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The stay application was heard by an Assistant Registrar on 17

April 2002 and was dismissed with costs. There was an alternative prayer in the stay

application for extension of time to file a Defence but apparently this was not pursued

and no order was made thereon. </p>
<p xmlns="">5.    The next day i.e on 18 April 2002, the Defendant filed a Notice of

Appeal to the judge-in-chambers. This was fixed for hearing on 21 May 2002. It was served

on the Plaintiffs’ solicitors on 24 April 2002. In the meantime, the time for filing

the Defence expired. Apparently, someone from the Defendant’s solicitors’ firm

orally asked for and obtained an extension of time to file the Defence. The time for doing

so expired at 4pm of 30 April 2002. Thereafter the Plaintiffs’ solicitors applied for

judgment in default of Defence and the Defendant’s solicitors in turn applied for an

extension of time. The Defendant’s application was not aptly worded. It was couched

in terms seeking an extension to file the Defence within ‘fourteen (14) days from the

date of the order herein or upon final determination of the Defendant’s application

for a stay of the action or its dismissal or discontinuance’. In other words, the

first limb of the prayer only sought an extension of 14 days from the date of the order to

be made and it was the second limb which sought a stay until ‘final

determination’. </p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Both applications were heard before the Deputy Registrar Mr Foo

Chee Hock on 17 May 2002. He made one Order i.e to grant the Defendant an extension of

time of 14 days to file her Defence on the undertaking of the Plaintiffs’ counsel not

to treat the filing of the Defence as a step taken by the Defendant in the proceedings in

view of the pending appeal by the Defendant to the judge-in-chambers. However, he declined

to require a broader undertaking from the Plaintiffs’ counsel i.e for the undertaking

to apply to all steps taken by the Defendant thereafter. </p>
<p xmlns="">7.    The Defendant then filed a Notice of Appeal against this order on

the basis that what the Defendant really wanted was an extension of time to file the

Defence until she exhausted all avenues of appeal. </p>
<p xmlns="">8.    When this appeal came up for hearing before me on 30 May 2002, the

main appeal on the stay application had been heard by Belinda Ang JC and dismissed.

However, the Defendant’s solicitors had written to request further arguments and were

awaiting a response. I was informed that if the request for further arguments was not

successful, for whatever reason, the Defendant would then appeal to the Court of Appeal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><i>Arguments</i></b></p>
<p xmlns="">9.    Counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mr Kuppanchetti, submitted that unless

the jurisdiction of the Singapore court was being challenged on the basis that the court

did not have jurisdiction at all, as opposed to a forum non conveniens argument, the

Defendant should file her Defence. He was prepared to broaden his undertaking below to

apply to any other step which the Defendant may take in the proceedings. This would mean

that pending the outcome of her request for further arguments and any appeal to the Court

of Appeal, no step taken by the Defendant would be construed as being a submission to the

court’s jurisdiction since, after the filing of the Defence, the proceedings would

carry on in the usual manner with pre-trial conferences and directions being given.

Parties would probably be required to file list of documents, conduct inspection of the

documents and file their affidavits of evidence-in-chief. There might also be requests for

further and better particulars and/or interrogatories. </p>
<p xmlns="">10.    Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Andre Arul, submitted that the

Defendant was not obliged to file a Defence pending the final determination of her stay

application. By this, he meant pending the final appeal to the Court of Appeal if the

Defendant was still unsuccessful before Ang JC. </p>
<p xmlns="">11.    Mr Arul stressed that if a Defence or any other step is taken by

the Defendant then that would be a submission to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction.

His alternative argument was that the Deputy Registrar, in granting the Defendant an

extension of time to file the Defence, should have done so on the basis of a broader

undertaking from Plaintiffs’ Counsel so as to apply to any other step that the

Defendant might take after Defence. </p>
<p xmlns="">12.    In paras 26 to 30 of his written submissions, Mr Arul referred to

certain passages from the judgment of Karthigesu JA in<i> The Jarguh Sawit</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45438&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 648</a>. That was a case in which the facts and issues were different from those before

me. Nevertheless, certain parts of the judgment of Karthigesu JA are apposite and I cite

them below: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘30    Firstly, whether or not a

  court has jurisdiction is, of necessity, a question logically prior to the substantive

  dispute of the parties. Unless and <u>until a court is properly seized</u>, it cannot

  adjudicate on the matter…. Thus, our law provides that a party disputing jurisdiction

  may appear before the court to argue the question of jurisdiction (which we hold to be a

  procedural issue) without thereby submitting to the court’s jurisdiction to determine

  substantive issues ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">34    The Rules of Court also contemplate

  that the matter of jurisdiction should be determined once and for all at the interlocutory

  stage. The Rules clearly suggest that jurisdiction is finally determined at the stage

  where an application is made under O 12 r 7 ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">35    A party to an action brought in

  Singapore may dispute jurisdiction after having first entered an appearance by an

  application made by summons under O 12 r 7. This does not amount to a submission to

  jurisdiction: O 12 r 7(5). Order 12 r 7(2) then prescribes that a defendant may dispute

  jurisdiction by making an interlocutory application by a summons in chambers.</font></p>
<p align="justify">36    <u>If the application fails, the defendant may

  appeal against it without thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the court.</u> Once,

  however, it has been <u>finally determined</u> that either no order should be made on the

  application to dispute jurisdiction, or the application is simply dismissed, O12 r 7(5)

  provides that O 12 r 7(6) shall apply. Order 12 r 7(6) provides that a defendant who has

  entered an appearance is to be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the

  court unless the appearance is withdrawn.</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">13.    Mr Arul also referred to a decision of mine in Suit No 224 of

2001 where he was himself the plaintiff and Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskandar

Al-Haj was the defendant. In that case, the defendant applied for a stay of proceedings

before the Singapore court on the ground of forum non conveniens. He failed before a

registrar and before the judge-in-chambers. Pending his appeal to the Court of Appeal, he

applied for an extension of time to file his defence until after his appeal to the Court

of Appeal had been heard and determined. He failed in this application before a registrar

and appealed therefrom to a judge-in-chambers. That appeal was heard by me and I allowed

the appeal i.e I extended the time for filing the defence to after the determination of

the appeal by the Court of Appeal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><i>My decision in the present case</i></b></p>
<p xmlns="">14.    The very reason why a defendant is required to apply for a stay

of proceedings before taking any step other than filing an appearance is because such an

other step may be construed as a submission to the court’s jurisdiction. </p>
<p xmlns="">15.    As a matter of practice, once the stay application is filed, the

plaintiffs’ solicitors will generally not insist on the filing of the Defence pending

the hearing of the stay application. </p>
<p xmlns="">16.    For reasons which I shall elaborate below, the position has

become unnecessarily complicated if the stay application is dismissed. </p>
<p xmlns="">17.    Once a stay application is dismissed. It is not uncommon for a

plaintiff’s solicitors to insist that the Defence be filed even though they are aware

that the defendant has filed an appeal. When the plaintiff’s solicitors do this, a

helpless defendant is then compelled to apply for an extension of time to file the

Defence. Quite often, this application is met by the argument that as there is no existing

order for a stay, and the appeal does not operate as a stay, the Defence must be filed. A

registrar hearing that application then seeks to balance that argument with the prejudice

to the defendant if he is required to file his Defence notwithstanding his appeal.

Accordingly there has developed a sort of compromise order which requires the Defence to

be filed with the qualification, or undertaking from the plaintiff’s solicitors, that

the filing of the Defence will not be construed as a step in the proceedings. Sometimes

the qualification, or undertaking, is in broader terms so as to apply to all other steps

after the filing of the Defence as well, but sometimes it is not as was the situation in

the case before me. </p>
<p xmlns="">18.    I was of the view that when a plaintiff’s solicitor is aware

that a defendant has filed an appeal against the refusal to order a stay, he should not

insist on the filing of the Defence pending the hearing of the appeal. Support for this

proposition can be found in para 36 of the judgment of Karthigesu JA which I have cited in

para 12 above. I also did not think that the view expressed by Karthigesu JA is confined

to a challenge based on an absence of jurisdiction as such. It applies equally to an

application for a stay whether based on forum non conveniens or some other ground. The

very reason why a plaintiff’s solicitor does not, and should not, insist on the

filing of the Defence before the original stay application is heard is equally applicable

to an appeal i.e to require the filing of the Defence will defeat the very purpose of the

stay application, or, as the case may be, the appeal. </p>
<p xmlns="">19.    If, however, a plaintiff’s solicitor insists on the filing

of the Defence notwithstanding the appeal, then the defendant’s solicitors should

apply for an extension of time to file the Defence pending the outcome of the appeal.

Indeed, to avoid any unnecessary aggravation or concern, this is a matter that the

defendant’s solicitors should consider from the very beginning when drafting the

original stay application. In other words, the defendant’s solicitors should consider

then whether to include an alternative prayer that should the application be unsuccessful,

the defendant be granted an extension of time to, say, 14 days after the outcome of his

appeal or appeals that may be filed by him. </p>
<p xmlns="">20.    The primary prayer or the first limb of the prayer for such a

relief should be for an extension of time pending the outcome of the appeal or appeals, as

the case may be. That should not be left as an alternative prayer as was in the present

case before me. </p>
<p xmlns="">21.    Mr Arul had sought to explain away the terms of the

Defendant’s application for an extension of time by submitting that he was

approaching the matter chronologically. I did not accept such a submission. The point was

not one of chronology but one of priority i.e what was the Defendant primarily seeking.

However, he further submitted that during arguments before the Assistant Registrar he had

made it clear that what the Defendant was primarily seeking was an extension of time

pending the outcome of her appeals. </p>
<p xmlns="">22.    I was of the view that once an application for an extension of

time to file a Defence pending the outcome of an appeal is made, the extension should,

generally speaking, be granted so as not to render the appeal nugatory. </p>
<p xmlns="">23.    For various reasons, I was not in favour of the type of

compromise order that I have mentioned. </p>
<p xmlns="">24.    First, if the concern about submission to jurisdiction can be so

easily addressed by the compromise order, then there is no reason why the Defence should

not be required to be filed on the basis of a similar compromise order, or a similar

undertaking, even before the original stay application is heard. Yet, as I have mentioned,

it has been the practice not to require the Defence to be filed pending the hearing of the

original stay application. </p>
<p xmlns="">25.    Secondly, and more importantly, I was of the view that it was

illogical to require the Defence to be filed, with all the follow-up steps which will be

taken, when a defendant is exercising his right of appeal. </p>
<p xmlns="">26.    I was not persuaded by the argument, which I have heard before,

that should a defendant succeed in his appeal, the plaintiff can be ordered to pay all the

costs of the steps taken so far and hence there is no prejudice to the defendant. </p>
<p xmlns="">27.    In my view, there is prejudice to the defendant. The point is

that while a defendant is seeking to stay the proceedings, whether by way of original

application or an appeal, the defendant should not be required to meet the

plaintiff’s claim on the merits. A defendant is entitled to focus his attention on

the appeal for a stay and not be distracted by running two contradictory courses of action

at the same time. </p>
<p xmlns="">28.    Thirdly, should a defendant eventually succeed in his appeal, he

may never be required to meet the plaintiff’s claim on the merits as the plaintiff

may, for his own reasons, then decide not to pursue his claim in the alternative

jurisdiction. </p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Fourthly, until all avenues of appeal in relation to a stay

application are exhausted, our courts are not properly seized of the matter (see again

para 30 of the judgment of Karthigesu JA which I have cited in para 12 above). </p>
<p xmlns="">30.    If not for the oral request for an extension of time to file the

Defence which was acceded to and the manner in which the Defendant’s application for

an extension of time was drafted, I would have granted the Defendant an extension of time

to file her Defence until after the outcome of her appeals. However, in the light of these

factors, I ordered her to file her Defence within a certain time frame on the undertaking

of Plaintiffs’ Counsel not to treat this as a submission to the jurisdiction of the

Singapore court, but I ordered a stay of all other steps in the present action pending the

outcome of her appeals. I also made a consequential order to ensure that she did not try

to take undue advantage of her right to appeal to the Court of Appeal. If her request for

further arguments was not successful, she was to file the Notice of Appeal, if any, within

a shorter time frame than the usual period should she wish the stay order to continue to

apply. This did not mean that the time to file the Notice of Appeal was reduced. The usual

time frame remained, but if she wanted the stay order to continue to apply, she had to

decide sooner, rather than later, whether she was going to appeal to the Court of Appeal. </p>
<p xmlns="">31.    I also granted the parties liberty to apply and made other

consequential orders on costs. </p>
