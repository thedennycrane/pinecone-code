<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present dispute involves a claim by a bank
                    against a warehouseman arising from a fraud perpetrated on the bank by a
                    borrower in respect of collateral which the warehouseman had custody over. It
                    raises the question of the scope and extent of a collateral manager’s
                    duties to his principal, as well as issues of causation and
                remoteness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Singapore
                    Branch (“the Bank”), provided trade financing to a company called
                    Singapore Tin Industries Pte Ltd (“STI”), which was engaged in the
                    business of tin refining and tin trading. Pursuant to a facilities agreement
                    (“the Facilities Agreement”) dated 27 August 2007, the Bank
                    made advances to STI for the purchase of tin in various forms, such as tin
                    concentrate and crude tin ingots. These advances were secured, <em>inter alia</em>, by STI pledging the purchased tin products
                    (and refined tin ingots produced from its refinery) to the Bank as collateral.
                    The present claim revolves around a substance known as tin dross, which formed
                    part of the collateral pledged to the Bank by STI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Tin dross is a by-product of the tin refining
                    process. Crude tin is refined by being placed (in the form of ingots) into a
                    large kettle and heated above the melting point of tin to produce molten tin.
                    Certain processes are then applied causing the impurities in the molten tin to
                    rise to the surface as a solid mixture, which is then skimmed off. This solid
                    mixture of impurities is then placed into a liquation furnace and heated until
                    any excess tin in the mixture melts and is extracted to be put back into the
                    kettle. What is left is a dry form of tin dross which is then taken out of the
                    liquation furnace. Tin dross is not a homogenous substance; it can consist of
                    fine particles as well as solid lumps in various shapes and sizes. The fine
                    particles generally consist of tin oxide while the lumps consist of iron-tin
                    compounds and bits of tin metal. As is obvious from the above description, tin
                    dross contains residual amounts of tin from the refining process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The goods pledged by STI were not managed by the
                    Bank directly. Instead, STI and the Bank entered into a collateral management
                    agreement (“CMA”) dated 24 August 2007 with the defendant,
                    CWT Commodities (SEA) Pte Ltd (“CWT”), a company that provided
                    general warehousing services, to supervise the receipt, storage and release of
                    the pledged goods. CWT was previously known as C&amp;P Asia (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd
                    (“C&amp;P”) at the time of the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The CMA incorporated CWT’s standard
                    Forwarding Conditions and standard Warehousing Conditions insofar as they were
                    not inconsistent with the principal terms of the CMA. These two sets of standard
                    conditions were collectively referred to as “the FWC” in the CMA
                    and I will adopt the same term accordingly. CWT’s obligations under the
                    CMA were, <em>inter alia</em>, to issue warehouse receipts
                    (“WRs”) and certificates of quality (“CQs”) to the
                    Bank in respect of goods brought into its custody. The WRs served as an account
                    to the Bank that a certain type and quantity of goods had been received by CWT
                    to be held as the Bank’s collateral. The CQs were supposed to confirm that
                    the goods conformed to the Bank’s quality criteria in terms of having a
                    minimum tin content. For any batch of goods brought into CWT’s custody,
                    the Bank would require a WR and a CQ to be issued before it would permit STI to
                    make a drawdown under the Facilities Agreement to finance that particular batch
                    of goods. CWT was also not permitted under the CMA to release any stored goods
                    unless the Bank had issued release instructions to CWT. In consideration for its
                    services, CWT charged a monthly management fee of US$4,000 which was payable by
                    STI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For the purposes of fulfilling its obligations
                    under the CMA, CWT leased a warehouse (“the Warehouse”) from STI
                    within STI’s own premises at 61 Tuas Crescent and another warehouse
                    at 1 Tuas Avenue 3 from a related company, C&amp;P Asia (S) Pte Ltd. The latter
                    warehouse is not relevant for present purposes. CWT had sole management and
                    control of the Warehouse and STI personnel had no access to it. All goods
                    pledged by STI to the Bank were stored by CWT in the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s financing of tin dross</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During the period of the CMA, CWT issued WRs and
                    CQs in respect of goods delivered by STI into its custody. The collateral
                    received by CWT consisted of tin ingots (both refined and unrefined), tin
                    concentrate, tin slag and tin dross. With regard to tin dross in particular, CWT
                    issued WRs and CQs in respect of seven batches of tin dross pledged by STI to
                    the Bank, the details of which are set out as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For the purpose of issuing the CQs, CWT did not
                    itself analyse the tin dross. The first batch (<em>ie</em>,
                    WRC20070901363) was analysed by Singapore Test Services Pte Ltd
                    (“STS”). The first batch of tin dross had actually been pledged by
                    STI to its previous financier, the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd
                    (“DBS”) and held by CWT under a collateral management agreement
                    with DBS similar to the present CMA. Although the analysis was carried out by
                    STS, CWT issued its own CQ for DBS under its letterhead repeating the result of
                    STS’ analysis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> When the Bank took over from DBS as
                    STI’s banker, CWT issued a fresh WR to the Bank for this batch of tin
                    dross while using the same results from the original by STS to issue a fresh CQ
                    for the Bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The subsequent batches of tin dross were
                    analysed by Alex Stewart Assayers (S) Pte Ltd (“Alex Stewart”).
                    Alex Stewart would analyse samples and issue certificates of analysis indicating
                    only the percentage of tin content measured. Thereafter, CWT issued its own CQs
                    to the Bank under its letterhead repeating the results of Alex Stewart’s
                    analyses, but stating that the analyses were conducted by Alex Stewart. CWT also
                    attached the original certificates of analysis issued by Alex Stewart to its own
                    CQs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Based on the WRs and CQs issued by CWT for tin
                    dross, the Bank advanced the following sums to STI:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">STI’s fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Unfortunately for the Bank, STI had been
                    perpetrating a fraud on it. This fraud essentially consisted of the
                    round-tripping of tin dross inventory. The seven batches of tin dross stored by
                    CWT (referred to at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above) were
                    purportedly purchased by STI from third parties and sold to other third parties
                    and the Bank advanced money to STI in the belief that it was financing such
                    purchases. The Bank subsequently issued release instructions to CWT to deliver
                    the tin dross to STI, who was then supposed to deliver it to the third party
                    buyer. Out of the seven batches of tin dross, the Bank issued release
                    instructions to CWT for the first five batches. No release instructions were
                    given for the remaining two batches, <em>ie</em>,
                    WRC20080601868 and WRC20080601881. The release instructions were given on the
                    following dates:</p>

                        2008</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, apparently, no actual sale of tin
                    dross was made and the released stocks of tin dross were never physically
                    removed from the Warehouse. This was because STI chose not to take physical
                    delivery of the tin dross from CWT, but instead signed to acknowledge receipt of
                    the same and gave instructions for the same to be retained in the Warehouse. CWT
                    thus held onto the released batches of tin dross but placed them apart from the
                    collateral that was still held for the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The tin dross that was released from the
                    Bank’s security (but which physically remained in the Warehouse) was
                    subsequently combined with additional tin dross which STI delivered to the
                    Warehouse from outside to obtain an additional advance from the Bank. This
                    additional dross had been generated by STI itself from its refining process. CWT
                    would then issue a fresh WR and CQ to the Bank in respect of the combined tin
                    dross. The tin dross that was previously released (and placed apart from the
                    Bank’s remaining collateral) and the additional tin dross would then be
                    placed together with the remaining collateral. From CWT’s perspective,
                    this was done on the basis that STI had re-pledged the released batch of tin
                    dross to the Bank as fresh security together with the additional dross brought
                    into the Warehouse. The Bank did not know that the tin dross being pledged
                    included those previously released as it had thought that the released tin dross
                    had been sent to the third party buyer. It believed instead that the tin dross
                    was purchased entirely from a third party by STI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The following is an illustration of how the
                    round-tripping of tin dross worked. CWT issued a WR and CQ for 136.686 metric
                    tons of tin dross on 10 September 2007. This was the first batch of tin
                    dross stored in the Warehouse which the Bank had taken over from DBS. This batch
                    of tin dross was released for sale on 29 November 2007 and STI would have
                    signed to acknowledge receipt of the tin dross although the tin dross did not
                    leave the Warehouse physically. Subsequently, STI delivered 69.1915 metric tons
                    of tin dross to the Warehouse from its own refinery. This additional tin dross
                    was combined with the released batch of tin dross to form a new batch of tin
                    dross totalling 205.8775 metric tons. This became the second batch of tin dross
                    and CWT accordingly issued a fresh WR and CQ for it on 6 December 2007. The
                    process then repeated itself with STI adding new quantities of tin dross
                    produced from its refinery each time round. This was the reason for the
                    increasing quantity of tin dross in each subsequent batch pledged as
                    collateral.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The effect of these transactions was that the
                    Bank ended up advancing money to STI in the belief that STI’s existing
                    stocks of tin dross were being sold for value, and that it was financing the
                    purchase of new batches of tin dross. The reality was that the Bank was
                    advancing money on the security of tin dross produced entirely by STI and left
                    to accumulate in the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">STI’s default and the Bank’s attempt to realise its
                security </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     STI defaulted on its loans in early July 2008.
                    On 20 October 2008, the Bank appointed one Timothy Reid (“the
                    Receiver”), a partner of Ferrier Hodgson Pte Ltd, as receiver and manager
                    of the goods stored by CWT. STI’s fraud was subsequently uncovered through
                    the Receiver’s investigations. The Receiver then attempted to dispose of
                    the remaining tin inventory in the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Around the same time, CWT on the instructions
                    of the Bank had appointed a company called Inspectorate (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“Inspectorate”) to take samples of and analyse tin dross in the
                    Warehouse. On 17 October 2008, Inspectorate took samples to do the
                    analysis. The results from the analysis showed that the tin content in the dross
                    varied considerably and, more importantly, was lower than what was represented
                    in the CQs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On or about 28 November 2008,
                    Inspectorate took samples of tin dross to conduct a second analysis, this time
                    on the instructions of the Receiver. The results of this second analysis were
                    similar to the first in that the tin content in the drums of tin dross tested
                    was lower than what the CQs represented and contained a large degree of
                    variance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     To make matters worse, the Bank said that it
                    was not even able to sell the tin dross to recoup a part of the monies it had
                    advanced to STI because the dross was contaminated. The Receiver alleged that a
                    prospective third party buyer had offered to purchase the Bank’s stock of
                    tin dross and tin concentrate, and to dispose of the tin slag in the Warehouse,
                    for US$10,000. Apparently, the buyer was unable to offer more because the tin
                    dross contained toxic substances. The Receiver informed the Bank of this matter
                    and the Bank decided to dispose of the tin dross rather than risk a breach of
                    any environmental regulations. On or about 6 August 2009, the Receiver
                    appointed a waste management company, ECO Special Waste Management Pte Ltd
                    (“ECO”), to dispose of the tin dross and tin concentrate. Prior to
                    disposal, ECO conducted random tests on two samples of the dross. The results
                    showed that the samples tested had very low tin content and lead was also
                    detected. The Receiver understood from relevant environmental regulations that
                    once lead was detected in waste material, it was classified as toxic waste which
                    required solidification and stabilisation treatment before it could be disposed
                    of. The Receiver ended up incurring $104,860 in fees to ECO to treat and dispose
                    of the contaminated tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Bank managed to recover part of
                    STI’s overall outstanding loans by looking to its other forms of security.
                    Through the efforts of the Receiver, the Bank managed to sell the remaining
                    goods in the Warehouse (consisting of tin ingots and tin concentrate), as well
                    as STI’s premises at 61 Tuas Crescent and the machinery contained therein.
                    The Receiver also applied for and obtained a winding-up order on 17 July
                    2009 against a company called KJP International (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“KJP”), which was one of STI’s major debtors. KJP played a
                    role in the round-tripping of tin dross inventory by STI and this will be
                    elaborated on below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Bank also issued a request under a standby
                    offtake contract dated 2 October 2007 between the Bank and a Chinese
                    company called Yunnan Tin Co Ltd (“Yunnan Tin”). This standby
                    offtake contract was part of the Bank’s security under the Facilities
                    Agreement and essentially obligated Yunnan Tin to purchase, upon the
                    Bank’s request, STI’s tin inventory in such quantity and upon such
                    terms as the Bank may specify in its request. However, Yunnan Tin refused to
                    comply with the Bank’s request to purchase the tin dross (before it was
                    disposed of by the Receiver) apparently on the basis that tin dross was not
                    within the scope of the standby offtake contract. The Bank commenced arbitration
                    proceedings against Yunnan Tin on 16 April 2009. Those proceedings are
                    ongoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Lastly, the Bank called on the personal
                    guarantees given by STI’s directors pursuant to the Facilities Agreement
                    and eventually obtained bankruptcy orders against them. STI itself was wound up
                    on 18 December 2009 upon the application of the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Despite the Bank’s efforts to realise
                    its security, there was still an outstanding amount of more than US$50m. The
                    Bank accordingly brought this action against CWT in early 2009 in respect of the
                    unpaid part of its advances which was used to finance the purchase of tin dross,
                    alleging that CWT had breached its contractual obligations to the Bank or had
                    fraudulently or negligently made representations to it which caused it to
                    continue advancing money to STI based on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the security of the tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Bank’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Bank’s complaint against CWT rests
                    on two main grounds. First, CWT was contractually obliged to release tin dross
                    (when authorised by the Bank) by physically delivering the tin dross out of the
                    Warehouse to the party designated by the Bank <em>ie</em>,
                    STI. It was not to allow a notional delivery and retain tin dross in the
                    Warehouse, whether or not the tin dross was segregated from the remaining
                    collateral. Likewise, CWT was contractually obliged to accept tin dross only if
                    it was physically delivered into the Warehouse and not if the tin dross was
                    already in the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Bank further contended that it was an
                    implied term of the CMA that CWT would inform the Bank if the released tin dross
                    was not in fact delivered out of the Warehouse and also if the tin dross for
                    which WRs and CQs were issued was not in fact tin dross delivered into the
                    Warehouse, but was part of the dross retained in the Warehouse, although
                    segregated from the remaining collateral. In omitting to inform the Bank, CWT
                    had falsely represented that the released tin dross was physically delivered out
                    of the Warehouse and that tin dross for which WRs and CQs were issued was
                    physically delivered into the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Bank’s second complaint against CWT
                    was that CWT had issued false or misleading CQs which represented that the tin
                    dross in the Warehouse contained a higher percentage of tin than was actually
                    the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Bank alleged that by reason of CWT’s
                    wrongs as described above, it advanced money to STI to finance alleged purchases
                    of tin dross which it otherwise would not have done. The total outstanding
                    amount of these advances (referred to at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) is US$10,602,084. The Bank has also claimed the
                    additional $104,860 incurred in treating and disposing of the tin
                dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CWT’s defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     CWT raised a number of defences to the
                    Bank’s claim. First, it contended that tin dross was not even covered by
                    the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Secondly, even if tin dross was covered by the
                    CMA, CWT contended that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was allowed to keep released tin
                        dross in the Warehouse so long as they were segregated from the remaining
                        collateral and to issue WRs and CQs for tin dross which included those
                        retained and segregated in the Warehouse;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was under no duty to inform the Bank that
                        released tin dross was not physically delivered out of the Warehouse or that
                        tin dross for which WRs and CQs were issued included those retained and
                        segregated in the Warehouse; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     it assumed no responsibility for the analyses for tin
                        dross which were carried out by Alex Stewart; and, in any event, the Bank
                        did not establish that the level of tin stated in such analyses was
                        incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Thirdly, CWT contended that even if it had
                    breached the CMA or its duty of care to the Bank, the Bank’s loss was not
                    caused by such breach, but rather by its own failure to properly assess the
                    creditworthiness of STI and to note red flags in the course of its dealing with
                    STI. Fourthly, the loss suffered by the Bank was too remote in any
                event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     CWT was also relying on a number of exclusion
                    and limitation clauses contained in the CMA. It has since abandoned its reliance
                    on these clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Finally, CWT is also counterclaiming against
                    the Bank for the sum of US$8,000 as two months’ outstanding management
                    fees under the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether tin dross was covered by the CMA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CWT’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Counsel for CWT, Mr Kenneth Tan, submitted
                    that tin dross was not covered by the CMA. The term “Goods” was
                    defined in Clause 1.1 of the CMA to mean “all tin ingots (whether in the
                    form of SN or SN+) and work in progress from time to time delivered to C&amp;P
                    by or on behalf of BORROWER”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> SN and SN+ were in turn defined to mean
                    unrefined raw material and refined tin ingots of London Metal Exchange
                    (“LME”) grade respectively, while “Work In Progress”
                    was defined as “the period in which and process of, the Goods being
                    converted from SN to SN+”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan thus argued that
                    “Goods” under the CMA referred to tin ingots, whether they were
                    being stored in the Warehouse or in the process of being refined. Tin dross, as
                    a by-product of the refining process, could not conceivably be work in progress
                    as it cannot be put back into the refinery to obtain refined tin of LME grade.
                    Thus, CWT’s obligations to the Bank in relation to tin dross were governed
                    instead by the FWC referred to at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above.
                    There were therefore two separate regimes. The first was for tin ingots and
                    Clauses 1 to 17 of the CMA (<em>ie</em>, all the
                    clauses of the CMA) applied to that. The second regime was for tin dross, for
                    which none of the clauses in the CMA applied and only the FWC
                applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Mr Tan supported his argument by pointing out
                    that Appendix IV of the CMA expressly set out a process for CWT to conduct
                    analyses on samples of tin ingots under its custody using an instrument called
                    an ARC/Spark Optical Emission Spectrometer for the purposes of issuing CQs for
                    tin ingots.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the CMA
                    did not stipulate any process for the analysis of tin dross and the ARC/Spark
                    Optical Emission Spectrometer used to analyse tin ingots was not suitable for
                    analysing tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Tan also sought to rely on
                    Clauses 16.5 and 16.6 of the CMA which stated that any waiver or amendment
                    (respectively) of the CMA would only be effective if it was made in
                        writing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> As there was
                    neither a waiver nor an amendment, the Bank could not contend now that tin dross
                    was covered by the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Counsel for the Bank, Mr Herman Jeremiah,
                    submitted on the other hand that tin dross was covered under the CMA because it
                    could be classified as either work in progress forming part of the
                    “Goods” under Clause 1.1 of the CMA, or tin concentrate which
                    was undefined. Mr Jeremiah pointed out that the phrase “work in
                    progress” in the definition of “Goods” was not capitalised
                    and should not be taken to refer to “Work In Progress” which was
                    defined elsewhere in Clause 1.1 to refer to a period of time instead of
                    physical goods. Mr Jeremiah thus argued that tin dross could constitute
                    work in progress because it was a product that had not reached its end stage and
                    could be further treated to extract its tin content.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Jeremiah submitted in the alternative
                    that tin dross could be considered as a form of tin concentrate. As tin
                    concentrate was not defined in the CMA, Mr Jeremiah contended that it should be
                    taken to refer to anything containing a high percentage of tin. This
                    interpretation was supported by the evidence of one of the Bank’s
                    witnesses, Clement Tan, who was a relationship manager of the Bank and who was
                    part of the Bank’s deal team in the negotiations leading to the Facilities
                    Agreement and CMA. Clement Tan testified that when these agreements were
                    negotiated, no one had an expert knowledge of tin products and the Bank’s
                    paramount concern at the time in relation to the collateral pledged by STI was
                    whether it contained a high level of tin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Thus, the Bank had not intended to restrict
                    the scope of the Facilities Agreement and CMA to limited, specific types of tin
                    products only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Mr Jeremiah lastly submitted that in any
                    event, CWT was estopped by convention from denying that tin dross was covered by
                    the CMA because both it and the Bank had always acted under such an assumption.
                    Clause 5.6 of the CMA stated that CWT shall not issue WRs in respect of
                    “Goods” that did not conform to the Bank’s quality
                        criteria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Since
                    CWT had issued WRs in respect of tin dross, it must have regarded tin dross as
                    falling within the scope of the CMA. The same reasoning applied when CWT issued
                    CQs in respect of tin dross as there was no requirement for CQs to be issued if
                    only the FWC applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Mr Jeremiah also pointed out that CWT had
                    originally conceded in its pleadings that tin dross was treated by the parties
                    as being covered under the CMA. In its Defence and Counterclaim filed on
                    15 June 2009, CWT stated at para 7:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Claim is admitted to the extent that
                        Tin Dross was also treated by the parties as being covered under the CMA,
                        save that the Quality Certificates to be issued in respect of the Tin Dross
                        under the CMA were based on quality analyses carried out by Messrs Alex
                        Stewart Assayers (S) Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was only from 9 June 2010 when CWT filed its Defence and
                    Counterclaim (Amendment No 3) that it took the position, for the first
                    time, that tin dross was not covered by the CMA. Mr Jeremiah thus contended that
                    CWT’s change in position was a clear afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I am of the view that it is not necessary for
                    me to rule whether, as a matter of contractual interpretation, tin dross fell
                    within the scope of the CMA. The evidence shows quite clearly that both the Bank
                    and CWT had operated on the assumption that it did. In coming to this finding, I
                    took the following factors into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, there was only one regime under the
                    CMA. Goods either came within the CMA or they did not. The recitals to the CMA
                    referred only to “the Goods” as defined therein. If a particular
                    type of goods came within the CMA, then the CMA applied together with the FWC
                    except to the extent of any inconsistency between the two documents, in which
                    case the terms of the CMA prevailed. The FWC was part of the CMA and did not
                    apply separately and independently of the CMA as Mr Tan had
                submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Secondly, while the FWC might also suggest the
                    issuance of WRs, there was no requirement thereunder for the issuance of CQs. I
                    agree with Mr Jeremiah that there was no reason for CWT to issue CQs for tin
                    dross unless it had regarded tin dross as falling under the CMA. Mr Tan argued
                    that although CWT had no obligation to issue CQs for tin dross if it was not
                    covered by the CMA, CWT was not precluded from doing so. In other words, CWT
                    could do more than it was obligated to do. However, this really begs the
                    question why CWT bothered to issue CQs for tin dross (which also involved
                    obtaining analyses from Alex Stewart) in the first place. Although CWT’s
                    director and main witness, Glen Creighton (“Creighton”) testified
                    in cross-examination that CWT issued CQs for tin dross to the Bank at
                    STI’s request,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> he did not explain why STI would
                    have made such a request if tin dross was not covered by the CMA. He also did
                    not explain why CWT issued CQs for tin dross under its own letterhead instead of
                    simply forwarding the original certificates of analysis by Alex Stewart to the
                    Bank, if he believed that tin dross was not covered by the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This brings me to a third point: tin dross was
                    not even supposed to be stored in the Warehouse if it was not covered by the
                    CMA. Clause 9.2 of the CMA provided that STI “shall not allow or
                    attempt to store or place any other goods in the Warehouse Facilities without
                    the prior written consent of ABN AMRO and C&amp;P.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As will be seen below,
                    Creighton was fully aware of this provision. At no time did he consider STI to
                    be in breach of it when tin dross was stored in the Warehouse. I have already
                    rejected Mr Tan’s submission that there were two regimes, one of
                    which was purportedly separate from the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, I come to arguably the most damning
                    evidence against CWT on this point. I agree with Mr Jeremiah that the initial
                    position taken by CWT in its pleadings was further evidence that the parties had
                    acted on the basis that tin dross was covered by the CMA. Creighton claimed in
                    cross-examination that CWT had actually clarified instead of changed its
                    position when it amended its Defence and Counterclaim in 9 June 2010 to
                    contend that tin dross was not covered by the CMA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I do not accept his evidence
                    because it is clear that CWT had made a complete U-turn in its defence.
                    Creighton’s evidence about clarification reflected poorly on his
                    credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The law on estoppel by convention is settled.
                    In <em>Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee
                        Augustine</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 (“<em>Travista Development</em>”), the Court of Appeal held at [31]
                    that the following elements must be present to found an estoppel by
                    convention:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The parties must have acted on an
                        assumed and incorrect state of fact or law in their course or
                        dealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        assumption must be either shared by both parties pursuant to an agreement or
                        something akin to an agreement, or made by one party and acquiesced to by
                        the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     It
                        must be unjust or unconscionable to allow the parties (or one of them) to go
                        back on that assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As regards the first element, I do not read
                    the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <em>Travista
                        Development</em> as laying down a rule that the party seeking to
                    invoke the estoppel also has to <em>prove</em> that the
                    assumed state of fact or law is incorrect. The doctrine of estoppel by
                    convention operates to preclude a party from denying the truth of an assumed
                    state of affairs if it would be unjust or unconscionable to allow him to go back
                    on it: <em>Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable
                        Vision Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 195 at [28]. Although the assumed
                    state of affairs would usually turn out to be incorrect in most cases, the
                    actual veracity or falsity of the assumption is irrelevant because the estopped
                    party is simply barred from putting it in issue. The parties’ rights are
                    regulated “not by the real state of facts, but by that conventional state
                    of facts which the two parties agree to make the basis of their action”:
                    per Lord Blackburn in <em>Burkinshaw v Nicolls</em>
                    (1878) 3 App Cas 1004 at 1026. There is thus no need for the Bank to prove
                    that the assumption in this case was false in order to invoke estoppel by
                    convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On the facts, both CWT and the Bank had acted
                    on the basis that tin dross fell within the CMA and this assumption was shared
                    by both parties pursuant to the CMA. It would be unjust in the circumstances to
                    allow CWT to go back on this assumption because it knew that the Bank would be
                    acting on the basis that tin dross came within the CMA and advance money on the
                    security of the tin dross even though CWT was not aware of the exact details of
                    the financing arrangement between the Bank and STI. Thus, CWT is estopped from
                    contending that tin dross did not fall under the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I also reject Mr Tan’s reliance on
                    Clauses 16.5 and 16.6 of the CMA. The parties had assumed that tin dross
                    was covered by the CMA and thus the question of waiver or amendment did not
                    arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether CWT was under a duty to inform the Bank that tin dross was
                not physically leaving and entering the Warehouse and whether it had breached that
                duty</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Jeremiah submitted that CWT was
                    obligated under the CMA to ensure that batches of tin dross released pursuant to
                    the Bank’s release instructions were physically delivered out of the
                    Warehouse. CWT was also obligated not to issue any WRs or CQs for new batches of
                    tin dross that were not physically received into the Warehouse from outside. In
                    this regard, Mr Jeremiah relied on Clauses 5.3 and 6.5 of the CMA.
                    Clause 5.3 stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">C&amp;P represents and warrants that any Warehouse Receipts issued by

                        accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Clause 6.5 of the CMA stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    C&amp;P shall at all times ensure that releases

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    In the case of Goods released for the purpose of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Jeremiah also relied on Clause 9.2 of
                    the CMA which, as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>,
                    stipulated that STI shall not allow or attempt to store or place any other goods
                    in the Warehouse without the prior written consent of the Bank and CWT. He
                    submitted that Clause 9.2 precluded the storage of released tin dross with
                    remaining tin dross still held as the Bank’s collateral.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     By reason of the above obligations,
                    Mr Jeremiah submitted that it was an implied term of the CMA that CWT would
                    inform the Bank if these physical movements were not taking place. This was
                    because such an implied term was necessary to give business efficacy to the
                    CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Jeremiah further relied on two of
                    CWT’s own documents to support the implication of such a term. First,
                    CWT’s manual of standard operating procedures stated at
                        Clause 8.01:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If goods have been released and signed for, but have not physically left
                        the warehouse, we are still technically responsible for their care and
                        protection. In such cases, domestic HQ must issue a separate daily report
                        showing details of released goods still in warehouse. This in turn must be
                        forward by Back Office Singapore to the financing bank, until such time as
                        the goods actually leave the warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Creighton admitted in cross-examination that these guidelines
                    represented best practices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Secondly, there was a page from CWT’s
                    website promoting its expertise in collateral management services for banks and
                    financial institutions involved in trade finance. The website stated, <em>inter alia</em>, that CWT “provides banks and clients
                    with an impartial and professional service in support of international
                        trade”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and
                    contained a diagram illustrating CWT’s involvement as the collateral
                    manager in a typical trade financing arrangement. This diagram showed that goods
                    which were the subject of trade finance would be delivered from CWT to a third
                    party buyer. The third party buyer pays the trader for the goods, and the trader
                    in turn repays the financing bank. Creighton admitted in cross-examination that
                    he was familiar with this diagram.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Mr Jeremiah
                    submitted that CWT was thus aware that there had to be movement of goods in a
                    trade financing arrangement in order for the financing bank to be
                paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Jeremiah concluded that since CWT did
                    not inform the Bank that tin dross was not physically leaving and entering the
                    Warehouse, it had breached the implied term of the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CWT’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Tan submitted that when
                    Clause 5.3 of the CMA was read in context and in accordance with commercial
                    intent, CWT would have “actually received” tin dross when it took
                    the tin dross into its custody, whether the tin dross came from outside the
                    Warehouse or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As for CWT’s obligation in releasing tin
                    dross, Mr Tan relied on Clause 6.4 of the CMA which
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">C&amp;P shall have no responsibility or liability towards BORROWER, ABN
                        AMRO or any other party for the Goods after they have been properly released
                        from the Warehouse Facilities in accordance with ABN AMRO’s Release
                        Instructions and signed for by BORROWER.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Due to a drafting error, there were actually two Clauses 6.4 in the
                    CMA. Mr Tan was referring to the first Clause 6.4. Mr Tan argued
                    that since STI had already signed to acknowledge receipt of the tin dross from
                    CWT, the dross was considered to be properly released to STI and there was no
                    further obligation on CWT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Tan thus concluded that CWT’s
                    duties to the Bank only related to keeping intact the tin dross held by it as
                    collateral for the Bank, and that such duties ceased once the Bank had issued
                    release instructions for the dross and STI signed to acknowledge receipt of the
                    same. If STI subsequently chose to re-pledge the released tin dross as fresh
                    collateral, that was its prerogative. CWT’s role was that of a mere
                    warehouseman and it was not privy to the financial arrangement between STI and
                    the Bank, or the commercial transactions between STI and third parties. It was
                    therefore not CWT’s responsibility to enquire further if tin dross which
                    had been released to STI for the purposes of sale to third parties was instead
                    re-presented as fresh collateral.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Tan further pointed out that CWT had to
                    deliver the tin dross to STI at the same premises used by both parties
                        (<em>ie</em>, 61 Tuas Crescent). It therefore made
                    little difference if the released tin dross had been physically moved out of the
                    Warehouse for a few metres and brought back in later. Creighton testified in his
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that it was not unusual
                    for STI to experience delays in the physical collection of released goods and it
                    was practical in such situations that CWT allowed STI to keep the released tin
                    dross in the Warehouse until physical collection was required.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Similarly with regard to batches of tin dross
                    being pledged or re-pledged, Mr Tan submitted that there was also no
                    requirement for such goods to be physically received from outside the Warehouse
                    before CWT could issue WRs and CQs. As long as the goods did not already form
                    part of the existing stock of collateral, CWT could receive it. Mr Tan
                    argued that because there was no obligation on CWT to ensure that tin dross was
                    physically leaving and entering the Warehouse, it would therefore have no duty
                    to inform the Bank that any dross which was released had in fact remained in the
                    Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Finally, Mr Tan sought to rely on
                    Clause 9.1 of the CMA which stipulated that CWT was to demarcate and
                    designate a separate area in the Workshop for storage of “the Goods
                        exclusively”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He
                    argued that this meant that CWT could store released tin dross in a different
                    part of the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As for Clause 9.2 of the CMA, Mr Tan
                    suggested in his opening statement that it imposed an obligation on STI but not
                    CWT not to store other tin dross with tin dross still held as
                collateral.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I am of the view that when Clauses 5.3
                    and 6.5 are read together, it is clear that they related to the physical
                    movement of pledged goods into and out of the Warehouse. Indeed, the words used
                    in Clause 5.3 are “actually received into”. In my view this
                    means physical receipt of goods into the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The reference in Clause 6.5(c) that
                    released goods shall be “delivered out” of the Warehouse was also
                    self-explanatory. It clearly referred to physical delivery out of the Warehouse.
                    Significantly, Mr Tan did not suggest any other meaning but he sought to
                    avoid Clause 6.5(c) by relying on Clause 6.4 as I mentioned above. In
                    my view, Clause 6.4 did not assist CWT because it proceeded on the premise
                    that goods have been “properly released”. There was no elaboration
                    on what that phrase meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Indeed, it appears that CWT itself initially
                    acted on the basis that released goods which were not physically delivered out
                    of the Warehouse would still be regarded as part of the Bank’s collateral.
                    In January 2008, the Bank’s officer Frank Egberts
                    (“Egberts”), who was at the material time in charge of approving
                    STI’s requests for drawdowns under the Facilities Agreement, asked CWT why
                    goods that had been released by the Bank were still reflected in CWT’s
                    weekly reports as remaining in the Warehouse. CWT’s officer, one Debby
                    Subramaniam, replied in an email dated 25 January 2008 as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Frank,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regards to your queries below, we’ve received &amp;
                        acknowledged the authorized releases for WRC20071202299 on various dates.
                        The release authorisations were then emailed to our colleagues situated at
                        STI premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>However, as the goods are still physically in our
                            warehouse, we do not deduct the stocks from our system. Thus,
                            you’ll still be able to see the balance quantity in our weekly
                            stock report</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            ensure the accuracy of goods being released out of the
                            warehouse</em>. Therefore, the Date Out column in the stock
                        movement report shows the actual release date being appended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     A draft of the above reply had been reviewed
                    by Creighton before it was sent to Egberts. Creighton sought to explain during
                    the trial that what Debby Subramaniam meant was that it was only if the goods
                    had not been <em>signed for</em> by STI that they would
                    still be regarded as part of the Bank’s collateral.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> However, it is
                    clear to me that that was not what Debby Subramaniam was saying. Creighton was
                    again not being truthful. In my view CWT had initially acted on a certain basis
                        <em>i.e</em>. that it would still record goods
                    remaining in the Warehouse as part of the Bank’s collateral even if they
                    had been signed for by STI after the Bank had issued release instructions to
                    CWT. Presumably, CWT changed this practice some time later so that the goods
                    were no longer recorded as part of the Bank’s collateral once STI had
                    signed for them, but apparently, the Bank was not notified of the
                change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, they must be
                    considered together. The duty to demarcate and designate a separate area for
                    storage of goods used as collateral must be read together with the duty not to
                    commingle them with other goods. I accept that it might have been arguable that
                    the reference to “other goods” in Clause 9.2 meant other
                    types of goods <em>eg</em>, copper as opposed to tin, but
                    that was not Mr Tan’s argument. He accepted that the reference to
                    “other goods” in Clause 9.2 referred to released tin dross as
                    well (if tin dross came within the CMA).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> His argument instead was that
                    Clause 9.2 imposed an obligation on STI only. In my view that cannot be
                    right. If STI was precluded from storing released tin dross in the Warehouse
                    then it must follow that CWT could not allow released tin dross to be retained
                    in the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Although Creighton said in cross-examination
                    that the provision in Clause 9.2 against commingling would only arise if
                    there was a threat of the Bank’s goods being contaminated or
                        compromised,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> his testimony was contradicted by
                    an email which he himself had written. In an email dated 14 November 2008
                    to CWT’s operations assistants in charge of the Warehouse, Anson Yip and
                    Devan Subramaniam, Creighton wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although <em>this would technically constitute commingling

                    17 November 2008 to the Bank’s officers Tjeerd Buurma and Clement
                    Tan, where Creighton wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Tjeerd and/or Clement,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just for the sake of good order, can you please acknowledge and confirm
                        acceptance of commingling status.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I inspected the cargo on Friday afternoon and can assure you that it is
                        clearly segregated from other Bank financed material and, stored in separate
                        identifiable lots.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The above email clearly showed that Creighton
                    regarded the placing of other goods in the Warehouse to be in breach of
                    Clause 9.2 of the CMA, notwithstanding that such goods were segregated from
                    the Bank’s collateral and there was no risk of physical commingling or
                    contamination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In my view, it is clear from Clauses 5.3,
                    6.5(c) and 9.2 of the CMA that CWT was to physically deliver tin dross out of
                    the Warehouse after its release by the Bank, and to issue WRs and CQs only in
                    respect of tin dross physically received into the Warehouse. I am also of the
                    view that such an obligation was mandated not only by a plain reading of the
                    above clauses, but by a contextual interpretation of the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It must be remembered that the CMA was not an
                    ordinary warehousing contract for the storage of goods, but a contract for the
                    storage and management of goods as part of a trade finance arrangement. In such
                    arrangements, the financing bank pays for goods which the borrower purchases
                    from a third party seller and then pledges to the bank as security. When the
                    borrower sells the goods to another third party, the bank will release the goods
                    from its custody and get repaid when the third party buyer pays the
                    borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In other words, goods pledged in the context
                    of a trade finance arrangement should not be physically remaining in the custody
                    of the financing bank or its collateral manager once they are released by the
                    bank. Similarly, goods which the bank decides to finance should not be coming
                    from goods physically within the bank’s or its collateral manager’s
                    custody since they are supposed to have been purchased from a third party. This
                    was something CWT must have known generally (even if it did not know the exact
                    details of the financing arrangement between STI and the Bank), as was evidenced
                    by the diagram displayed on its website (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). In addition, CWT’s own manual of standard
                    operating procedures directed CWT to inform the financing bank if released goods
                    did not physically leave its warehouse (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I am of the view, from a plain and contextual
                    reading of the provisions of the CMA that there was an implied term for CWT to
                    inform the Bank if tin dross was not physically leaving and entering the
                    Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The law governing the implication of terms
                    into a contract was comprehensively stated in <em>Forefront
                        Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 927, where Andrew Phang Boon Leong J held that a term would be
                    implied into a contract in fact if it passed the complementary “business
                    efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests. In reviewing the
                    authorities, Phang J cited with approval the following passage from
                    Scrutton LJ’s judgment in <em>Reigate v Union
                        Manufacturing Company (Ramsbottom), Limited and Elton Copdyeing Company,
                        Limited</em> [1918] 1 KB 592 at 605:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to
                        give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is such a term that it can
                        confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated
                        some one had said to the parties, “what will happen in such a
                        case,” they would both have replied, “Of course, so and so
                        will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear.” Unless
                        the Court comes to such conclusion as that, it ought not to imply a term
                        which the parties themselves have not expressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In my judgment, it was necessary for the
                    efficacy of the CMA to imply a term that CWT would inform the Bank if the
                    pledged goods including tin dross were not physically leaving and entering the
                    Warehouse after they were released by the Bank and re-pledged by STI
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I should mention another point. Email between
                    Creighton and CWT’s staff indicated that the danger of double financing
                    was brought to Creighton’s attention but he was of the view that STI was
                    not engaged in double financing but repeat financing and he saw nothing wrong
                    with the latter. In other words, STI was not obtaining financing from two
                    lenders at the same time on the same batch of goods, <em>ie</em>, double financing. It had obtained the Bank’s release
                    of one batch of goods which was used (with an additional quantity) to obtain
                    financing again, <em>ie</em>, repeat financing. In his
                    view, there was nothing wrong with STI obtaining repeat financing if the Bank
                    was prepared to release the goods from its collateral and then advance money on
                    the same goods again. While there is some merit in Creighton’s view, it is
                    important to note that the Bank was not aware that it was advancing money on the
                    same batch of goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is also important to remember that each
                    time the Bank released its collateral it was for the purpose of allowing that
                    batch of goods to be delivered to a purchaser thereof. In other words, the Bank
                    believed that the tin dross could be sold and was being sold to third party
                    purchasers. CWT must have known that much because although the Bank’s
                    release instructions to CWT designated STI as the receiving party, the name of
                    the third party purchaser was usually also mentioned therein. It seemed to me
                    that Creighton had overlooked these facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     So even if CWT did not know that the Bank had
                    believed that STI was purchasing the tin dross initially, CWT knew, at the
                    least, that the Bank was acting on the basis that the released tin dross was
                    being sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As for Mr Tan’s argument that there
                    would not have been much practical difference if the tin dross had been
                    delivered out of the Warehouse after their release by the Bank, and then brought
                    back in again by STI when they were re-pledged as fresh collateral, this was a
                    separate point that was not relevant here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     If the released tin dross had been physically
                    delivered out of the Warehouse to STI and if CWT knew that STI was using it as
                    fresh collateral by re-delivering it to the Warehouse, it is arguable whether
                    CWT would still be under a duty to inform the Bank that the tin dross was not in
                    fact delivered to a third party buyer. However, this question did not arise on
                    the facts before me. I am satisfied that CWT was in breach of the implied
                    provision in the CMA requiring it to inform the Bank if tin dross was not
                    physically leaving or entering the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether CWT had assumed responsibility for the analyses of tin dross
                conducted by Alex Stewart</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Bank’s second complaint against CWT
                    relates to the CQs the latter issued in respect of tin dross. As shown from the
                    table above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>, the CQs represented the
                    tin dross to be of a generally high tin content, with 81.96% being the lowest
                    and 94% being the highest. The Bank contended that in reality, the tin content
                    found in the dross was much lower and varied significantly. CWT had thus
                    breached the CMA by issuing false or misleading CQs for tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CWT’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr Tan submitted that even if tin dross was
                    covered by the CMA, CWT should not be responsible for the analyses of tin dross
                    for the second and subsequent batches for which the analyses were conducted by
                    Alex Stewart.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Creighton had testified in his AEIC that CWT
                    had no expertise in analysing tin dross.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> That was why the
                    tin dross was analysed by another party. In this regard, Mr Tan relied on
                    Clause 6.3 of CWT’s standard Warehousing Conditions which formed part
                    of the FWC. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company [meaning CWT] shall not act as an expert in relation to the
                        nature or quality of the Goods and shall not be required or be obliged to
                        provide any notification to any party whatsoever in relation to the state,
                        nature or quality of the Goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Creighton also said that because CWT was not
                    assuming responsibility for the analyses done by Alex Stewart, CWT had varied
                    the content of the CQs it issued for tin dross from the sample CQ found in
                    Appendix III of the CMA which was a sample CQ for tin ingots. The sample CQ
                    contained the following two sentences:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This certificate reflects our findings at time and place of analysis. We
                        confirm that the tin ingots sampled comply with ABN AMRO Bank N.V.,

                        Management Agreement dated <u>_______</u> between
                        Singapore Tin Industries Pte. Ltd., ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Singapore Branch and
                        C &amp; P Asia (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In contrast, the CQs issued by CWT in respect
                    of tin dross analysed by Alex Stewart did not contain the sentences reproduced
                    in the above paragraph. Instead, each CQ stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>

                        of Analysis attached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Egberts testified for the Bank in
                    cross-examination that he noticed that the sentences referred to (at <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above) were not included in the CQ issued by
                    CWT for tin dross, but acted on the basis that it was still a CQ required of and
                    issued by CWT under the CMA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The basic format of each CQ for
                    tin dross was similar to that provided in the sample CQ in Appendix III of the
                    CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Mr Jeremiah relied on the following to
                    support his submission that CWT was responsible for the results of the analysis
                    of tin dross by Alex Stewart:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     the CQs were issued on CWT’s
                        letterhead;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     each CQ mentioned the WR which it related to;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_c"></a>(c)     each CQ mentioned the percentage of the tin
                        content in the tin dross which was the subject matter of the WR referred to
                        in the CQ;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        CQs resembled the format of the sample CQ prescribed in Appendix III of the
                        CMA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        CQs were signed by a director of CWT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Mr Jeremiah also submitted that the fact
                    that Alex Stewart was used was not unusual as Clause 3.1 of the CMA
                    provided that CWT “may render the services described in this Agreement
                    through its agent, but, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the FWC,
                    shall at all times remain wholly responsible for the due performance of its
                    obligations and liabilities under this Agreement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Clause 6.3 of the Warehousing Conditions
                    (see <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above) was subject to the
                    provisions of the CMA. CWT and the Bank had acted on the basis that under the
                    CMA, CWT was supposed to issue CQs for tin dross and accept responsibility for
                    their contents. Under Clause 3.1 of the CMA (see <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> above), CWT could perform its obligations through another
                    party but would remain liable for the same. Indeed, CWT accepted that it was
                    responsible for the analysis for the first batch of tin dross carried out by
                    STS. I am of the view that the mere fact that the analysis was done by a third
                    party was neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As for the argument that CWT’s CQs based
                    on the analyses by Alex Stewart did not contain the said two sentences in the
                    sample CQ, I note that CWT’s CQs based on the analysis by STS also did not
                    contain the second of the said two sentences, <em>ie</em>,
                    the sentence confirming that the tin dross complied with the Bank’s
                    minimum quality criteria. Yet, CWT agreed that it had accepted responsibility
                    for the CQs it had issued based on STS’ analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     So, CWT’s CQs based on STS’
                    analysis did contain the first of the said two sentences “This
                    certificate reflects our findings at time and place of analysis” whereas
                    CWT’s CQs based on Alex Stewart’s analyses did not. Did this
                    difference mean that CWT did not accept responsibility for Alex Stewart’s
                    analyses?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In my view, CWT was trying to have its cake
                    and eat it. On the one hand, it did not want to be responsible for the analyses
                    done by Alex Stewart but, on the other hand, it did not want to tell the Bank
                    this openly. It knew that under the CMA, a CQ had to be issued by it for each WR
                    it issued. If an analysis was done by a third party, CWT must have known that it
                    had to adopt the analysis otherwise the Bank would not accept the tin dross, for
                    which the analysis was made, as collateral. So, CWT issued CQs under its own
                    letterhead but, as mentioned, it deleted the said two sentences from the CQs
                    which were based on Alex Stewart’s analyses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In my view, if CWT did not wish to accept
                    responsibility for such analyses, it should not have issued CQs on its
                    letterhead which repeated the results of the analyses. Indeed, Mr Tan had some
                    difficulty explaining why it did so, if not to adopt responsibility for the
                    analyses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I therefore find that CWT was responsible for
                    the contents of the CQs it issued for tin dross, notwithstanding that the
                    analyses were carried out by Alex Stewart.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the CQs were false or misleading</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Although CWT was responsible for the CQs it
                    issued for tin dross, the burden still lies on the Bank to establish that the
                    substance of the CQs was false or misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Neither side called Alex Stewart to give
                    evidence. As stated earlier (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above), the
                    quality analyses conducted by Inspectorate and ECO suggested that the tin
                    content in the dross was actually very low and varied
                considerably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     However, as regards the second analysis by
                    Inspectorate, there was a question as to whether samples were taken from the
                    relevant drums of tin dross or not. Hence the Bank no longer relied on that
                    analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As for the first analysis by Inspectorate and
                    the one by ECO, according to the evidence of CWT’s expert witness, Choong
                    Phak Leng (“Choong”), there was a certain method to ensure that
                    the taking of samples of tin dross was accurately done. This was because tin
                    dross is not a homogenous substance (as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>). However, apparently, that was not the method
                    used to take samples of the tin dross for analysis by Inspectorate and by ECO.
                    This meant that the results from the analyses by Inspectorate and ECO themselves
                    were unreliable. As such, the Bank did not place much reliance on these results
                    in its closing submissions. Instead, it contended that it was mathematically
                    impossible for the tin dross in the Warehouse to have an average tin content of
                    more than 80%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Mr Jeremiah’s mathematical
                    argument was founded on Clause 4 of Appendix I to the CMA, which
                    stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the limits and conditions set out in clause 6 of the

                        (minimum 99.90% tin content). BORROWER shall ensure that for every one

                        process. ... C&amp;P shall also promptly notify ABN AMRO in the event that
                        the quantity of SN released for processing is not returned to C&amp;P as SN+
                        within a reasonable time or if the quantity of SN+ returned is less than
                        that to be returned in accordance with ABN AMRO’s conversion
                        formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Mr Jeremiah explained Clause 4 of
                    Appendix I to mean that the Bank and STI had agreed on a conversion formula
                    stipulating that for every one ton of crude tin released to STI for purposes of
                    refining, STI would return 0.9985 tons of refined tin back to the Bank’s
                    custody and CWT was to notify the Bank if this formula was not adhered to. Since
                    Creighton confirmed in cross-examination that CWT had never once informed the
                    Bank that the formula was not observed,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Mr Jeremiah
                    submitted that it had been adhered to. Mr Jeremiah therefore submitted that
                    nearly all the tin content in the crude tin released for refining was converted
                    into refined tin, which implied that the actual amount of tin lost through the
                    refining process and found in the tin dross was extremely small. Since it is not
                    disputed that all the tin dross in the Warehouse in fact came from STI’s
                    refinery and not from outside sources, it was mathematically impossible for the
                    dross to contain 80% or more tin content if the formula agreed on between the
                    parties was adhered to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The difficulty with this line of argument is
                    that it assumed that the formula agreed on by the parties was in fact observed.
                    Although Creighton was not aware of any notification by CWT to the Bank that the
                    formula had not been observed, it is not clear if he was even the person who was
                    checking to ensure that the formula was observed. What the formula demanded, in
                    essence, was a near-perfect rate of conversion of crude tin into refined tin
                    which might well depend on the quality of the crude tin ingots and the
                    efficiency of STI’s refining process on which no evidence was
                    given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Mr Jeremiah also attempted to rely on an
                    admission given by Choong at the end of cross-examination in which he appeared
                    to agree that if crude tin ingots of 99.85% tin content were put into the
                    refinery, then the tin content in the tin dross which came out of the refining
                    process was going to be much, much less.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, Choong’s answer
                    must be seen in the context of his entire cross-examination. Mr Jeremiah had
                    earlier asked Choong to make three assumptions: (1) that STI had a state of
                    the art refinery; (2) that the formula given was workable; and
                    (3) that CWT had not notified the Bank that the formula had been deviated
                        from.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> It was on these assumptions that
                    Mr Jeremiah asked Choong at the end of cross-examination whether refining
                    crude tin of 99.85% tin content would end up producing tin dross of low tin
                    content and Choong agreed. This admission does not assist the Bank’s case
                    because it has failed to produce any real evidence to show that the assumptions,
                    which its mathematical calculations were based on, were correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The problem for the Bank was that it was
                    initially relying on the results from Inspectorate and ECO to prove that the CQs
                    issued for tin dross were inaccurate. When it appeared that these results were
                    not reliable, the Bank then switched tactics and sought to rely on the
                    mathematical formula. Except for Creighton’s evidence that he was not
                    aware of any notification from CWT to the Bank that the formula had not been
                    observed, there was no other evidence on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I will briefly address
                    Mr Jeremiah’s remaining arguments on this issue. First,
                    Mr Jeremiah submitted that CWT had misrepresented the tin content in the
                    tin dross in the CQs simply by mentioning a single percentage figure for each
                    batch of tin dross, whereas CWT had admitted in its own pleadings and through
                    Choong that tin dross is not uniform and that the tin content in dross is likely
                    to vary from drum to drum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    However, I find that the Bank’s
                    concern related more to the allegedly low tin content of the tin dross rather
                    than the fact that the tin content was not uniform. If the average tin content
                    was not lower than that stated in each CQ, the Bank would not be
                    complaining.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Jeremiah also pointed out that the
                    samples of tin dross given to Alex Stewart for analyses were taken by
                    STI’s and not CWT’s staff. While this may suggest a lax attitude by
                    CWT, it was actually irrelevant because neither side relied on the analyses by
                    Alex Stewart for the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Mr Jeremiah also submitted that the
                    fact that the Receiver was offered only US$10,000 for the entire stock of tin
                    dross and tin concentrate, and to dispose of the tin slag, was evidence that the
                    tin content in the dross was very low. I cannot accept this submission. I have
                    noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above) that the
                    prospective buyer of the tin dross had apparently informed the Receiver that it
                    was unable to offer a higher price because the dross was contaminated with toxic
                    substances, not because the tin dross had a low tin content. By the way, it was
                    also not clear how the buyer had concluded that the dross was contaminated with
                    toxic substances, and why and how and when this contamination had
                    accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As for the analysis conducted by ECO (see
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above), aside from the fact that it
                    had not used the correct method to take samples of tin dross, there was also no
                    elaboration as to whether lead is necessarily or frequently found in tin dross,
                    and whether only a certain amount of lead would lead to a conclusion that the
                    tin dross is contaminated. There was also no elaboration as to how the presence
                    of lead would affect the value of tin dross. This would affect the quantum of
                    the Bank’s loss which I will come to later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Although the evidence of Choong suggested
                    that tin dross normally contains tin content of between 50% and 70%, neither
                    side relied much on this evidence. This was presumably because Choong stated in
                    his AEIC that his experience with tin products came from his work with one
                    specific company, Escoy Smelting Pte Ltd (“Escoy”), where he had
                    worked for over 30 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> He
                    further explained during cross-examination that he had arrived at the figure of
                    50%–70% based on samples of tin dross he had taken during his entire
                    career with Escoy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> In other words, while Choong was familiar with
                    tin products and tin refining processes in general, he was not in a position to
                    give specific evidence about STI’s particular tin refining process and the
                    quality of the material used in its refining.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I therefore find that the Bank has failed to
                    prove on a balance of probabilities that the CQs issued by CWT for tin dross
                    were false or misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether CWT’s breach of the CMA by failing to inform the Bank
                that tin dross was not physically leaving and entering the Warehouse caused the
                Bank’s losses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Mr Jeremiah submitted that the Bank
                    would not have suffered losses of US$10,602,084 and $104,860 but for CWT’s
                    breach of the CMA. He referred to the case of <em>Sunny Metal
                        &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 782 (“<em>Sunny Metal</em>”)
                    where the Court of Appeal held (at [63]) that the “but for” test
                    in tort also applied in contract cases to determine whether a defendant’s
                    breach had, as a matter of fact, caused the plaintiff’s
                loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Applying this test to the present facts,
                    Mr Jeremiah submitted that if CWT had informed the Bank of the non-movement
                    of tin dross in and out of the Warehouse, the Bank would have discovered that
                    the dross was being round-tripped and consequently would not have advanced money
                    to STI based on the security of the tin dross. This was evidenced by the
                    testimony of Clement Tan and Egberts. Clement Tan elaborated that the Bank would
                    have demanded an explanation from STI and terminated the Facilities Agreement if
                    it had known about the round-tripping of tin dross,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>
                    while Egberts said that he would not have approved STI’s requests for
                    drawdowns if he had known of the same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Since the Bank
                    would not have financed the tin dross if it had known about the round-tripping,
                    it would follow that the Bank would also not have incurred the treatment and
                    disposal costs of $104,860 when it discovered that the tin dross was
                    contaminated with lead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CWT’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Mr Tan, on the other hand, argued that
                    the Bank had caused its own loss by extending loans to STI without heeding
                    various red flags that had been raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    First, all the tin dross that was
                    purportedly being sold to STI had come from KJP (whom I referred to above at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>). The various invoices KJP
                        issued<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> to STI in respect of these purported
                    sales showed that both companies shared the same address <em>ie</em>, 61 Tuas Crescent. The invoices were also signed on behalf of
                    KJP by Janice Ku, who was one of STI’s main directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Secondly, STI had purportedly sold tin dross
                    to third party companies by the names of Penggerang Pte Ltd, Rich Achieve
                    Enterprise Ltd, and River Bright Industrial Co. However, the SWIFT advices in
                    respect of the payments for some of these alleged sales showed that it was KJP
                    who had been making the payments to STI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Thus the alleged vendor of
                    tin dross to STI was also the paymaster for STI’s sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Thirdly, there was a letter dated
                    25 February 2008 from STI to the Bank where STI’s address was
                    displayed as “10 Ubi Crescent, #05-27 (Lobby B) Ubi
                        Techpark”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> This
                    address was identical to that of Penggerang Pte Ltd, one of the third party
                    “purchasers” of tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Mr Tan thus argued that the Bank had
                    access to all this information and was in a position to make further enquiries.
                    Had it probed further, it would have realised that STI was actually buying and
                    selling tin dross from itself and could have stopped the fraud in its
                    tracks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Mr Tan further contended that at the
                    very least, the Bank should have closely scrutinised the price KJP charged STI
                    for the purported purchases of tin dross since it knew STI and KJP were closely
                    related companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Mr Tan concluded that on the whole, the
                    Bank had been rather lax in its dealings with STI and this was further evidenced
                    by the fact that the Bank had not taken steps to monitor the movement of the
                    released tin dross to ensure that it was delivered to its purchasers.
                    Mr Tan concluded that this lax attitude was the effective cause of the
                    Bank’s losses, not CWT’s breaches of the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preliminary issue – Lack of particulars in CWT’s
                pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I will first address a preliminary objection
                    taken by Mr Jeremiah. CWT in its Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment
                    No 3) had pleaded at para 40(b):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any alleged loss or damage allegedly suffered by the Plaintiff is a
                        consequence of its own assessment of the financial creditworthiness of STI
                        and/or a result of its own financial interactions or further dealings with
                        STI (and possibly others) with regard to or in relation to the financing of
                        the goods, which the Defendant is not privy to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr Jeremiah submitted that CWT’s
                    pleadings were too vague and lacked sufficient particulars to give the Bank any
                    notice of the case it would have to meet. CWT had in fact taken advantage of
                    this vagueness to fish for evidence during the trial to support its contentions
                    on causation. As a result, the Bank had been embarrassed and prejudiced and CWT
                    should thus not be allowed to pursue its above arguments on causation. In this
                    regard Mr Jeremiah referred to the case of <em>Thomas &amp; Betts
                        (S.E. Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joon</em> [1998] SGHC 57
                        (“<em>Thomas &amp; Betts</em>”) where Lai
                    Siu Chiu J held (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a clear rule of pleading that ‘every pleading must contain the
                        necessary particulars of any claim’ (O 18 r 12(1) of the RSC). In the
                        absence of providing adequate particulars, and in the absence of any
                        explanation as to why these particulars were inadequate, I was constrained
                        in finding that there were insufficient facts in the pleadings to support
                        the cause of action. I did not think it fair that a plaintiff should be
                        allowed to allege first, and then through the process of discovery or
                        interrogatories, hope to substantiate those allegations later – that
                        would be tantamount to ‘fishing’ which any court would
                        vigilantly guard against in balancing the interests and rights of the
                        parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    It bears noting that Lai J’s
                    decision in <em>Thomas &amp; Betts</em> was one involving
                    the striking out of a statement of claim at the interlocutory stage. It was not
                    a case where a party had proceeded all the way to trial without giving
                    sufficient particulars in his pleadings and was subsequently precluded from
                    relying on them, despite no earlier objection being taken by the other side. If
                    the Bank felt prejudiced by the vagueness of CWT’s pleadings, it should
                    have applied for further and better particulars and/or to strike out that part
                    of CWT’s defence at the outset. Having come all the way to trial without
                    any objection, the Bank cannot be heard to complain now about the lack of
                    particularisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Mr Jeremiah argued that the onus of
                    particularisation should be on CWT and that the Bank has no duty to assist CWT
                    in pointing out inadequacies in its case. With respect, Mr Jeremiah’s
                    argument misses the point. It is one thing to assist the other side by pointing
                    out the inadequacies in its case, and another thing to <em>object</em> to being prejudiced by such inadequacies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In any event, CWT did plead the following in
                    paragraph 40(c) of its Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is denied that the performance of the duties undertaken by the
                        Defendant pursuant to the CMA caused any alleged loss or damage allegedly
                        suffered by the Plaintiff. Further, the Defendant is not liable for any such
                        alleged loss or damage as they are too remote and the Defendant further
                        cannot reasonably be regarded as having undertaken responsibility for such
                        alleged loss or damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, it was still for the Bank to establish that CWT’s
                    failure to inform it of the movement of tin dross caused it to continue to
                    finance the tin dross and the subsequent cost of treating and disposing of the
                    tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether CWT’s failure to inform the Bank of the non-movement of
                tin dross caused the Bank’s losses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I accept Mr Tan’s submission that
                    there had been red flags relating to KJP and the third party purchasers of tin
                    dross which the Bank could have picked up on, but did not. What would have
                    happened if CWT had informed the Bank about the non-movement of the tin dross?
                    It was likely that the Bank would have asked STI for an explanation as Clement
                    Tan himself alluded to in his AEIC, but it seems to me that it does not
                    necessarily follow that the Bank would have terminated the Facilities Agreement.
                    This was a quantum leap. In my view the likely scenario was that STI would have
                    given some sort of explanation to the Bank. The Bank might have accepted the
                    explanation or STI and the Bank might have reached some other
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I would add that Clement Tan had probably
                    exaggerated when he said that the Bank would have terminated the entire
                    Facilities Agreement. That was a comment made with the benefit of hindsight. The
                    Bank might have terminated the financing of the tin dross if it was not
                    satisfied with any explanation given by STI, but not necessarily the entire
                    Facilities Agreement. Indeed, Egberts said in his AEIC that he would not have
                    approved drawdowns in respect of the purchases of tin dross if he had known
                    about the round-tripping of the same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> He did not say
                    the Bank would have terminated the Facilities Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    However, in the circumstances, I do not
                    conclude that the Bank would necessarily have terminated the financing of the
                    tin dross had it been informed by CWT about the non-movement of the
                same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It seems to me that the omission to tell the
                    Bank about the non-movement of tin dross meant that the Bank had lost the chance
                    of seeking an explanation from STI and reviewing its own position, with the
                    possibility of terminating the financing of the tin dross. This “loss of
                    a chance” analysis was mentioned as a possible approach on the question
                    of causation in <em>Sunny Metal</em> at [74]. Unfortunately
                    for the Bank, it has not claimed for the loss of a chance here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Therefore, I reject the Bank’s
                    allegation that it would necessarily have terminated the Facilities Agreement or
                    even the financing for tin dross if CWT had informed it that tin dross was not
                    leaving and entering the Warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the CQs caused the Bank’s losses if they were false or
                misleading</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I have already found above that the Bank has
                    failed to prove that the CQs issued by CWT for tin dross were false or
                    misleading. However, for the sake of completeness, I would add that even if the
                    Bank had proven that the tin content in the dross was lower than what was
                    reflected in the CQs, it did not necessarily follow that the Bank would have
                    terminated the financing of the tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Egberts alluded to the figure of 70% in
                    cross-examination as being the minimum required tin content for any tin product
                    before the Bank would finance that particular product.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> This figure was
                    presumably derived from the CMA which stipulated a minimum required tin content
                    of 70% for “Tin Concentrates”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> However, it is unclear whether the
                    figure of 70% automatically applied to tin dross.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Even if I accept Egberts’ evidence
                    that 70% was the minimum required tin content for tin dross, what that means is
                    that the Bank has to prove not only that the tin content in the CQs was
                    incorrect, but that it was less than 70%. If the tin content in the tin dross
                    was still over 70%, the Bank would still have advanced money to STI, albeit of a
                    lesser amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Bank’s losses are too remote</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    I next consider whether the Bank’s
                    losses of US$10,602,084 in unpaid advances and $104,860 incurred in treating and
                    disposing of the tin dross are too remote in any event. The law on remoteness of
                    damage in Singapore contract law was definitively settled in the recent Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd v Fish &amp; Co
                        Restaurant Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGCA 36 (“<em>MFM Restaurants</em>”). The court affirmed the
                    continued application of the principles laid down in <em>Hadley v
                        Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch 341 and elaborated upon in <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623, in that a plaintiff claiming for
                    breach of contract may only recover in respect of damages which (1) were
                    reasonably contemplated as liable to result from the breach, or (2) which
                    the defendant had actual knowledge of. The court in <em>MFM
                        Restaurants</em> expressly rejected the additional legal criterion of
                    assumption of responsibility introduced by Lord Hoffmann in <em>Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc, The Achilleas</em>
                    [2009] 1 AC 61.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    I am of the opinion that the Bank’s
                    loss in financing tin dross is not too remote as a <em>type</em> of damage if causation had been established. It was
                    reasonably contemplated that the Bank would finance the tin dross based on the
                    security of the WRs and CQs issued by CWT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    If CWT had also breached the CMA in issuing
                    false or misleading CQs, the Bank’s loss would likewise be reasonably
                    contemplated in relation to such a breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I reject Mr Tan’s argument that
                    the only losses by the Bank which were reasonably contemplated were those
                    relating to any damage or loss to the security itself. Mr Tan’s
                    argument assumes that CWT’s only responsibility was to safeguard the
                    Bank’s security but, as I have said above (at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>–<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>), CWT also
                    had obligations as a collateral manager within the context of a trade finance
                    arrangement and these obligations extended to informing the Bank if there was no
                    physical movement of the goods it was financing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    As for the $104,860 which the Bank incurred
                    in the treatment and disposal of the tin dross, I am of the view that such loss
                    is too remote to be recoverable by the Bank in any event, whether or not
                    CWT’s fault consists of the failure to inform it about the non-movement of
                    tin dross and/or the issuance of inaccurate CQs. The Bank’s loss here
                    resulted from the tin dross being contaminated with lead, which was not
                    something that was reasonably contemplated. It seems that the scope of
                    CWT’s duties to the Bank in respect of tin dross was only to determine the
                    tin content therein and did not extend to testing the tin dross for lead. That
                    is why the Bank accepted the CQs even when they reflected the tin content
                    only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Indeed, it was also not made clear to me why
                    a potential purchaser would offer US$10,000 for the tin dross and tin
                    concentrate when it would cost $104,860 to treat and dispose of the tin dross.
                    There was no elaboration as to how much the tin concentrate was worth. I was not
                    satisfied that the Bank had reasonably incurred such a cost in the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate quantum of loss</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Even though the Bank’s financing of
                    tin dross was not too remote a type of damage, this does not mean that CWT would
                    be liable to compensate the Bank for the full US$10,602,084 (assuming the other
                    elements of the Bank’s claim are made out). The Bank would still have to
                    prove that it was reasonable for it to advance US$10,602,084 on the security of
                    tin dross based on the formula agreed between the Bank and STI. This is an issue
                    not of remoteness, but quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    For example, suppose it was established that
                    the objective value of the tin dross at the time of the advances (based on the
                    tin content reflected in the CQs) was US$1m, it would be reasonable for the Bank
                    to advance an equivalent amount, minus a margin, to STI. Would it then be
                    reasonable for the Bank to have advanced US$10m based on the security of the
                    US$1m tin dross, and expect CWT to indemnify it for the full sum it had
                    advanced? The answer clearly is “no”. Although it was reasonably
                    contemplated that the Bank would lend money on the security of the WRs and CQs
                    issued by CWT, this does not mean that CWT should be held liable for any amount
                    of money that the Bank chose to advance to STI. Therefore, it was incumbent on
                    the Bank to show that its formula to determine the quantum advanced was
                    reasonable and that the amount it advanced, on the assumption that the tin
                    content as stated in the CQs for tin dross was accurate, was
                reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    In this regard, some consideration of the
                    Facilities Agreement between the Bank and STI is required. Clause 1 of the
                    Facilities Agreement provided the following definitions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Mr Tan proceeded on the basis that the
                    percentages of 88% and 65% for tin concentrates and tin slag respectively were
                    used by the Bank to factor in the cost of extracting pure tin from these two
                    products, and transportation costs. This was accepted by Clement Tan in
                    cross-examination, but actually, there was no other evidence that the Bank had
                    applied its mind to the cost of extracting tin from these two products or the
                    transportation costs. Indeed, Clement Tan also said that these were arbitrary
                    formulae inherited from the previous financing arrangement that STI had
                        obtained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As for tin dross, there was no prescribed
                    formula in the Facilities Agreement as to how much money the Bank would advance
                    to finance the dross. Apparently, the Bank and STI eventually agreed that the
                    Market Price for tin dross would be calculated as: (LME price – US$100)
                    multiplied by the percentage of tin content stated in the CQs. This was also the
                    price which KJP “charged” STI for each batch of tin dross. The
                    Bank would then finance 85% of the Market Price under Clause 4(2)(b) of the
                    Facilities Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    What all this meant, basically, was that the
                    Bank was financing 85% of each batch of tin dross which STI
                    “purchased” from KJP based on KJP’s invoice price, which was
                    in turn based on the Market Price agreed upon between the Bank and STI for tin
                    dross. However, the Bank did not establish that at the time of the advances the
                    formula of (LME price – US$100) multiplied by the percentage of tin
                    content stated in the CQs, used to calculate the Market Price of tin dross, was
                    reasonable. Neither did it establish that it was reasonable to lend 85% of such
                    Market Price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Furthermore, if indeed tin dross can be
                    contaminated because of the presence of lead as the Bank was suggesting after
                    the event, there was no evidence as to how often lead is found in tin dross and
                    what amount of lead would constitute contamination and how this would affect the
                    value of the tin dross and the computation of the amount to be
                advanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The truth of the matter is that the Bank did
                    not know what it was doing especially when it came to tin dross. It simply
                    agreed to an arbitrary formula to determine the amount to be advanced on the
                    security of tin dross (in addition to the other security it had), without even
                    establishing the objective value of tin dross with such tin content as stated in
                    the CQs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In the circumstances, I find that the Bank
                    has also not established that it was reasonable for it to advance what it did
                    and accordingly it has not established the quantum of its loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Bank’s alternative claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In light of my above findings, it is not
                    necessary for me to deal with the Bank’s alternative claims for fraudulent
                    or negligent misrepresentation as it would encounter the same problems relating
                    to causation and quantification of loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CWT’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    CWT’s counterclaim clearly has no
                    merit. Clause 11.1 of the CMA states that STI was to pay CWT’s fees
                    and charges. Clause 11.3 further states that if STI does not pay any fee or
                    charge, CWT’s only remedy shall be a claim against STI for
                        damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The
                    Bank has no liability to CWT under the CMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss both
                    the claim and counterclaim. I will hear the parties on costs.</p>
