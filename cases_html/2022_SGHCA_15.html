The respondents in CA 68 are Mr Teo Cher Koon (“Teo”) and Mr Tan Thiam Chye (“TTC”). TTC is also the appellant in AD/CA 75/2021 (“CA 75”), whilst TCH is the respondent. CA 68 and CA 75 are TCH’s and TTC’s appeals against the decisions of the trial judge (“the Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock v Teo Cher Koon and another suit</span> [2021] SGHC 175 (“the Judgment”). The Judgment was the Judge’s decisions on two separate suits: HC/S 743/2019 (“Suit 743”) and HC/S 1089/2020 (“Suit 1089”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Suit 743 was a claim brought by TCH against Teo for damages for misrepresentation and money owing to him under an indemnity which Teo allegedly gave TCH (“the Alleged Indemnity”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Suit 1089 was a claim brought by TTC against TCH pursuant to a loan which TTC allegedly gave TCH (“the Alleged Loan”). He claimed for the sum owing under the Alleged Loan, as well as loss of profits and loss of dividends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Both suits were heard one after the other on the basis that the evidence in one would apply to the evidence in the other and vice versa. The Judge dismissed Suit 743 and allowed Suit 1089, finding that the Alleged Indemnity did not exist, but that the Alleged Loan did. She ordered TCH to pay the sum owing under the Alleged Loan to TTC. However, she did not award TTC loss of profits or loss of dividends and ordered interest to run from the date of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Now, both TCH and TTC appeal against the Judge’s decisions. CA 68 is TCH’s appeal against the Judge’s decision that the Alleged Indemnity did not exist, and that the Alleged Loan did. On the other hand, CA 75 is TTC’s appeal against the Judgment in Suit 1089 in so far as she dismissed TTC’s claim for loss of profits and loss of dividends. Alternatively, TTC is appealing against her decision to order interest on the Sum to run from the date of the writ only instead of interest to run from 13 August 2015 (being the date the Alleged Loan was to be repaid).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Teo is the managing-director and president of ISDN Holdings Limited (“ISDN”), a company listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.

Indeed, Mr Zhulkarnain Bin Abdul Rahim (“Mr Zhulkarnain”), counsel for TCH, suggested that TCH had only dropped that claim, but did not necessarily agree that the misrepresentations had not been made.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We originally understood this to mean that our decision could only result in one of two outcomes: either only the Alleged Indemnity existed, or only the Alleged Loan existed. However, we had misgivings over such an approach and clarified this point with the parties. At the hearing of the appeals, it was accepted by Mr Zhulkarnain that the choice was not binary in the sense that we had understood it. Importantly, he agreed that it could be that neither the Alleged Loan nor the Alleged Indemnity was established on the balance of probabilities. Teo and TTC also took the same position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This must be correct. A plaintiff in a civil suit must prove his case on the balance of probabilities. A plaintiff proves his case “on the balance of probabilities” when he shows that his case is more probably true than not true: <span class="font-italic">Clarke Beryl Claire (personal representative of the estate of Eugene Francis Clarke, deceased) and others v SilkAir (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1136 at [58]. He does not meet this burden by showing his case is a “better explanation” for certain events than the defendant’s. This means that a trier of fact is not bound to prefer one of the parties’ assertions. A third alternative is available where the state of the evidence is unsatisfactory: the judge may simply find that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden: <span class="font-italic">Wee Yue Chew v </span><span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 212 at [8]<span class="font-italic"> </span>citing <span class="font-italic">Popi</span><span class="font-italic"> M </span>[1985] 1 WLR 948.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 An example may explain this. Take for instance, a case where a plaintiff is suing a defendant for negligence causing a fire. In that case, the key factual issue would be the cause of the fire. However, due to any number of factors, the state of the evidence is dismal, and parties are unable to offer a reasonable or believable explanation as to the cause of the fire. In such a case, the trier of fact does not have to prefer the less incredible explanation. He may simply make no finding of fact and hold that the plaintiff is unable to discharge his burden.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We pause to stress that these principles apply even if the facts are within the personal knowledge of the parties. In the above example, the cause of the fire may not be within the personal knowledge of the parties – they can only piece together the cause from physical and expert evidence. However, even where the facts of the case are within the personal knowledge of the parties, a trier of fact is not obliged to accept one of the parties’ version of events. The reason for this is that parties may, for reasons best known to themselves, be less than forthcoming with the <span class="font-italic">true </span>facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The indemnity claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The main thrust of the indemnity claim was the Alleged Indemnity, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Teo had promised TCH that he would indemnify him for any losses arising out of TCH’s trading in ISDN shares.

</div> Similarly, the Judge also spent a considerable amount of time considering the Share Parking Allegation in her decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Despite this, we are of the view that it is unnecessary to make a finding on whether the Goh Deal or even the TTC Deal was a share parking arrangement. This is because, even if the TTC Deal was a share parking arrangement, it does not necessarily mean that Teo gave TCH the Alleged Indemnity. Whether Teo parked his shares with TTC, and whether he agreed to indemnify TCH are two separate matters. Neither would a finding that Teo had parked shares with TTC necessarily assist in TCH’s defence against TTC’s loan claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The difficulty with TCH’s reliance on the Share Parking Allegation is that it assumes that the 11.5 million shares allegedly parked with TTC were the <span class="font-italic">only</span> ISDN shares TTC had owned at the material time.

However, in paragraph 2(i) of the First LOD, it was asserted that Teo had represented that it “would be a good investment to acquire shares in [ISDN]” and that he “had further promised to make good on any losses suffered by [TCH] as a result of investing in [ISDN].”

Below, the Judge found this to be “commercially absurd” as there was “no reason for Teo to give an unlimited or open-ended indemnity out of his desperation to maintain the share price at a certain level”. She came to this conclusion as none of the memorandums of understanding or public announcements made by ISDN in 2013 referred to a requirement that ISDN’s share price be maintained at a certain level.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, even if we accept that Teo had an interest in maintaining the share price of ISDN, this does not necessarily mean that Teo would have given such a wide and unlimited indemnity. The Alleged Indemnity as pleaded would open Teo up to huge and unknown personal liability. There was no reason for Teo to give such a blanket indemnity. Related to this, on TCH’s case, Teo did not give him any instructions on the amount of ISDN shares to buy, and at what price to buy and sell them (see [44] above). This essentially meant that Teo was giving free rein to TCH whereby TCH could end up incurring significant losses that Teo would eventually have to cover. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thus, we would agree with the Judge that the Alleged Indemnity, as pleaded by TCH, was a “commercially absurd” arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TCH’s own delay in bringing an action </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Finally, it is relevant that it took almost five years for TCH to commence an action against Teo for the sum owed under the Alleged Indemnity. In defending against the loan claim, TCH argues that TTC’s delay in claiming the Sum owing under the Alleged Loan shows that TTC’s action is not in good faith. However, this logic must cut both ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On TCH’s own case, the Alleged Indemnity would have come to an end around December 2013, by which point he had suffered huge losses in propping up ISDN’s share price. Yet, he only sought and received partial payment in November 2014 (the November 2014 Transfers). Even if we look past this initial delay, TCH then waited another year before the First LOD dated 25 November 2015 was sent. Then, after the First LOD did not result in any further payment to him, he waited a further three and a half years before the Second LOD dated 4 July 2019 was sent. This delay of three and a half years casts doubt on the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of TCH’s indemnity claim, especially considering the amount of money he is claiming. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the indemnity claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 TCH’s case was inconsistent, commercially absurd, and his conduct in buying ISDN shares did not support the claim on the Alleged Indemnity. We are of the opinion that TCH has not shown that the Judge erred in finding that TCH had failed to meet his burden in proving the Alleged Indemnity. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to address the point whether there would have been an intention by Teo to create legal relations if he had given the Alleged Indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The loan claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We now come to TTC’s claim against TCH which rested on an oral loan agreement. To reiterate, according to TTC, TCH had approached him for a loan in November 2014. As TTC did not have the cash to make the loan, TCH proposed that TTC sell some of his ISDN shares and use the net sale proceeds to make the loan. TTC agreed and sold 8 million ISDN shares in the open market at $0.29 <span class="font-italic">per</span> share from 13 to 17 November 2014 (see [10] above). From the sale proceeds, the Sum ($2,314,041.39) was then paid to TCH and his associates from 13 to 24 November 2014 in six tranches (see [12] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The importance of the November 2014 Transfers </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is undisputed that the November 2014 Transfers occurred. This raised the question of whether we were entitled to presume that it was meant to be repaid. In the case of <span class="font-italic">Power Solar System Co Ltd (in liquidation) v </span><span class="font-italic">Suntech Power Investment Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGHC 233 (“<span class="font-italic">Power Solar</span>”), Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi JC (as she then was), held that once a plaintiff proves payment (in the absence of circumstances justifying a presumption of advancement or any other plausible explanation as to why the sum of money was advanced), the court is entitled to infer that the sum of money was meant to be repaid, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a presumption of an obligation to repay arises. The question then is whether the circumstances surrounding the payment of money would disentitle the plaintiff from asking the court to draw such an inference: at [103(d)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In making this proposition, she relied on the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Seldon v Davison </span>[1968] 1 WLR 1083 (“<span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Seldon </span>the plaintiff had advanced the defendant a sum of money to purchase a house. The defendant admitted to receiving the money but asserted that it was a gift from the plaintiff. The English Court of Appeal held that the defendant bore the burden of proving that the payment was a gift. However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT Bayan Resources TBK and another v BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another</span> [2019] 1 SLR 30 observed that <span class="font-italic">Seldon </span>was wrongly decided: see [140]–[144]. The court noted that in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>, the defence denied the essential ingredient in a loan, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant did not admit that he had incurred a debt. Thus, it could not be presumed that such a debt had been incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Similarly, in this case, TCH has denied ever incurring a debt. His position is that the November 2014 Transfers were the partial payment of the Alleged Indemnity by Teo through TTC (see [19(d)] above). Thus, the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Power Solar</span> cannot apply in the present case either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Thus, although it is undisputed that TTC made payments of the Sum to TCH or persons nominated by TCH, the burden is still on TTC to prove the purpose of the payments, as mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Choo Cheng</span> <span class="font-italic">Tong Wi</span><span class="font-italic">lfred v Phua Swee Khiang and another</span> [2022] SGHC(A) 5 at [15]. In other words, the court will not infer that the purpose is a loan just by the mere receipt of the Sum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The existence of the Alleged Loan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We now move to consider whether TTC has proved the Alleged Loan. However, before going into the evidence, we consider two preliminary points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The first point relates to the manner in which the burden of proof is discharged. We note that initially the Judge did not assume that because she had dismissed the indemnity claim, this would necessarily mean that TTC’s loan claim would be successful. She went on to find on the evidence that TTC had proved the loan claim. However, it appears that she was much influenced by a comparison of the two allegations. She found that TTC’s explanation of a loan for the payment of the Sum was a “better explanation” for the parties’ conduct and the documents before the court than TCH’s explanation that the payment was pursuant to an indemnity from Teo. She then concluded that the payment was pursuant to a loan as claimed by TTC.

</div> In so doing, the Judge was effectively applying a binary approach. With respect, we do not think that such an approach is correct. The Judge should have considered that perhaps neither explanation was established on the evidence (as noted at [31] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On a related note, we note that the Judge took into account the fact that TTC had paid cash of $578,510.55 as the first of the six payments even before TTC had received the net sale proceeds of his first sale of ISDN shares. To her, this pointed more to a loan rather than an indemnity as TTC would have waited for the sale proceeds rather than pay from his own pocket if TTC was paying on behalf of Teo.

</div>
</div> In our view, that might support her conclusion that there was no indemnity but, as explained, it is not a binary situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As a second preliminary point, it bears emphasizing that TTC’s position is that the Alleged Loan was an oral agreement between himself and TCH; no other witnesses were present. This is key as the Judge had relied on the communications between Teo and TTC as support for her finding that the Alleged Loan existed.

</div>
</div> Leaving aside TCH’s argument that these communications contained fabrications of a loan, on which we address later, we do not agree that the communications were strong proof of the existence of the Alleged Loan. Teo did not have personal knowledge of the Alleged Loan. Thus, any reference to it in his communications with TTC was essentially hearsay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 This means that whether the Alleged Loan exists would be based largely on the competing evidence of and from TTC and TCH. The Judge had found that TCH was not a credible witness, and this may have played a part in her deciding that the Alleged Loan did exist. We are aware that an appellate court should be slow to disturb findings of fact by a trial judge, especially when such findings concern the credibility of a witness. However, appellate intervention is warranted in certain situations, for example where the trial judge’s determination of the witness’s credibility leaves untouched other evidence which requires separate evaluation:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 894 at [131] citing [68] of <span class="font-italic">Sakthivel </span><span class="font-italic">Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 983.

As noted above, Teo and TTC had averred in their letters, on 6 December 2015 and 20 December 2015 respectively, that TCH had taken a loan from TTC. It is also undisputed that he did not reply to either. With regard to the 20 December 2015 letter, TCH’s position was that he had not received the letter.

</div> However, with regard to the 6 December 2015 letter, the Judge observed that there was no response from TCH’s lawyers at that time to dispute the loan allegation which would logically be expected if TCH genuinely disputed the existence of the Alleged Loan. She considered this to be against TCH’s denial of the loan.

While the Judge was correct to find that TCH’s lack of prompt rejection of the Alleged Loan weighed against him, she appeared to have overlooked the importance of a significant discrepancy in TTC’s 20 December 2015 letter.

With regard to (a), according to TTC, the loan was orally agreed on 12 November 2014 and the nine months would have expired on 13 August 2015. It seems to us that 12 August 2015 may be the correct date, but as nothing material turns on this, for present purposes, we will adopt 13 August 2015 as the appropriate nine-month repayment date. With regard to (b), it was not disputed that TLV was listed on 17 September 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Thus, on TTC’s case, the relevant deadline should be 13 August 2015 and <span class="font-italic">not</span> the 17 September 2015 public listing date of TLV (also referred to as the Initial Public Offering date or the “IPO date” for short). For completeness, we mention that on 13 August 2015, the closing price of ISDN shares was below $0.29 <span class="font-italic">per</span> share.

Indeed, the letter referred to the IPO date twice. This was not just a case of TTC omitting to state all the Express Terms. As per Express Term One, the IPO date was no longer relevant – the applicable date was the nine-month repayment date of 13 August 2015. TTC must have known this if the Alleged Loan and the Express Terms were genuine. Yet, instead, he referred to a repayment date that was no longer applicable – this was a <span class="font-italic">glaring inconsistency</span> in TTC’s case.

In his AEICs in both Suit 743 and Suit 1089, he had alleged that in February 2015, TCH had approached him for additional financial support. However, he declined the request and reminded TCH about his obligation to repay the loan that was falling due in August 2015.

Neither did each voucher mention the sale price of the shares sold even though the sale price was important for the purpose of Express Term Two.

TTC also added that it would have been crucial that the terms of such a guarantee were clear and that his potential secondary obligations to TCH were limited.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It seems to us that this was an important piece of evidence which the Judge had overlooked. TTC, in his own words, was not someone who decried formality for important commercial matters, but quite to the contrary. His oral evidence about not having enough space to record the Express Terms on small pieces of paper and a poor standard of English was contradicted by the evidence in his AEIC for the need to properly document important commercial matters, especially for a sum which was not small. In the circumstances, the absence of any mention of a loan or any of the Express Terms in the Payment Vouchers and the absence of any other documentary evidence thereon suggested that the Alleged Loan and its Express Terms did not exist. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TCH’s new points on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 We also mention some interesting points raised by TCH on appeal. The Payment Vouchers only mentioned the net sums paid to TCH. They excluded the costs of the sales to TTC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the brokerage commission and the exchange fee. While these were not large sums, it did not make sense for TTC to exclude them in his computation of the loan amount as they constituted a cost to him for procuring the Sum for TCH. Furthermore, there was no mention of TCH having to repay or make up any dividend lost by TTC during the period before the loan was repaid. Logically, that would also have been included in a genuine loan. However, as TTC was not cross-examined on these points at trial, it was too late for TCH to raise them in argument before us. Hence, we give no weight to them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TTC’s delay in seeking repayment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, we consider TTC’s delay in seeking repayment and suing TCH. It is undisputed that TTC only began legal action against TCH for the loan claim almost six years after the Alleged Loan was given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The delay is incongruous with TTCs’ claim for loss of profits and dividends. Aside from the Sum, TTC had claimed that he would have immediately repurchased the 8 million ISDN shares after repayment. Since he did not repurchase the shares because he had not been repaid, he had been deprived of profits from the increased value of the shares and had also been deprived of the dividends from those shares. Thus, on his own case, he was seeking to repurchase the shares as soon as he could. Given this urgency, it seems strange that he did not chase TCH for repayment sooner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It is also concerning that the first letter from TTC to TCH to seek repayment of the loan was TTC’s 20 December 2015 letter to TCH. This was sent only after Teo had told TTC about the First LOD from TCH (see [73(a), 73(b) and 73(e)] above). TCH argues that Teo was “dictating” what TTC needed to say so that Teo could thwart TCH’s claim against him.

First, it is not clear how the COVID-19 pandemic deterred TTC from filing an action for more than half a year. Further, on TTC’s own evidence, it was Teo who had galvanised him into action.

</div> but it seems to us that she was too sanguine in her views of Teo’s and TTC’s motivations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 While we accept that mere delay in taking action may not in itself carry any adverse inference, the circumstances before us go beyond a mere delay. In our opinion, the delay, read with how TTC would only take action after prodding from Teo, was another reason for doubting the existence of the Alleged Loan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the loan claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Therefore, although the Judge found TCH not to be a credible witness, we are of the view that the Judge had erred in finding that the Alleged Loan existed. For all the reasons mentioned above, TTC has failed to discharge his burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In summary, both the indemnity claim and the loan claim have failed. Accordingly, we allow part of CA 68 which is that part of TCH’s appeal against the Judge’s decision that the Alleged Loan existed, by setting aside that part of the Judgment which ordered him to pay the Sum to TTC with interest. It follows that CA 75, which is TTC’s appeal against the Judge’s decision to (a) not award him loss of profits and/or dividends and (b) not order interest on the Sum to run from 13 August 2015, is dismissed. Accordingly, we vary the costs orders made by the Judge with regard to the trial below: (a) with regard to the costs of Suit 743, we uphold the Judge’s decision to award costs to Teo on a standard basis to be taxed unless otherwise agreed; and (b) with regard to the costs of Suit 1089, we set aside the Judge’s order that TTC be awarded costs. Instead, TCH is awarded costs on a standard basis to be taxed unless otherwise agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 With regard to the costs of the two present appeals, we make the following orders: (a) TCH is to pay Teo the costs of TCH’s appeal against the dismissal of his indemnity claim which we fix at $40,000 all in; and (b) TTC is to pay TCH the costs of TCH’s successful appeal in setting aside that part of the Judgment which ordered him to pay the Sum to TTC with interest and the costs of TTC’s own unsuccessful appeal. Costs are fixed at $40,000 all in. The usual consequential orders apply.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Belinda Ang Saw Ean<br>Judge of the Appellate Division </br></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Woo Bih Li<br>Judge of the Appellate Division</br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br>Judge of the High Court</br></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Zhulkarnain Bin Abdul Rahim, Too Fang Yi and Lum Rui Loong Manfred (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the appellant in AD/CA 68/2021/respondent in AD/CA 75/2021; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarjit Singh Gill <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Probin Stephan Dass, Hoang Linh Trang and Liew Zhi Hao (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the 1st respondent in AD/CA 68/2021;<br/>Chai Ming Fatt James and Wong Mo Yen Angela (James Chai &amp; Partners) for the 2nd respondent in AD/CA 68/2021/appellant in AD/CA 75/2021. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

He became acquainted with the respondents in CA 68, Mr Teo Cher Koon (“Teo”) and Mr Tan Thiam Chye (“TTC”) in 2012. Teo was a major shareholder and managing director of a publicly listed company known as “ISDN”. TTC is a businessman and met Teo in 2010. He is also the appellant in Civil Appeal No 75 of 2021 (“CA 75”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 TCH bought a large volume of ISDN shares in late 2013 and allegedly suffered losses of around $5 million. He claimed that in September 2013, due to a crash in the market, Teo had asked him to help prop up the share price of ISDN and that Teo had promised to indemnify TCH for any loss that he would incur. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 TCH also claimed that Teo represented that TTC could effect payment pursuant to the indemnity. This would be carried out by Teo instructing TTC to sell ISDN shares that he had parked with TTC and to use the proceeds to effect payment. On this basis, TCH argued that partial payment of the indemnity came about in November 2014 when TTC sold 8 million ISDN shares and transferred the proceeds of over 2 million dollars to him (“the Sum”). Teo denied having given the indemnity. He also denied that TTC was holding ISDN shares on his behalf or that the Sum was partial payment by TTC on his behalf pursuant to the indemnity.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 TTC sued TCH one year after TCH had commenced his action against Teo. TTC claimed that the Sum was a loan from him to TCH. While the loan was orally agreed, it was evidenced by payment vouchers (“the Payment Vouchers”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Both suits were heard by the trial judge who dismissed TCH’s indemnity claim against Teo but allowed TTC’s loan claim against TCH. She awarded TTC the Sum with interest to run from the date of the writ. However, she did not allow his further claim for loss of profits and/or dividends or interest to run from an earlier date. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 TCH and TTC both appealed against the trial judge’s decision. CA 68 was TCH’s appeal against the trial judge’s decision to dismiss the indemnity claim and allow the loan claim. CA 75 was TTC’s appeal against the trial judge’s decision to award him the Sum with interest to run only from the date of the writ.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The court allowed TCH’s appeal in part. It dismissed his appeal against the trial judge’s decision with regard to the indemnity claim, but allowed his appeal against the trial judge’s decision to allow the loan claim. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 As a preliminary point, the court clarified that a plaintiff in a civil suit must prove that his case is more probably true than not true. It does not suffice for a plaintiff to show that his case is a better explanation for certain events than the defendant’s.  This means that a judge is not bound to prefer either parties’ assertions and may simply find that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[31]</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 On TCH’s indemnity claim, the court observed that part of TCH’s case was that Teo had parked shares with TTC, and thus the Sum TCH received from TTC in November 2014 was partial payment of the indemnity on behalf of Teo.  The court found it unnecessary to deal with this allegation, because, even if it was true, there was no evidence to show that the Sum was derived from the shares that Teo parked with TTC: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[38]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 With regard to the allegation that Teo had promised to indemnify TCH, the court found that the trial judge did not err in finding that TCH had not discharged his burden of proof. First, TCH’s case lacked specificity and consistency on material points: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[40]</span>. Second, TCH’s pattern of buying ISDN shares from September 2013 to December 2013 did not support his case that he was helping Teo prop up ISDN’s share price: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[50]</span>. Third, the indemnity, as pleaded by TCH, was commercially absurd as Teo had no reason to promise such a wide and unlimited indemnity: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span>. Finally, the court took into account TCH’s delay in bringing an action against Teo: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 Thus, the court held that TCH had not shown that the trial judge erred in finding that he had failed to meet his burden in proving the indemnity. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 With regard to TTC’s loan claim:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The court noted that while it was undisputed that TTC had transferred the Sum to TCH, it would not infer that it was a loan simply because the Sum was received by TCH: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">67]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The court observed that the trial judge had found that the loan was a “better explanation” for the transfer of the Sum than the indemnity. The court held that the trial judge should have considered that perhaps neither explanation was established on the evidence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[69]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The court also observed that TTC’s case was based on an oral agreement between him and TCH where no other witnesses were present. Thus, the existence of the loan was largely based on the competing evidence of TTC and TCH. Whilst an appellate court would usually not interfere in such situations, in this case, there was other evidence which showed that TTC had not discharged his burden: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[72]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. This evidence included the following. First, pre-action correspondence showed that TTC had been inconsistent on the date of repayment for the loan: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[80]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[85]</span>. Second, the court noted that the Payment Vouchers were silent on the terms of the loan – TTC was not someone who decried formality for important commercial matters. The omission to mention the terms suggested that the loan did not exist: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[93]</span>. Finally, the court was of the view that TTC’s delay in seeking repayment and suing TCH suggested that the loan claim was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, especially since TTC only sought repayment after prodding from Teo: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[103]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[104]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Thus, the court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that TTC had met his burden of proof, and thus reversed her decision to award TTC the Sum: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[105]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 As the trial judge’s decision to allow the loan claim was reversed, CA 75 was also dismissed. The court accordingly varied the costs orders made by the trial judge below. The court also ordered that TCH pay Teo $40,000 for the costs of CA 69, and that TTC pay TCH $40,000 for the costs of CA 68 and CA 75. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
