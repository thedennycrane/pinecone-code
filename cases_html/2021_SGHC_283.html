The Identity Misrepresentations, Financial Standing Fraud and Payment Misrepresentations were actionable in the tort of deceit as against the second and third defendants. Accordingly, it did not make a difference to the outcome whether there was a conspiracy as between these two. What mattered was whether the first defendant was part of any combination with these two.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 By participating in the Furniture Rebate Plan, the first defendant knew that there would be over-lending on the part of the plaintiff and concealment of the Furniture Rebates on the part of the Purchasers. However, this knowledge, even when seen alongside the various other factors asserted by the plaintiff, was insufficient to give rise to the inference that the first defendant had combined with the other defendants with the intention cause injury to the plaintiff. There was another plausible explanation for the first defendant’s behaviour, that is, it was primarily concerned with the sale of its own Units and was not bothered by the implications this purchasing arrangement had on the plaintiff. It then sought to keep its own sharp practice under wraps by keeping the Furniture Rebates away from the public eye and its own solicitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I was not prepared to extend the tort of unlawful means conspiracy to cover situations where the unlawful means reside in the unlawful acts committed by the plaintiff-victim as a consequence of the conspiracy, or an unlawful purpose pursued by the defendants.

It relied on the first defendant’s knowledge of various matters, such as the quiet state of the market. It also relied on the defendant’s various conduct, such as the timing the issuance of the letter documenting the Furniture Rebate (the “Furniture Rebate Letter”), which were allegedly aimed at facilitating the approval and disbursement of excess loans. These acts carried out by the first defendant entailed close coordination between all three defendants, and thus supported the inference that the first defendant had acted in combination with the other two defendants.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On the face of the Furniture Rebate Plan, there was no agreement on the part of the first defendant to suppress the existence of the Furniture Rebates. Even without the first defendant agreeing to conceal the existence of the Furniture Rebates, the Furniture Rebate Plan could still work. In relation to each Purchaser, the Furniture Rebate Plan required the first defendant to perform four acts (see above at [8]): (a) collect cheques for the 4% Option Fee and 15% Completion Fee, (b) issue the Furniture Rebate at an amount comprising the 4% Option Fee, the 15% Completion Fee, and a surplus sum, (c) credit the surplus sum to the Purchaser’s account and (d) return the cheques for the 4% Option Fee and 15% Completion Fee to the Purchasers on completion. The first defendant’s ability to perform each of these acts was technically independent of whether the Furniture Rebates were made known to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 That said, due to the way in which the Furniture Rebate Plan was structured, the first defendant must have realised that the financing bank would over-lend. With the return of the cheques for the 4% Option Fee and the 15% Completion Fee, the outcome of the Furniture Rebate Plan was that the Purchasers only needed to pay the 1% Option Fee. It would have been apparent to the first defendant, at the outset, that the rest of the purchase price would most likely be financed by the bank. From this alone, the first defendant must have known that there would be some unlawful activities going on at the loan procurement stage which would enable the Purchasers to game the system and obtain more loan than was legally permitted. Additionally, Ms Woo admitted that she knew that the bank had over-lent, and that the Purchasers did not disclose the Furniture Rebates, because she had excess amounts to credit to the Purchasers’ accounts.

</div> The fact there would be surplus sums paid to the Purchasers was already contemplated at the outset as part of the Furniture Rebate Plan (see above at [8]). In other words, Ms Woo’s admission meant that at the time the first defendant agreed to the Furniture Rebate Plan, the first defendant was already cognisant that there would be over-lending by the financing bank, and non-declaration of the Furniture Rebates by the Purchasers to the financing bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, the fact that the first defendant knew of these and went ahead with the Furniture Rebate Plan nevertheless, did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that the first defendant had also agreed to suppress the Furniture Rebates on its part to facilitate the Purchasers’ deceit vis-à-vis the plaintiff. There was another plausible explanation for such conduct, that is, the first defendant was simply not concerned with the circumstances under which excess loans were being procured by the Purchasers. Ms Woo took the position that she left it to the Purchasers to declare the Furniture Rebates,

</div> However, that the first defendant could have done a better job at documenting the Furniture Rebates could not support the inference that the first defendant was deliberately facilitating the Purchasers’ non-declaration of the Furniture Rebate. The omission to set out the Furniture Rebates on the OTPs did not put the first defendant in breach of any obligation to disclose. The late documentation of the Furniture Rebates did not present any major detriments to the first defendant’s commercial interests. In addition, Ms Woo gave two plausible explanations for the late issuance of the Furniture Rebate Letters: (a) if the OTP was not exercised, there would not be a need for the Furniture Rebate Letters since any agreement up to that stage on the sale of Units was only in-principle,

Although the Furniture Rebate Letters were issued only after the Purchasers had obtained approval for their Housing Loans, providing the Purchasers with these letters, which constitute a written record of the Furniture Rebates, would nonetheless have heightened the risk of the plaintiff discovering their existence. Moreover, there were two instances where the Furniture Rebate Letters were issued prior to the respective Purchasers obtaining approval for the Loans. This further weakens the likelihood that the first defendant had coordinated with the second and third defendants to facilitate the Purchasers’ non-declaration of the Furniture Rebates to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In addition, I was unable to find that the first defendant knew, or was willfully blind to, the fact that the Purchasers were financially constrained.

</div> However, I was unconvinced that the first defendant’s failure to inquire further or satisfy itself that the Purchasers had the requisite financial standing supported the inference that the first defendant was willfully blind to their lack of financial standing or the fact that they were fronts. The first defendant’s indifference could not be properly attributed to a motive to avoid finding out the truth, given that there was another plausible explanation for this muted reaction, that is, the first defendant was not in the position to investigate the creditworthiness of the Purchasers. As pointed out by the first defendant’s counsel, the first defendant was merely the vendor of the Units; it was for the Purchasers to take steps to finance the sale and for the financing bank to satisfy itself that the Purchasers were sufficiently creditworthy, even if they were nominees.

</div> Indeed, the financing bank would have greater access to a fuller set of information that could enable it to properly assess the Purchasers’ financial standing, and it was plausible that the first defendant chose to leave it to the financing bank to ascertain the creditworthiness of the Purchasers.

</div> If the first defendant had, in addition to the Furniture Rebate Plan, agreed to conceal the Furniture Rebates from the plaintiff as well, the effect of these agreements was to facilitate the Purchasers’ non-declaration of the Furniture Rebates and procurement of excess loans. This effect would have been apparent to Ms Woo, who admitted that she knew that the Furniture Rebates were being concealed from the plaintiff. However, such knowledge was insufficient to sustain the inference that Ms Woo had combined with the other defendants to deceive the plaintiff. This was because the first defendant’s agreement to the Furniture Rebate Plan and its alleged agreement to hide the Furniture Rebates were also consistent with another plausible explanation, that is, the first defendant had chosen to go along with these arrangements to facilitate the sale of its own Units, and was apathetic to the unlawful activities taking place at the loan procurement stage (see above at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff also pointed to the various acts of concealment on the part of the first defendant, such as the lack of publicity of the Furniture Rebates and the first defendant’s failure to tell its own conveyancing lawyers about the Furniture Rebates, to contend that first defendant had engaged in uncommercial conduct which was only explainable by reference to the first defendant’s participation in a plan to facilitate the disbursement of excess loans. However, these could just as readily be explained by the first defendant acting out of self-preservation to shield itself from the unlawful activities taking place downstream at the loan procurement stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Keeping the Furniture Rebates away from the public eye was also consistent with the first defendant’s awareness that some unlawful activities were going on behind the scenes in the loan application process, and hence its desire to stay out of the spotlight. I noted that there was correspondence between Ms Woo and the second defendant, in which Ms Woo expressed concerns that the second defendant’s proposed Stated Purchase Price for one of the Units was “too high to justify and will draw unnecessary attention”. The plaintiff argued that this meant that the first defendant was concerned about attracting unnecessary attention from the plaintiff.

</div> I did not think that this was what Ms Woo meant. Ms Woo stated her concerns in response to an earlier email sent by the second defendant, wherein he proposed fixing the Stated Purchase Price at a certain amount and claimed that “bank and valuation can match” that amount.

</div>
</div> Since the second defendant already explained that the proposed Stated Purchase Price was supported by bank valuation, it was unlikely that Ms Woo’s concern was about attracting additional scrutiny from the plaintiff. Ms Woo was simply worried about attracting attention from others in general, as she was aware that there were some unlawful activities involving the Purchasers and the second and third defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In a similar vein, it was plausible that the first defendant was merely distancing itself from any illegal activity occurring downstream in the loan procurement process, by keeping its own solicitors in the dark about the Furniture Rebates and taking the position that it received payment for the 4% Option Fee and 15% Completion Fee. It did not work in the first defendant’s interest for more people, including its own lawyers, to find out that it was involved in transactions where Purchasers had procured excess bank loans. It did not want to take responsibility for any misconduct by the second and third defendants in their dealings with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Hence, while the first defendant’s non-disclosure of the Furniture Rebates from its own solicitors, and omission to publicise the Furniture Rebates in general, had the effect of keeping the Purchasers’ deceit vis-à-vis the plaintiff under wraps, it did not necessarily mean that the first defendant had acted with the purpose of achieving that effect as part of a plan to facilitate the disbursement of excess loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As a final point for completeness, not much can be made of the coordination between the defendants in identifying tenanted Units to be sold to the Purchasers. The first defendant was merely acting on the demands of the Purchasers, who wanted tenanted Units (see above at [69]). Coordination in this regard was insufficient to sustain the inference that the first defendant was part of a broader scheme employing unlawful means.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Ultimately, taken singly or together, the various factors, were to my mind insufficient to show that the first defendant had combined with the other defendants. The behaviour of the first defendant could just as easily be explained as a willingness to go along with the purchase arrangements, without caring how the plaintiff was affected. As it was aware that unlawful activities were taking place downstream causing the plaintiff to disburse excess loans, it sought to keep the existence of this purchase arrangement under wraps to avoid being implicated in whatever that was going on between the Purchasers, the second defendant, the third defendant and the plaintiff. These might perhaps be sharp practice, but it would not on current law lead to tortious liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intention to injure</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The meaning of intention to injure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For a claim in unlawful means conspiracy to succeed, there must be combination, accompanied by the intention to injure by unlawful means. This intention to injure need not be the predominant intention: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings CA </span>at [96].

However, knowledge that a particular conduct would harm the claimant, would not by itself amount to an intention to injure. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> CA </span>at [101]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lesser states of mind, such as an appreciation that a course of conduct would inevitably harm the claimant, would not amount to an intention to injure, although it may be a factor supporting an inference of intention on the factual circumstances of the case. In <span class="font-italic">Lonrho plc v Fayed </span>[1990] 2 QB 479 at 488–489 Woolf LJ observed that the requisite intent (for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means) would be satisfied if the defendant fully appreciated that a course of conduct that he was embarking upon would have a particular consequence to a claimant but nonetheless decided to pursue that course of conduct; or if the defendant deliberately embarked upon a course of conduct while appreciating the probable consequences to the claimant. In our judgment, this is inconsistent with the requirement that intention must be shown. It is simply insufficient in seeking to meet the element of <span class="font-italic">intention</span> to show merely that there was knowledge to found an awareness of the likelihood of particular consequences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings CA </span>at [101] also stressed that it is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat and others v Ricwil (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1167 (“<span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat</span>”), a case cited by the plaintiff,

</div> the first appellant-defendant, Mr Chew, was a major shareholder and managing director of the respondent-plaintiff, Ricwil. Mr Chew was the managing director of the third appellant-defendant, Sintalow. In breach of his fiduciary duties, Mr Chew procured Sintalow to supply to another company the very goods that were to be supplied by Ricwil, and in doing so, arranged the contracts such that the burden was borne by Ricwil while the benefit was received by Sintalow (at [32]). The Court of Appeal held at [35] found that Mr Chew and Sintalow must have intended to injure Ricwil, because “the loss or damage to Ricwil was a necessary corollary of the profit accruing to Sintalow” and that “[t]here was a direct nexus between these events”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat</span> is not inconsistent with the holding in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings CA</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> In <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat </span>Mr Chew was effectively diverting a business contract from Ricwil to Sintalow. This meant that the conspirators not only knew that their benefit inevitably resulted in a loss to Ricwil, but also knew that damage had to be caused to Ricwil so that Sintalow to obtain its intended profits. In other words, the conspirators appreciated that the injury to Ricwil was a necessary step to Sintalow’s intended gain on the facts of that case, and therefore, Sintalow must have intended the injury to Ricwil.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The first defendant knew that the Purchasers would be obtaining loans in circumvention of the 80% LTV Limit and in excess of the Actual Purchase Price (see at [46] above). The question was whether it can be inferred from such knowledge, along with other pieces of evidence, that the first defendant intended to injure the plaintiff, be it by placing it in breach of MAS Notice 632 or causing it to bear the risk of default. For reasons similar to those given in relation to the absence of a combination involving the first defendant, the various assertions by the plaintiff, even when taken against the background of the quiet property market at the time, were to my mind insufficient to show any intention to injure the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The effect of the Furniture Rebate Plan was that it assisted the Purchasers in the procurement of excess loans. The first defendant knew of this effect, but there was insufficient evidence indicating that the first defendant had intended this effect. As mentioned at [47] above, the first defendant’s conduct could also be explained on the basis that it went along with the purchase arrangement without caring how the plaintiff was affected. The subsequent acts by the first defendant to keep the existence of the Furniture Rebates under wraps were also explicable on the basis that it was merely masking its own involvement in transactions where over-lending had occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 When faced with a claim in unlawful means conspiracy, a defendant cannot evade liability simply because its primary motive was to further or protect their own interests, where it has been shown that the conspirators intentionally injured the claimant: <span class="font-italic">Lonrho plc v Fayed</span> [1992] 1 AC 448 per Lord Bridge at 465-466, cited in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings CA </span>at [97] with approval. This is consistent with the principle that there is no need for the claimant to prove that the conspirators’ dominant intention was to cause injury to it; a mere intention to injure was sufficient. However, in the present case, it could not be inferred that the first defendant even had a mere intention to injure, as it was plausible that the first defendant was acting solely in its own interest without paying heed to how the first defendant would be impacted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiff argued that causing harm to the plaintiff was a “necessary corollary” of the first defendant’s disposal of its Units, and this was sufficient to establish the intention to injure, akin to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat</span>.

</div> As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings CA</span> at [101], even if harm to a claimant is an inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct, that would not suffice to prove an intention to injure. The present case was also distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat</span>. As explained, the conspirators in <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat </span>knew that the claimant had to be injured in order for it to obtain its intended benefit. Here, there was insufficient evidence showing that the first defendant knew that the plaintiff had to over-lend in order for it to sell the Units to the Purchasers. As I had found above at [66]–[69], it could not be inferred that the first defendant knew, or had blind-eye knowledge, of the Purchasers’ financial constraint. Without knowing that the plaintiff had to over-lend before was able to sell its Units, the first defendant could not have intended the injury to the plaintiff as a means to its end (see above at [79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I was therefore not convinced that the plaintiff had established, on a balance of probabilities, that the first defendant had the intention to injure the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unlawful means</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 One of the main unlawful means pointed to during the hearing and in further written submissions was the breach of the MAS Notice 632 and hence contravention of s 55 of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Banking Act”). The difficulty with this was that any such contravention would have to be by the plaintiff bank, and not the defendants.

In a previous decision, the Standby Facility was determined to be void for contravention of s 76(1A) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Companies Act”). The plaintiff in this case brought a claim against the defendants, which included Mr Fan, an officer of IHC, for their roles in causing it to enter into and draw down on the Standby Facility to purchase its own shares. One of the causes of action was the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. There were two unlawful means alleged. The first was the entry into and drawdowns on the Standby Facility in contravention of s 76(1A) of the Companies Act. The second was breaches of fiduciary duties by Mr Fan: <span class="font-italic">OUE Lippo</span> at [172].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">OUE Lippo</span> held that Mr Fan, and other defendants, had furthered their common object through procuring IHC’s entry into and subsequent drawdowns on the Standby Facility (at [189]).

Eventually, the High Court found that Mr Fan, and some of the other defendants, were liable for unlawful means conspiracy to injure IHC (at [335(d)]).

</div> s 76(5) of the Companies Act provides that if a company contravenes s 76(1A), the company shall not be guilty of an offence, but each officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence. In finding that the Standby Facility was in contravention of s 76(1A) of the Companies Act, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">OUE Lippo</span> in effect held that Mr Fan had committed an offence under the Companies Act in addition to having breached his fiduciary duties. As IHC, the plaintiff-victim in this case, was not guilty of an offence, the decision in <span class="font-italic">OUE Lippo</span> did not support the plaintiff’s proposition that that “unlawful means” extend to infringements of statutory provisions by the plaintiff-victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance</span> also involved a breach of the prohibition against financial assistance. Through the agreement of 3 October 1963 (the “contract”), the plaintiff company provided financial assistance to one Mr Grosscurth, one of the defendants, to acquire the plaintiff company’s own share capital. This was in contravention of s 54 of the Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK) (the “UK Companies Act”), which contains the prohibition against financial assistance. Notably, s 54 of the UK Companies Act penalises the company and every officer of the company who is in default.

None of the defendants could have infringed the prohibition because they were not officers of the plaintiff company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 However, Buckley LJ in <span class="font-italic">Belmont Finance</span> did not hold that the plaintiff company’s infringement of s 54 of the UK Companies Act constituted the unlawful means through which the conspiracy was effected. Buckley LJ (with whom Goff LJ and Waller LJ agreed) found that the acts which the defendants had combined to carry out were the acts of entering into the contract, procuring the plaintiff to enter into the contract, and ensuring that the contract was implemented. This is apparent from the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the way in which Buckley LJ had framed the issues, as well as his holding. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the contract was in contravention of s 54 of the UK Companies Act, and that the defendants conspired to carry that contract into effect, causing it to suffer damage (at 400).

</div> However, the tort is one of unlawful means, not unlawful consequences. The defendants’ actions might expose the plaintiff bank to possible regulatory action or prosecution, but these were not actionable under the conspiracy to cause harm by unlawful means. I could see no reason to extend the tort to the acts complained of, and it was not strongly contended for anyway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff also relied on the allegations of deceit as unlawful means, namely, the Purchase Price Misrepresentations, Identity Misrepresentations, Financial Standing Fraud and Payment Misrepresentations. The first three acts of deceit were allegedly committed by the second and third defendants, whilst the last act of deceit was allegedly committed by the first defendant. These would in principal count as unlawful means, but the plaintiff would need to show that the other elements were fulfilled as well, in order to succeed in its claim in conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unlawful acts done in furtherance of combination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It is not enough that there is a combination or agreement, and that some unlawful means were used to cause harm. There must be a link between the combination and the unlawful means to clothe all the participants with liability. In this regard, there was insufficient evidence to my mind to establish that there was any combination involving the first defendant to cause harm to the plaintiff in any of these modes of deceit. Even if the acts were done by the second and third defendants in furtherance of the conspiracy, I did not find that there was any common design in any of the alleged acts of deceit committed by the second and third defendants that would have involved the first defendant. Even if I were to accept the various assertions made by the plaintiff as showing the existence of a combination which the first defendant was a part of, that would still not show that there was any such combination to employ deceit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Assuming the first defendant had agreed with the other two defendants that it would sell units to purchasers who it knew were financially constrained and were mere nominees,

</div> there was no evidence indicating that the first defendant was aware that 28 Purchasers were making false representations as to the true identity of the buyers. Neither was there evidence demonstrating the first defendant’s knowledge that monies were being recycled amongst the Purchasers’ accounts to portray the impression that the Purchasers had good financial standing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 There is no need for an alleged conspirator to know what the others have agreed to do. However, an alleged conspirator must, at the very least, know that those acts were being carried before it could sensibly be said to be part of a combination to commit the same. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">CA</span> at [114], “[i]t is meaningless to speak of an agreement or combination in the absence of a common understanding of the material facts being shared by all the alleged conspirators”.

The first defendant’s willingness to go along with these arrangements could just as well be explained by its indifference to the dealings as between the Purchasers and the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Harm or damage caused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I was doubtful that the conspiracy claim would be made out on the basis that the Housing Loans were made on something other than what was the “true price”.

These representations were in fact made by the second defendant, who supplied the transaction details, including the purchase price of the Units.

</div> Such payment assured the plaintiff that the Purchaser had the financial means to service the Housing Loan, created a buffer between the amount of the Housing Loan and the purchase price of the property which would cushion the plaintiff against a fall in value of the property should the plaintiff need to realise its security, and the Housing Loan had to be disbursed in compliance with MAS Notice 632.

This was because at any prior time the disbursement process could be stopped, and the cashier’s order returned to the plaintiff and cancelled without loss. Form 3 was a document filled in by PKWA and submitted to the plaintiff to request for the preparation of the cashier’s order. As Form 3 merely kickstarted the process for the preparation of the cashier’s orders, it was irrelevant to the issue of reliance. At the time of completion, PKWA, on behalf of the plaintiff, handed over the cashier’s orders to TSMP only upon TSMP’s confirmation that the Balance Purchase Price had been made, as set out in the TSMP Letters.

</div> Ms Ang’s and Ms Tan’s evidence collectively demonstrated that the TSMP Letter, and the Payment Misrepresentations contained therein, did not play any part in inducing the plaintiff to authorise the disbursement of the Housing Loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Ms Ang’s and Ms Tan’s evidence cohered with the plaintiff’s Standard Mortgage Policies, wherein the plaintiff expressly stated that it would rely on its lawyer’s confirmations in Form 3 to disburse the loans. Clause 9.2(ii) of the Standard Mortgage Policies read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Upon the Bank’s receipt of your advice/instructions for disbursement or implementation of the Facilities or any part thereof, <span class="font-italic">the Bank will forthwith proceed with the disbursement or implementation of the Facilities or any part thereof in full reliance of</span> your professional advice/instructions, <span class="font-italic">your confirmations furnished in</span> the relevant completed Form 1LM, Form 2ROT and <span class="font-italic">Form 3</span> and in full reliance and on the understanding that all the aforesaid duties shall have already been discharged by you prior to such advice/instructions for disbursement or implementation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Form 3 contained a corresponding acknowledgment from PKWA that the plaintiff would proceed with the disbursement “in full reliance” of PKWA’s confirmations furnished in Form 3. Form 3 confirmed, amongst other matters, that payment of the Balance Purchase Price had been made (Clause 6(a)(ii)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 It was also telling that cashier’s orders for four of the Purchasers were issued before the date of the relevant TSMP Letters for these Purchasers. In contrast, all 38 cashier’s orders were issued after the receipt by the plaintiff of the relevant Form 3.

</div> In fact, in Theodora’s case, TSMP did not issue any letter to PKWA expressly confirming that the first defendant had received a cheque or direct payment of the 15% Completion Fee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In so far as Theodora was concerned, Ms Ang initially took the position that she had inferred, from the fact that the first defendant was willing to proceed to completion, that the 15% Completion Fee had been paid by Theodora.

</div> She confirmed that the Housing Loan for Theodora was disbursed upon receipt of, and in reliance on, Form 3 from PKWA, just like all the other 37 Purchasers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I therefore find that the TSMP Letters did not play a role in inducing the plaintiff to authorise the disbursement of the Housing Loans to each of the 38 Purchasers. Rather, Form 3 was the document which the plaintiff had relied on. For completeness, I note that there was no direct evidence from PKWA as to what it had relied on to issue the confirmation in Form 3. Most of the Form 3s were issued prior to the TSMP Letters.

</div> In other words, the Housing Loan was deemed to have been disbursed when the cashier’s order was issued. As set out above, the cashier’s order was issued on the back of PKWA’s confirmation in Form 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In oral submissions, counsel for the plaintiff argued that parties could not have intended for the Housing Loans to be disbursed at the point in time when the cashier’s orders were issued. Otherwise, the Housing Loan would effectively become an unsecured loan, as completion would not have taken place then.

</div> However, as counsel for the first defendant rightly pointed out, Clause 2.1 of the Standard Mortgage Policies obliged the plaintiff’s lawyers to lodge a caveat against the mortgaged property. The caveat afforded the plaintiff a measure of protection between the time of the cashier’s order was issued and the time of completion.
