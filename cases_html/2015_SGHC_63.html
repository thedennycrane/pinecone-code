<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This dispute is between the Arab Banking
                    Corporation (“ABC”) and its customer, Boustead Singapore Limited
                    (“Boustead”). ABC is a Bahrain bank and Boustead is a Singapore
                    public-listed infrastructure company that is involved in construction
                    developments internationally. The dispute arises out of credit facilities that
                    ABC extended to Boustead for a construction project in Libya. The central issue
                    is whether Boustead is required to pay ABC sums of money that ABC alleges are
                    due pursuant to ABC’s demand under a credit facilities agreement
                    (“the FA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In 2007, Boustead, acting through a joint
                    venture (“the JV”) with a Libyan company, was employed by the
                    Organisation for Development of Administrative Centres (“ODAC”) to
                    construct a housing development in Al-Marj, a city in north-eastern Libya. While
                    it does appear that one of Boustead’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, and not
                    Boustead, was the actual party to the JV,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> this
                    distinction is immaterial for present purposes and I will not address it
                    further. According to Boustead, ODAC was a Libyan entity involved in public
                    projects throughout the country and was controlled by the regime of the late
                    Muammar Muhammad Abu Minya al-Gaddafi, better known as Muammar
                Gaddafi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The JV’s contract with ODAC (“the
                    Public Works Contract”) was on ODAC’s standard terms. The Public
                    Works Contract required the JV to furnish a performance bond (“the
                    PB”) and an advance-payment guarantee (“the APG”) in favour
                    of ODAC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The issuance of the PB and APG in favour of ODAC
                    was done through two intermediary banks. First, Boustead instructed ABC to issue
                    two counter-guarantees in favour of a Libyan bank, the Bank of Commerce and
                    Development (“BCD”). I shall refer to these counter-guarantees as
                    “CG38” and “CG39”, or collectively as “the
                    CGs”. Second, ABC instructed BCD to issue the PB and APG in favour of
                    ODAC against the issuance of the CGs in BCD’s favour. The sums
                    counter-guaranteed under CG38 and CG39 corresponded with the sums guaranteed
                    under the PB and APG respectively. They were, to that extent, granted on a
                    back-to-back basis. At the material time, both CG38 and the PB secured the sum
                    of US$3,760,387.95 and expired on 28 July 2011. CG39 and the APG secured
                    the sum of US$15,021,093.25 and expired on 30 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The CGs, the PB and APG were demand guarantees
                    (also known as on-demand guarantees or demand bonds). All required payment on
                    demand as opposed to payment on proof of loss, although each instrument had
                    different requirements for a valid demand for payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Boustead’s banking relationship with ABC
                    was governed by the FA. Under the FA, Boustead was obliged to reimburse or
                    indemnify ABC on ABC’s first demand for any amounts demanded or paid under
                    the CGs. The FA stipulated that any demand from ABC was to be conclusive
                    evidence of the amount owing from Boustead to ABC under the FA.</p>

                    their relation to each other is set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unrest in Libya</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Unrest broke out in Libya in 2011 while the
                    Al-Marj construction project was still underway. The unrest bloomed into a
                    full-scale civil war. According to Boustead, the Al-Marj project site was looted
                    and pillaged. Boustead’s plant and equipment was destroyed.
                    Boustead’s staff was evacuated from the Al-Marj project site, and
                    subsequently from Libya on 23 February 2011 with the assistance of
                    International SOS. The United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”)
                    passed Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) on 26 February and
                    17 March 2011 respectively, imposing asset freezes on the assets of Muammar
                    Gaddafi, his inner circle, and entities under their control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Boustead took the position that the Public Works
                    Contract was discharged by the war and subsequent evacuation of Boustead’s
                    staff from the Al-Marj project site. Boustead wrote to ODAC on 13 June 2011
                    stating that a <em>force majeure</em> event had occurred,
                    and that the JV was no longer required to perform its obligations under the
                    Public Works Contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It is in this context that the
                    dispute currently before the court began to take root.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Notices or demands in respect of the PB or APG and the CGs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After unrest in Libya broke out in early 2011,
                    various notices or demands were sent by ODAC to BCD and by BCD to ABC in respect
                    of the PB and CG38 and the APG and CG39. I will set out the sequence in respect
                    of the APG and CG39 first and then the sequence in respect of the PB and
                    CG38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 25 May 2011, after Boustead’s
                    staff had been evacuated from Libya, BCD sent a Society for Worldwide Interbank
                    Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) message to ABC. (SWIFT
                    messages were the primary mode of communication between ABC and BCD, and unless
                    I mention to the contrary, any communication or correspondence between ABC and
                    BCD was by SWIFT message.) BCD requested that the expiry of CG39 be extended to
                    31 December 2012, or that the full sum secured under CG39 be
                        paid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first extend or liquidate request from BCD
                    to ABC was followed by a second on 20 June 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> On 23 June 2011, BCD
                    made a demand on ABC for payment under CG39 (“the CG39
                        Demand”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> ABC
                    informed Boustead of the CG39 Demand on the same day. As it turned out, Boustead
                    had commenced Originating Summons No 503 of 2011
                    (“OS 503/2011”) against ABC on 22 June 2011. Boustead
                    obtained an <em>ex parte</em> injunction restraining ABC
                    from extending the validity of or making payments under the CGs on 23 June
                    2011, perhaps before having knowledge of the CG39 Demand already made on ABC.
                    Boustead wrote to ABC on 23 June 2011 informing the latter of the
                        injunction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> ABC
                    relayed the message to BCD on 28 June 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     BCD adopted the same approach in respect of
                    CG38 notwithstanding the injunction restraining ABC from making payment under
                    both CGs. BCD sent ABC a first extend or liquidate request for CG38 on
                    30 June 2011,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    followed by a second request on 3 July 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On 11 July 2011, BCD made a
                    demand on ABC for payment under CG38 (“the CG38
                        Demand”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The basis of both the CG38 and CG39 Demands
                    were stated by BCD to be demands from ODAC under the PB and APG respectively.
                    When Boustead was informed of the earlier CG39 Demand, it asked ABC to provide a
                    copy of the ODAC demand on which the CG39 Demand was based. ABC relayed
                    Boustead’s request to BCD. BCD obliged, and on 14 July 2011 (which
                    was after the CG38 Demand had been made), BCD sent to ABC copies of both the
                    purported demands from ODAC which formed the basis for BCD’s CG38 and CG39
                        Demands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These turned out to be letters from
                    ODAC to BCD dated 16 May and 19 June 2011. I shall refer to them as
                    “the ODAC Notices”. ABC forwarded copies of the ODAC Notices to
                    Boustead on 18 July 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proceedings in Singapore gain momentum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It will be recalled that Boustead commenced
                    OS 503/2011 and obtained an <em>ex parte</em>
                    injunction restraining ABC from making payment to BCD under the CGs on
                    23 June 2011. On 24 April 2012, ABC successfully challenged the
                    jurisdiction of the Singapore court in OS 503/2011 before an assistant
                    registrar. This was about ten months after the injunction was first granted. The
                    assistant registrar set aside the order granting leave for service of the
                    originating process out of jurisdiction, but did not discharge the injunction.
                    Boustead appealed against the assistant registrar’s decision. A judge of
                    the High Court dismissed the appeal on 29 August 2012 on the ground that
                    Boustead had commenced the action with an incorrect originating process. The
                    judge also discharged the injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Boustead commenced Suit No 730 of 2012
                    (“S 730/2012”) against ABC the next day, on 30 August
                    2012. Boustead also made an <em>ex parte</em> application
                    for a second interim injunction to the same effect as the first. The second
                    injunction was granted on the same day by the same judge who had discharged the
                    first injunction. In S 730/2012, Boustead seeks a declaration that it is
                    discharged from all liabilities and obligations to ABC under the FA insofar as
                    they relate to the CGs. Boustead also seeks a permanent injunction restraining
                    ABC from making payment to BCD under the CGs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     While proceedings in Singapore were unfolding,
                    ABC continued to receive requests from BCD to extend or liquidate the CGs. On
                    23 August 2012, BCD wrote to ABC stating that ODAC requested an extension
                    or liquidation of the APG. In the same message, BCD further stated that if an
                    extension was not forthcoming, BCD “shall be grateful ... if [ABC] would
                    consider this SWIFT as an official claim for liquidation of the value of
                        [CG39]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> ABC
                    responded on 27 August 2012 acknowledging BCD’s message, and
                    reminding BCD of the injunction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">ABC makes a demand on the FA and issues an event-of-default
                notice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 3 September 2012, ABC made a
                    consolidated demand for payment of US$18,781,481.20 under the FA. I shall refer
                    to this as “the FA Demand”. The FA Demand was for the aggregate of
                    the sums demanded by BCD under the CGs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The FA Demand was made more
                    than a year after BCD’s demands for payment under the CGs. An injunction
                    restraining ABC from making payment to BCD under the CGs was and still continues
                    to be in place from when it was first granted on 23 June 2011 (save for the
                    narrow one-day window when the first injunction was discharged, which is
                    described at [15]–[16] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Boustead responded to ABC’s FA Demand by
                    email on 4 September 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The email reminded ABC that
                    it was restrained from making payment under the CGs. The email also set out
                    Boustead’s position that it disputed the validity of the CG Demands and
                    the ODAC Notices, and that Boustead would not be making any payment to
                    ABC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     ABC responded by serving an event-of-default
                    notice (“the EOD Notice”) on Boustead under the FA on
                    10 September 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The ground for the EOD Notice was
                    that ABC had not received payment from Boustead. ABC’s position is that
                    the EOD Notice terminated the FA with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     ABC subsequently commenced Suit No 784 of
                    2012 (“S 784/2012”) on 19 September 2012, claiming the
                    sums due under the FA Demand, or alternatively, seeking a declaration that
                    Boustead is liable to pay ABC on the sums demanded in the FA Demand. ABC also
                    seeks the discharge of the second injunction restraining payment to BCD. The
                    trial before me was for the two consolidated suits, S 730/2012 and
                    S 784/2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There was also some further correspondence
                    between ABC and BCD in 2012. These were mainly updates from ABC to BCD on the
                    legal proceedings in Singapore. ABC on two occasions invited BCD to instruct
                    counsel in Singapore and to be joined as defendants to the Singapore
                    proceedings. BCD twice declined. This correspondence will be addressed in
                    greater detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It will be helpful to provide an outline of
                    the terms of the relevant agreements before turning to the various allegations
                    and claims. I will give only a brief overview of the agreements in this section.
                    I will discuss them in greater detail as and when necessary in the course of my
                    analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The FA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The FA is an agreement between ABC and
                    Boustead. The FA comprises two documents: a facility agreement dated 4 July
                    2008; and a supplemental facility agreement dated 27 July 2009, which
                    varied the terms of the earlier facility agreement. It is needless to draw a
                    distinction between these two documents. Any reference to “the FA”
                    is to the original facility agreement as varied by the supplemental facility
                    agreement. The FA is governed by Singapore law. There are three provisions in
                    the FA that are relevant to these proceedings, cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 6.6 provides that
                        Boustead is to indemnify ABC against any loss it might suffer with respect
                        to the issuance of the CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 6.8 states that ABC shall not have any
                        obligation to make factual determinations as to the validity or genuineness
                        of any document delivered to it under the CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause 6.9 requires Boustead to
                        “reimburse and/or indemnify [ABC] for any amounts demanded or paid
                        under [the CGs]”. The reimbursement or indemnity is to be provided
                        “upon [ABC’s] demand (which demand shall, in the absence of
                        manifest error, be conclusive evidence of the amount
                            owing)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                        Clause 6.9 further states that Boustead’s obligation to pay the
                        amounts demanded by ABC “shall be absolute and unconditional
                        irrespective of any ... disputes of [Boustead] concerning the merits or
                        validity or propriety of any such demands or claims or any payment
                            made”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                        The FA Demand (see [18] above) was made pursuant to
                    cl 6.9.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The CGs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The CGs are demand guarantees that were issued
                    by ABC in favour of BCD. They were issued by ABC in accordance with
                    Boustead’s instructions and pursuant to the FA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The CGs were concluded through SWIFT messages
                    between ABC and BCD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The terms of both are largely
                    similar. Both are stipulated to be “subject to the [ICC] uniform rules
                    for demand guarantees ... and ... as to matters not governed by the uniform
                    rules ... be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.”
                    This is accepted to be a reference to the International Chamber of Commerce
                    Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (ICC Publication No 458) (“URDG
                    458”). Disputes arising from the CGs are also to be submitted to the
                    non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Both CGs contain the same requirements for a
                    conforming demand for payment. A demand for payment under the CGs must have a
                    supporting written statement specifying that BCD had received a demand for
                    payment from ODAC in accordance with the terms of the PB or APG, as the case may
                    be. These requirements will be examined below in the analysis of whether
                    BCD’s demands for payment under the CGs on ABC were conforming
                    demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The PB and APG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     BCD granted the PB and APG in favour of ODAC
                    against the CGs. Both the PB and APG are in Arabic, but English translations of
                    the documents were made available for the purposes of the trial. The terms of
                    both the PB and APG are largely similar. Both are demand guarantees and are
                    stipulated to be governed by Libyan law and subject to the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the Libyan courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Clause 2 of the PB requires a demand for
                    payment from ODAC to state:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> (a) the amount that was due
                    to ODAC; (b) that Boustead was in breach of its obligations under the Public
                    Works Contract; and (c) the respect in which Boustead was in
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the same vein, cl 2 of the APG
                    requires a demand for payment from ODAC to state:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> (a) that Boustead has failed
                    to repay the advance payment in accordance with the conditions of the Public
                    Works Contract; and (b) the amount which the JV has failed to
                repay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments and issues</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Boustead’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Boustead’s main contention is that it
                    should be discharged from all obligations owed to ABC under the FA that are in
                    relation to the CGs. This contention is made on four separate grounds: fraud,
                    conspiracy, unconscionability and contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Boustead’s fraud argument is that
                    ABC’s claim against Boustead is dishonest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> because it has “no basis in
                    fact and ... law”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Boustead’s allegation of
                    dishonesty has two separate bases: first, ABC turned a blind eye to the fraud
                    perpetrated by BCD, ODAC, or both, against Boustead;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> or second, ABC turned a
                    blind eye to the lack of authority, validity, genuineness, accuracy or
                    correctness of BCD’s demands for payment under the CGs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Boustead’s conspiracy argument is that
                    there are circumstances which show that ABC conspired with BCD, ODAC, or both,
                    to perpetrate a fraud on Boustead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Boustead’s unconscionability argument is
                    that the CG Demands and ODAC Notices were made or issued unconscionably. The FA
                    Demand was therefore also made unconscionably. ABC should accordingly be
                    precluded from claiming for the demanded sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Boustead’s contract argument is cast in
                    two ways. First, that cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA are unreasonable
                    exclusions of liability for negligence and therefore invalid under the Unfair
                    Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the UCTA”). Second,
                    that there were implied terms in the FA that ABC will not make a demand against
                    Boustead unless there have been valid or genuine claims made under the
                    CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">ABC’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     ABC does not dispute the proposition that
                    fraud on its part will disentitle it from seeking payment under cl 6.9 of
                    the FA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> ABC’s position is that Boustead
                    has not crossed the high threshold required to establish fraud. In the first
                    place, BCD’s demands were valid and sufficient to trigger ABC’s
                    liability to pay BCD under the CGs. ABC’s claim against Boustead was
                    therefore not made fraudulently. ABC argues that the FA Demand was not made
                    unconscionably, and that this aspect of unconscionability was, in any event, not
                    pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the contract ground, ABC argues that
                    cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA (see [24] above) are not exclusions of
                    liability for negligence. Even if they are, they are valid because they pass
                    muster under the reasonableness test in the UCTA. ABC disputes the existence of
                    the implied terms which Boustead contends for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the context of the positions described
                    above, the following issues arise for determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether ABC’s claim against
                        Boustead is brought fraudulently with no basis in fact or law
                        because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       BCD made the CG Demands
                            fraudulently and ABC had knowledge of BCD’s fraud;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       BCD’s CG Demands were invalid for failing to conform to the
                            requirements stipulated in the CGs and ABC had knowledge of such
                            non-conformity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether ABC conspired with BCD, ODAC, or both to
                        perpetrate a fraud on Boustead.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether ABC’s claim against Boustead is precluded
                        by terms that are implied in the FA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The latter two contract issues fall squarely
                    to be decided under Singapore law, which is the proper law of the
                FA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The fraud issue is also to be decided under
                    Singapore law. ABC’s claim is brought in Singapore under the FA that is
                    governed by Singapore law. The fraud issue, however, raises subsidiary issues
                    that may engage elements of foreign law. ABC’s legal position with respect
                    to BCD under the CGs is a question of English law. The validity of BCD’s
                    demands under the CGs would therefore have to be determined according to English
                    law. Libyan law, which is the proper law of the PB and APG, may also be
                    applicable. It would be relevant to the extent that the validity of the ODAC
                    Notices are in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Determining whether there is a conspiracy or
                    unconscionability will also require an examination of the entire context,
                    including the positions of the parties under the CGs, the PB and APG, as well as
                    the Public Works Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Three experts on foreign law were called to
                    give evidence at the trial. Stuart Isaacs QC and Sir Royston Miles Goode QC (who
                    is also known as Professor Roy Goode, and was referred to as Sir Roy during
                    the trial) were called by Boustead and ABC respectively to give evidence on
                    English law. Mr Isaacs is a commercial silk at the English bar with over 30
                    years of experience in practice. Sir Roy is an emeritus professor of law at the
                    University of Oxford and an emeritus fellow of St John’s College,
                    Oxford. The third expert was Mohamed Abdulkader Tumi. Dr Tumi was called by
                    Boustead to give evidence on Libyan law. Dr Tumi is a Libyan lawyer who has
                    been admitted to appear before the Libyan Supreme Court for more than 15
                        years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> ABC elected not to call a
                    Libyan law expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether ABC’s claim against Boustead is fraudulent </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Boustead asserts that ABC’s claim is
                    fraudulent because it has “no basis in fact and in
                        law”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Boustead’s argument
                    is that ABC makes the claim against Boustead despite ABC knowing that it does
                    not have any liability to BCD under the CGs because: (a) BCD made the CG Demands
                    fraudulently; or (b) the CG Demands were not made in conformity with the terms
                    of the CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     BCD’s demands for payment under the CGs
                    are said to be fraudulent because both the CG38 and CG39 Demands
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]e hereby support our demand by our written statement specifying that
                            <em>we have received a demand for payment under the above
                            advance payment guarantee in accordance with</em> [its] <em>terms</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is clear that the ODAC Notices which formed the basis of
                        the CG38 and CG39 Demands were not made in accordance with the terms of the
                        PB and APG (see [68]–[69] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Dr Tumi, Boustead’s Libyan law
                    expert, gave unchallenged evidence that under Libyan law (which is the governing
                    law of the PB and APG), the ODAC Notices did not constitute valid demands in
                    accordance with the terms of the PB and APG. The ODAC Notices would therefore
                    not have triggered BCD’s liability to ODAC under the PB and
                        APG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The CG Demands therefore made false statements
                    that BCD had “received ... demand[s] for payment ... in accordance with
                    [the] terms [of the PB or APG, as the case may be]”. Boustead argues that
                    BCD made the false statements knowing they were false, or recklessly, without
                    caring as to its truth or falsity. BCD was therefore acting fraudulently in
                    making the CG Demands. Boustead also alleges that BCD’s demands were
                    themselves, non-compliant with the terms of the CGs. These allegations of
                    non-compliance are detailed, and I will address them further
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As a preliminary point, I address ABC’s
                    submission that Boustead did not plead that ABC made a fraudulent claim against
                    Boustead. ABC argues that Boustead merely stated that ABC’s commencement
                    of S 784/2012 was a “wrongful act”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> While Boustead’s
                    pleadings are convoluted, it is my view that the allegation is sufficiently
                    pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In paragraph 48 of Boustead’s
                    amended statement of claim, Boustead avers that ABC has committed a
                    “wrongful act” against Boustead. At sub-paragraph (i) of the
                    particulars to paragraph 48, Boustead refers to ABC having turned a blind
                    eye to ODAC’s or BCD’s fraud, or to the lack of validity of
                    documents which include a reference to the ODAC Notices and the CG Demands. It
                    is not necessary to allege in the pleading that turning a blind eye amounts to
                    fraud. The factual allegation has been made. With that, I will turn to the
                    evidence on English law in respect of demand guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">English law on demand guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The English law experts, Mr Isaacs for
                    Boustead and Sir Roy for ABC, each filed an expert report on the English law
                    applicable to demand guarantees. This was followed by a joint expert report that
                    was filed pursuant to a direction by the court. After the joint expert report
                    was filed, each expert filed a supplementary report that addressed various areas
                    of disagreement in the first round of reports and the later joint
                report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The experts agreed that three fundamental
                    principles of demand guarantee law were applicable:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the demand guarantee is
                        autonomous from the counter-guarantee, which is, in turn autonomous from the
                        underlying contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the issuer of a demand guarantee (or counter-guarantee) is
                        concerned with documents and not external facts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the issuer of a demand guarantee
                        (or counter-guarantee) is only concerned with apparent
                    conformity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     These three principles also find expression in
                    the URDG 458 which was incorporated into the CGs. Article 2(b) of the URDG 458
                    states that the duty of a guarantor under a guarantee (or counter-guarantee) is
                    to pay the sum stated on the presentation of a written demand for payment and
                    other documents specified in the guarantee, which appear on their face to be in
                    accordance with the terms of the guarantee. Article 2(c) stipulates the same
                    conditions in relation to payments on counter-guarantees. It further states that
                    counter-guarantees are by their nature separate transactions from the guarantees
                    to which they relate and from any underlying contract. Counter-guarantors are in
                    no way concerned with or bound by such guarantees or contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The principle of autonomy posits that the
                    underlying contract (in this case, the Public Works Contract) is independent
                    from the guarantee (in this case, the PB and APG issued by BCD in favour of
                    ODAC). The guarantee is, in turn, independent from the counter-guarantee (in
                    this case, the CGs issued by ABC in favour of BCD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The corollary of the principle of autonomy is
                    the second principle that the issuer is concerned with documents and not
                    external facts. This means that the guarantor or counter-guarantor pays against
                        <em>and only against</em> a demand for payment
                    accompanied by the presentation of specified documents. Precisely what is
                    required of a conforming demand for payment depends on the terms of the
                    guarantee under which the demand is made. Apart from the conformity of the
                    demand or documents, the guarantor or counter-guarantor is not concerned with
                    the truth or accuracy of the statements contained within those
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Closely related is the third
                    principle—that of apparent conformity. Under this principle, the guarantor
                    or counter-guarantor is concerned only with whether documents presented appear
                    on their face to conform to the terms of the guarantee or counter-guarantee, as
                    the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The effect of these principles is that ABC
                    will be under an obligation to pay on the demands made by BCD under the CGs as
                    long as BCD’s demands conform with the requirements of the CGs and the
                    URDG 458. Payment must be made regardless of how unfair it may be in the
                    circumstances: see <em>Edward Owen Engineering Limited v Barclays
                        Bank International Limited</em> [1978] QB 159 (“<em>Edward Owen v Barclays Bank</em>”) at
                169.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The thread that ties these three principles
                    together, despite the possible unfairness of payment on demand, is the
                    commercial role that a demand guarantee serves. Demand guarantees under English
                    law are treated as the equivalent of cash; they provide a promptly and assuredly
                    realisable security when the prescribed event occurs: <em>Siporex
                        Trade SA v Banque Indosuez</em> [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 146 at
                    158.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The only exception (under English law) that
                    unravels the tight weave of the three principles described above is fraud. In
                        <em>Edward Owen v Barclays Bank</em>, Lord Denning MR
                    stated at 169 that the bank “ought not to pay under the credit if it
                        <em>knows</em> that the documents are forged or that
                    the request for payment is <em>made fraudulently</em> in
                    circumstances when there is no right to payment” [emphasis added]. A bank
                    may (or on some authorities, must: see <em>United City Merchants
                        (Investments) Ltd and Glass Fibres and Equipment Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada
                        and others</em> [1983] 1 AC 168) refuse to pay on a demand where: (a)
                    the beneficiary to the guarantee (or counter-guarantee) is a party to the fraud;
                    (b) the bank has knowledge of the fraud by a particular time; and (c) the
                    beneficiary has been given an opportunity to answer the allegation of
                    fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The English law experts also agreed that there
                    is a relatively high evidential threshold in order for the fraud exception to be
                    made out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Various phrases have been used by the
                    English courts to describe this standard:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     “clearly established”
                        in <em>Edward Owen v Barclays Bank</em> at
                    173;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     “particularly cogent evidence” in <em>Enka
                            Insaat Ve Sanayi AS v Banca Popolare dell'Alto Adige SpA</em>
                        [2009] EWHC 2410 (Comm) at [25]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     “the only realistic inference” in <em>United Trading Corporation SA and Murray Clayton Ltd v Allied
                            Arab Bank Ltd and others</em> [1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 554 at
                        561 (“<em>United
                    Trading</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     One must be careful, however, not to overstate
                    the narrowness of the fraud exception. The English Court of Appeal observed in
                        <em>United Trading</em> at 561:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t cannot be in the interests of international commerce or of the
                        banking community as a whole that this important machinery that is provided
                        for traders should be misused for the purposes of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I have laid out the English law on demand
                    guarantees broadly. I now turn to consider whether BCD’s demands under the
                    CGs were made fraudulently, or were invalid because they did not conform to the
                    terms of the CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether BCD made the CG Demands fraudulently and if so whether ABC
                had knowledge of the fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The fraud exception requires establishing
                    first, that BCD made the demands under the CGs fraudulently; and second, that
                    ABC had knowledge of BCD’s fraud at the relevant time. The experts
                    differed on when exactly this relevant time was.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether BCD made the CG38 and CG39 Demands fraudulently</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It is not disputed that the statements made by
                    BCD in the CG Demands, that BCD had received demands from ODAC in accordance
                    with the terms of the PB and APG, were false. The ODAC Notices clearly did not
                    comply with the terms of the PB and APG. But the mere fact that BCD made false
                    statements in the CG38 and CG39 Demands does not, without more, amount to
                    fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The classic statement of fraud is found in the
                    English House of Lords case of <em>Derry v Peek</em> (1889)
                    14 App Cas 337 (“<em>Derry v Peek</em>”).
                    Lord Herschell stated at 374 that fraud is proved when a false representation
                    has been made either <em>knowingly</em>, without belief in
                    its truth, or <em>recklessly</em>, careless as to whether
                    it be true or false. Fraud therefore requires that BCD made the false statements
                    in the CG Demands either knowing that they were false, or recklessly without
                    caring as to their truth or falsity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The English law experts both expressed views
                    on whether the evidence would lead to the conclusion that BCD was acting
                    fraudulently, but they did so with reticence. Both maintained that it was not
                    for them to say whether or not there was fraud on the part of BCD. That is a
                    question of fact which is the sole province of the trier of fact and not an
                    expert witness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Nevertheless, Mr Isaacs did say that
                    there was a good arguable case of fraud in the sense of recklessness, based on a
                    few factors stated in his expert opinion:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     BCD would have drafted the PB and
                        the APG and so, would have been aware of the requirements (described at
                        [29]–[30] above) for a valid demand under the PB and the
                    APG.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        requirements for a valid demand under the PB and the APG were very short and
                        straightforward.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     The ODAC Notices were very obviously non-compliant with the
                        requirements of the PB and the APG. There was no reference in either letter
                        to any failure to pay or other breach of the underlying Public Works
                        Contract by Boustead or the JV.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_d"></a>(d)     It would be surprising if BCD had not sought to check
                        that it had received valid demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_e"></a>(e)     ABC had informed BCD that the latter’s initial
                        demand under CG39 dated 20 June 2011 was non-compliant because it did
                        not contain a statement specifying that it had received a demand under the
                        APG in accordance with its terms. (I will elaborate more on this point
                        below.)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_f"></a>(f)     There
                        was no evidence of communication between BCD and ODAC which suggests that
                        BCD attempted to establish that the requirements for demands under the PB
                        and the APG had been met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Sir Roy, on the other hand, expressed the
                    view that the circumstances above did not necessarily lead to the conclusion
                    that there was fraud. There were other equally credible possibilities that
                    amounted to mere negligence or carelessness, but not recklessness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Considering the evidence as a whole, it is my
                    view that the “only realistic inference” (<em>United Trading</em> at 560) that can be drawn is that BCD made the
                    false statements in the CG38 and CG39 Demands recklessly. I base this conclusion
                    on four reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     First, the ODAC Notices were obviously
                    non-compliant with the terms of the PB and APG. It bears repeating that
                    cl 2 of the PB required a demand from ODAC under the PB to state:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     the amount that was due to
                        ODAC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the
                        JV was in breach of its obligations stipulated in the Public Works Contract;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)     the respect
                        in which the JV was in breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 2 of the APG required a demand from ODAC under the APG to
                        state:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_d"></a>(d)     that the
                        JV has failed to repay the advance payment in accordance with the conditions
                        of the Public Works Contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_e"></a>(e)     the amount which the JV has failed to
                    repay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The ODAC Notices, which related to the PB and
                    the APG were similar in all material respects. Both ODAC Notices merely
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]e hope from you to extend the validity term [<em>sic</em>] of the above described guarantee ... or to liquefy the
                        value of the said bound in favor of our [account].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The ODAC Notices did not satisfy <em>any</em> of the requirements for a valid demand under the PB and
                        APG. The non-conformity of the ODAC Notices would have been apparent to
                        anyone that read and considered what was required in the PB and APG against
                        what was stated in the ODAC Notices. It is my view that the obvious
                        non-conformity of the ODAC Notices is relevant to the question of
                        BCD’s state of mind at the time it made the CG
                Demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Second, and as Mr Isaacs pointed out, ABC
                    had put BCD on notice of the importance of a complying demand prior to BCD
                    making the CG39 Demand and subsequently, the CG38 Demand. It will be recalled
                    that before the CG39 Demand was made, BCD had made requests to extend or
                    liquidate CG39. On 20 June 2011, BCD made the second extend or liquidate
                    request on CG39 (see [11]–[12] above). In the second extend or liquidate
                    request, BCD stated that “we shall be grateful therefore if you [ABC]
                    would consider this SWIFT as an official claim for liquidation of the value
                    [secured by CG39]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     ABC responded to BCD on 22 June 2011,
                    informing BCD that its request “[did] not constitute a complying demand
                    as per the terms of [CG39]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> ABC further stated that in order for a
                    demand under CG39 to be valid, the demand had to “confirm that [BCD had]
                    received claim [<em>sic</em>] from [ODAC] in accordance
                    with the terms of the [APG] ...”. It was only after this reminder that
                    BCD made the CG39 Demand which stated falsely that BCD had received a demand
                    from ODAC in accordance with the terms of the APG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This is not a situation where BCD made a
                    demand which happened to contain false statements. As mentioned above, when BCD
                    made the second extend or liquidate request which purported to be a demand, ABC
                    drew the specific requirements of a valid demand under the CGs to BCD’s
                    attention on 22 June 2011. BCD was therefore reminded that CG39 required a
                    demand from BCD to state that it had received a conforming demand from ODAC
                    under the APG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Despite being put on notice of the requirement
                    to state that it had received a conforming demand from ODAC under the APG, BCD
                    nevertheless went on to falsely assert in the CG39 Demand on 23 June 2011,
                    and thereafter in the CG38 Demand on 11 July 2011, that it had received
                    conforming demands from ODAC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Sir Roy’s view was that these
                    circumstances did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there was fraud.
                    Sir Roy explained that there was another equally credible explanation. The
                    clerk at BCD who was unfamiliar with the requirements of demand guarantees could
                    have mechanically followed the requirements that ABC laid out in its SWIFT
                    message of 22 June 2011, without realising the effect of those requirements
                    or what exactly they entailed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Sir Roy stated that it was
                    therefore quite possible that the employee concerned did not even appreciate
                    that ODAC’s demands on the PB and the APG were
                non-conforming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I accept that a clerk at BCD could have done
                    as Sir Roy suggests. I also accept that that would not amount to fraud in
                    the sense of dishonesty. But it could amount to fraud in the sense of
                    recklessness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     This brings me to the third reason, that in
                    the context of demand guarantees, the <em>very concern of the
                        banks is with the documents presented to it</em>. If the same slip
                    occurred in the context of a consumer or retail transaction, then perhaps it
                    would not have amounted to recklessness. But this is a formal banking
                    transaction. It is no answer to suggest that BCD was unfamiliar with the
                    requirements of demand guarantees and what they entail, and therefore it did not
                    examine the documents presented to it before making the CG38 and CG39 Demands.
                    Although BCD was not required to be concerned with external facts, its core duty
                    was to examine the documents presented to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     If BCD had indeed made the CG38 and CG39
                    Demands mechanically without checking the requirements of the PB and APG which
                    formed the basis for its demands, then I am of the view that BCD acted
                    recklessly, in the sense that it was careless as to whether its statements were
                    true or false. Furthermore, this was not an accidental slip arising from some
                    inadvertent misdescription or spelling error, and the false statement was made
                    twice in respect of both CGs. Quite clearly, BCD did not care whether its
                    statement was true or false. This was all the more so when we remember that BCD
                    was informed by ABC that BCD’s own demand had to state that BCD had
                    received a demand from ODAC in accordance with the terms of the PB or APG (as
                    the case may be).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Fourth, the allegations of fraud which have
                    been made against BCD have been left unanswered. In <em>United
                        Trading</em>, the English Court of Appeal observed at 561 that a
                    failure to explain conduct may add to the finding of fraud:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The corroborated evidence of a plaintiff and the <em>unexplained failure of a beneficiary to respond to the
                            attack</em>, although given a fair and proper opportunity,
                            <em>may well make the only realistic inference that of
                            fraud</em>, although the possibility that he [the beneficiary] may
                        ultimately come forward with an explanation cannot be ruled out. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The facts and holding in <em>United Trading</em> provide a convenient starting point for the
                    discussion of this final reason. In <em>United
                    Trading</em>, the plaintiffs, which comprised European and South American
                    corporations from the same corporate group, supplied foodstuff to an Iraqi
                    entity known as Agromark. Agromark was controlled by the Iraqi Ministry of
                    Agriculture. The plaintiffs were required to secure performance of their
                    obligations to Agromark by procuring performance bonds in favour of Agromark
                    from Rafidain, which was an Iraqi state bank. The plaintiffs did not approach
                    Rafidain directly for the procurement of the performance bonds. They did so
                    through a chain of banks, much like the arrangement in the present
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     War broke out between Iran and Iraq, giving
                    rise to considerable disruption in the performance of the plaintiffs’
                    contracts with Agromark. Agromark subsequently called on the performance bonds.
                    The plaintiffs took the view that the calls were “manifestly
                    fraudulent”. The plaintiffs sought and obtained <em>ex
                        parte</em> injunctions against the banks, including Rafidain,
                    restraining payment. The injunctions were, however, discharged at <em>inter partes</em> hearings. The plaintiffs appealed to the
                    English Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The appeal was dismissed because the
                    plaintiffs had not produced sufficient evidence to show that “the only
                    realistic inference [was] that the demands were fraudulent”. In the
                    course of argument before the English Court of Appeal, counsel for the
                    plaintiffs placed “considerable reliance on Agromark’s failure to
                    disclose its defence to the charge of fraud” (<em>United
                        Trading</em> at 564). To this, the English Court of Appeal had a
                    pointed response: Agromark had legitimate reasons for not responding to the
                    allegations of fraud. The English Court of Appeal was therefore not prepared to
                    hold Agromark’s silence against it on the facts of that case (<em>United Trading</em> at 565):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The point is again made that each contract between the plaintiffs and
                        Agromark was made and was to be performed in Iraq, is subject to Iraqi law
                        and contains an Iraqi jurisdiction clause ... Iraqi Courts have exclusive
                        jurisdiction in the event of any dispute. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of this material, there is a wholly understandable reason for
                        Agromark not being prepared to answer in any detail the claim made against
                        them by the plaintiffs. Quite clearly Agromark do not wish to submit to the
                        jurisdiction of the English Courts and quite understandably take the view
                        that it is Iraqi law that has to be applied to the resolution of the
                        disputes and, pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause, that litigation
                        should take place in Iraq. <em>It seems to us that those
                            advising Agromark are justified in being wary of taking any steps that
                            might be said to result in Agromark submitting to the jurisdiction of
                            the English Courts or, even without submitting to the jurisdiction,
                            being indirectly drawn into litigation in this country concerning a
                            dispute which they understandably consider has no place here. In these
                            circumstances we do not consider that we are entitled to draw any strong
                            inference of guilt from Agromark’s silence.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     ABC in its closing submissions makes an
                    argument along similar lines. It says that BCD had a legitimate reason to
                    decline to participate in legal proceedings in Singapore because the Public
                    Works Contract, the PB and the APG were subject to the jurisdiction of the
                    Libyan courts and governed by Libyan law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the suggestion was
                    that BCD had a legitimate reason for not explaining its conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I do not accept ABC’s submission. BCD
                    may not have wanted to be a party to the Singapore proceedings, and
                    understandably so. But that did not preclude BCD from giving an explanation in a
                    manner that did not amount to a submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
                    court. BCD had an opportunity to do so on at least two occasions in 2012, but
                    did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     First, on 17 January 2012, ABC wrote to
                    BCD by letter. ABC informed BCD about the proceedings Boustead had commenced
                    against ABC in Singapore. Further, that Boustead had obtained an interim
                    injunction restraining ABC from making payment to BCD. The letter also stated
                    that one of Boustead’s allegations was that BCD had made an
                    “abusive call”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> ABC went on to state that the
                    proceedings are “in substance between Boustead on one hand, and BCD
                    and/or ODAC on the other”. ABC was a neutral party and would “[not
                    be] in a position to lead evidence on the substantive issues”. ABC
                    concluded by “strongly [urging] BCD to engage lawyers in Singapore to
                    make the necessary court application to be added as a
                defendant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     BCD’s response to ABC was by a letter
                    dated 19 January 2012. BCD addressed some concerns raised by ABC relating
                    to whether the Public Works Contract was still subsisting, and whether the UNSC
                    Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) prevented payment from being made to
                    BCD. BCD also added that the Public Works Contract was governed by
                    “Libyan law and no disputes concerning it can be heard except by the

                    party to the relationship between ABC and Boustead, and that BCD had “no
                    right to be involved in any litigation with [Boustead]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     BCD had a second opportunity to explain its
                    position in November 2012. On 22 November 2012, BCD wrote to ABC asking for
                    an update on the Singapore court proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> ABC provided a lengthy response on
                    28 November 2012. The response detailed the progress of the Singapore
                    litigation until that point. ABC also summarised Boustead’s statement of
                    claim in S 730/2012 stating clearly that one of the allegations was that
                    “ABC had turned a blind eye to the <em>fraud</em>
                    [perpetrated] <em>against Boustead by BCD and/or
                    ODAC</em>” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> ABC again reiterated that the dispute
                    was in substance between Boustead and BCD and/or ODAC and urged BCD to engage
                    Singapore counsel and apply to be added as a defendant in the Singapore
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     BCD responded on 3 December
                        2012,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> stating that the
                    dispute was a matter between Boustead and ABC, and that BCD did not consider
                    itself as having a right to be involved in the proceedings. BCD further stated
                    that ABC was “fully responsible” to BCD on CG38 and CG39, and that
                    BCD would help ABC in the Singapore litigation by “providing any
                    necessary documntation [<em>sic</em>] or
                    information” regarding CG38 and CG39.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     There is no evidence that BCD was specifically
                    informed that the allegation of fraud was in the context of BCD falsely stating
                    that it had received a demand for payment from ODAC in accordance with the terms
                    of the PB and APG respectively, when both ODAC Notices were obviously not in
                    accordance with the said terms. Nevertheless, BCD could and ought to have made
                    further inquiries as to the specific allegations of fraud that were made against
                    it if it was truly unaware of and concerned about the specificity of the
                    allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     BCD was, after all, presumably still seeking
                    payment on the CG Demands, which had been made more than a year ago. BCD was
                    aware of the fact that Boustead had obtained an order to restrain ABC from
                    making payment, and that ABC was involved in litigation in Singapore. BCD was
                    also aware that Boustead had made allegations of fraud against BCD in the
                    proceedings in Singapore. BCD could have explained its position through SWIFT
                    message or letter. That would not have resulted in BCD “submitting to the
                    jurisdiction [or] being indirectly drawn into litigation” in Singapore
                        (<em>United Trading</em> at 565). BCD did not do so.
                    Neither did BCD say that it chose not to state its position out of a fear of
                    being construed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court.
                    Furthermore, if the fear of submitting to the jurisdiction of another court is
                    accepted, without more, as a valid explanation for a non-response, then it would
                    generally be easy for a foreign party to justify a non-response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I add that the absence of a satisfactory
                    explanation is not necessary before a court may draw a conclusion of fraud in
                    the reckless sense. In <em>United Trading</em>, the
                    plaintiffs’ allegation of breach of contract by the beneficiary of the
                    bond was not clearly established. Hence the plaintiffs relied heavily on the
                    absence of a satisfactory response to the allegation to establish its allegation
                    of breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On the facts before me, the falsity of the
                    statements in the CG Demands is obvious. Boustead does not need to rely heavily
                    on the absence of a satisfactory response from BCD to establish that BCD acted
                    recklessly in view of the factors I mentioned above. It is therefore my view
                    that the only realistic inference to draw is that BCD made the CG38 and CG39
                    Demands recklessly, without caring as to the truth or falsity of the assertions
                    within them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether ABC had knowledge of BCD’s fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The next issue is whether ABC had knowledge of
                    BCD’s fraud at the relevant time. For analytical clarity, I will put the
                    issue another way, in the form of four questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, what are the facts which
                        establish that BCD made the CG Demands fraudulently?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, did ABC have knowledge of
                        those facts such that it knew (or ought to have known) that BCD made the CG
                        Demands fraudulently?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the second question is answered in the affirmative, then third:
                        when did ABC acquire knowledge of those facts?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, was ABC’s acquisition of those
                        facts within the relevant time?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The
                        second question focuses on the <em>state</em> or
                            <em>quality</em> of ABC’s knowledge. The
                        third and fourth questions focus on the <em>time</em>
                        ABC acquired such knowledge and whether it was within the relevant time for
                        the fraud exception. I should point out at this juncture that the English
                        law experts disagreed as to what the relevant time was for the purposes of
                        the fourth question. I will come back to this disagreement further
                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In relation to the first question, I have
                    stated my reasons for concluding that BCD made the CG Demands fraudulently in
                    the reckless sense at [68]–[91] above. There were four reasons that led me
                    to that conclusion, which I will summarise. First, the ODAC Notices were very
                    clearly not conforming demands in accordance with the terms of the PB and APG.
                    Second, ABC had put BCD on notice of the importance of a complying demand prior
                    to BCD making the CG39 Demand and the CG38 Demand. Third, in the context of
                    demand guarantees, BCD’s very concern would have been the documents
                    presented to it, namely the ODAC Notices. Fourth, BCD failed to provide a
                    satisfactory answer to the allegations of fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I turn to the second question of whether ABC
                    had knowledge of these facts and whether ABC therefore had knowledge that BCD
                    made the CG Demands fraudulently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Boustead commenced OS 503/2011 on
                    22 June 2011. Mr Koh Nghee Kwang, a project director of Boustead,
                    filed an affidavit dated 22 June 2011 in OS 503/2011 (“Mr
                    Koh’s first OS 503/2011 affidavit”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Mr Koh also was one
                    of Boustead’s witnesses in the proceedings before me. Mr Koh’s
                    first OS 503/2011 affidavit exhibited copies of the PB<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> and
                        APG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> ABC
                    was served with a copy of Mr Koh’s affidavit (and therefore the PB
                    and the APG) probably soon after 22 June 2011, because Ms Nehad
                    Alkazmawi filed a reply affidavit in OS 503/2011 dated 21 July
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> Ms Nehad was
                    an ex-employee of ABC, and the first vice-president of the Bank’s Global
                    Trade Finance &amp; Forfaiting Department at the material time. Ms Nehad
                    also gave evidence for ABC at the trial. Ms Nehad’s reply affidavit
                    made express reference (at paragraph 8)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> to Mr Koh’s first
                    OS 503/2011 affidavit and addressed the points raised
                therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     ABC received copies of the ODAC Notices on
                    14 July 2011 (see [14] above). ABC forwarded the ODAC Notices to Boustead
                    on 18 July 2011. By 14 July 2011, ABC would therefore have had (a)
                    copies of the PB and APG; (b) the ODAC Notices; and (c) the CG Demands made by
                    BCD on 28 June and 11 July 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The fact that ABC possessed these three
                    documents alone did not necessarily mean that ABC knew that BCD had been
                    fraudulent in the sense of being reckless. However, the first three of the four
                    facts I mentioned above (at [93]) would have been obvious to ABC, leaving aside
                    for the time being the point that BCD had not given any satisfactory explanation
                    why it had made the false statements. The non-conformity of the ODAC Notices was
                    manifest. ABC was aware of the necessity of conforming demands in the context of
                    demand guarantees. I reiterate that ABC sent BCD a reminder on 22 June 2011
                    that BCD’s extend or liquidate requests were not valid demands, and of the
                    requirements for a conforming demand. ABC itself was a bank that dealt in demand
                    guarantees. ABC would have been alive to the concern of the primacy of documents
                    in such transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In view of these circumstances, I find that by
                    14 July 2011, ABC must have known, or ought to have known, based on the
                    documents in its possession, that BCD made the CG Demands recklessly, without
                    caring as to their truth or falsity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     If that finding is incorrect, and ABC did not
                    have knowledge of BCD’s fraud on 14 July 2011, then it is my view
                    that ABC must have known of BCD’s fraud, at the latest, on
                    24 September 2012. That was when Boustead filed its statement of claim in
                    S 730/2012. In the statement of claim, Boustead alleged at
                    paragraphs 37(b) and (c) that the ODAC Notices did not comply with the
                    requirements of a valid demand under the PB or APG, and the statements that BCD
                    made in its CG Demands were therefore untrue or incorrect. These allegations,
                    coupled with the fact that ABC already had in its possession copies of the ODAC
                    Notices, the PB and APG, as well as BCD’s CG Demands, must have resulted
                    in ABC knowing that BCD made the CG Demands recklessly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    That brings me to the fourth question, of
                    whether ABC acquired knowledge of BCD’s fraud within the relevant time.
                    Both Boustead and ABC disagreed over when the relevant time was for the purpose
                    of the fraud exception under English law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Boustead’s position is that under
                    English law, the fraud exception is triggered as long as ABC has knowledge of
                    BCD’s fraud at any time prior to its having made payment. ABC has not made
                    payment to BCD. It has been restrained from doing so by a court order since
                    23 June 2011 (save for the narrow window between 29 and 30 August
                    2011 when the first injunction was discharged and a second injunction was
                    granted). Boustead’s submission is that ABC must have been put on notice
                    of BCD’s fraud—at the latest—by the time of the trial in early
                    to mid-2014. ABC would accordingly be discharged from its obligation to pay BCD
                    under the CG38 and CG39 Demands from the time it acquired such
                knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    ABC’s position is that the relevant
                    time is when the bank has taken an irrevocable step in reliance on the apparent
                    conformity of the demands presented, and in ignorance of any fraud. ABC claims
                    that that occurred when ABC made the FA Demand against Boustead on
                    3 September 2012 and, following Boustead’s failure to pay, issued the
                    EOD Notice to terminate the FA on 10 September 2012. Accordingly, if ABC
                    subsequently acquired knowledge of BCD’s fraud, the fraud exception would
                    not be satisfied, as ABC’s knowledge only arose after the relevant
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Both parties’ positions on the
                    relevant time are predicated on an implicit factual premise: that ABC only
                    acquired knowledge of BCD’s fraud <em>after</em> it
                    issued the EOD Notice on 10 September 2012. If my finding above at [98]
                    above is correct, and ABC knew or ought to have known of BCD’s fraud on
                    14 July 2011, then that factual premise is removed. The issue of the
                    relevant time falls away because ABC’s knowledge of BCD’s fraud
                    would have been acquired before what ABC itself was contending as the cut-off
                    date for the relevant time (10 September 2012).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    If that finding is incorrect, and ABC only
                    knew of BCD’s fraud on 24 September 2012 (when Boustead filed its
                    statement of claim in S 730/2012), then the issue of the relevant time is
                    engaged. If ABC is right in its submission that the relevant time stopped
                    running on 10 September 2012, then ABC’s subsequent acquisition of
                    knowledge of BCD’s fraud on 24 September 2012 would not have
                    triggered the fraud exception. ABC’s liability to BCD under the CG would
                    have crystallised as at the relevant time. I will therefore turn to address the
                    issue of the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    There was considerable evidence from
                    Mr Isaacs and Sir Roy on the issue of the relevant time. Each party
                    also made substantial closing submissions asserting the correctness of their
                    positions of the relevant time under English law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Isaacs relied on two cases in
                    support of his (and Boustead’s) position:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Sir Roy (supporting ABC’s
                    position), on the other hand, relied on two other cases:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Both Mr Isaacs and Sir Roy agreed
                    that no clear approach to the relevant time of fraud had been established by
                    existing case law. They agreed that a bank would not be affected by fraud which
                    comes to its knowledge only <em>after</em> it has made
                    payment (which was the holding in <em>United Trading</em>).
                    Their opinions diverged as to when the relevant time would be in a situation
                    where the bank had not yet made payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    From the cases, Sir Roy extrapolated a
                    principle which he said governed the relevant time for the bank’s
                    knowledge. He stated that once the bank has acted irrevocably in reliance on the
                    apparent conformity of the presentation and in ignorance of any fraud, it would
                    be quite unfair to deprive the bank of its right to be indemnified by its
                    customer. In Sir Roy’s view, ABC took the irrevocable step when,
                    after having made the FA Demand on Boustead which was not complied with, ABC
                    terminated the FA by issuing the EOD Notice on 10 September
                2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Mr Isaacs, on the other hand, gave
                    evidence that the better view was that the relevant time was any time prior to
                    the bank having made payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Since ABC has not made payment, it
                    would have definitely have knowledge of fraud within the relevant
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It seems to me that the disagreement between
                    Mr Isaacs and Sir Roy is not as great as it appears. The evidence of
                    Mr Isaacs and of Sir Roy may be reconciled in the following
                    proposition: that if the bank has taken an irrevocable step in reliance on the
                    apparent conformity of the demands, and in the absence of knowledge of fraud,
                    this would stop the relevant time running. They disagreed as to what amounts to
                    an irrevocable step. To Mr Isaacs, only payment by ABC on the CG Demands
                    would suffice. To Sir Roy, the subsequent issuance of the EOD Notice after
                    the FA Demand was made constituted an irrevocable step even though ABC had not
                    made payment yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Even if I accept Sir Roy’s
                    proposition that some other act apart from payment may amount to an irrevocable
                    step, my view is that ABC’s issuance of the EOD Notice (and thus purported
                    termination of the FA) is no more an irrevocable step than its FA Demand on
                    Boustead. In cross-examination, it was suggested to Sir Roy that
                    ABC’s termination of the FA was not an irrevocable step. Sir Roy
                        explained:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assuming that the [CG Demands] were apparently conforming demands, [ABC]
                        incurred a liability to pay within a given number of days of the demand and
                        the only reason it hasn’t been paid is the injunction. If the
                        injunction were to be lifted, and nobody can ever be sure when an injunction
                        would be lifted, it would have to make immediate payment. So, to protect
                        itself, [ABC] invoked be provisions of [the FA] and those not having been
                        complied with ... [ABC] terminated [the FA] ... So it’s not really
                        involuntary in that sense at all. They acted, I think, out of what was
                        perceived to be commercial need.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>But ABC’s termination of the FA simply means that it is
                        no longer obliged to make the facilities under the FA available to Boustead.
                        It does not mean that ABC cannot exercise other accrued rights, if
                        any.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Therefore, the fraud exception would still
                    be satisfied even if I am incorrect in my finding that ABC knew or ought to have
                    known of BCD’s fraud on 14 July 2011 at [98] above. ABC would, in any
                    event have known of BCD’s fraud on 24 September 2012 (see [99] above)
                    which was within the relevant time based on the English law evidence which I
                    have heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the CG Demands conformed to the terms of the CGs and if not
                whether ABC had knowledge of the non-conformity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I turn now to Boustead’s alternative
                    argument, that BCD’s demands for payment under the CGs are invalid because
                    they did not conform with the terms of the CGs. In view of my conclusion above,
                    this question is no longer a live one. I will nonetheless address the extensive
                    arguments and evidence on the alternative argument in case I am
                wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Under English law, a demand for payment
                    under the CGs must comply strictly with the requirements in the CGs for the
                    demand to be valid. Further, since the CGs incorporate the URDG 458, the demands
                    also have to comply with the requirements stipulated in the URDG
                458.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Before going into the alleged grounds of
                    non-conformity, it will be helpful to set out in full the terms of the CGs,
                    which were issued by ABC in favour of BCD, as well as the CG38 and CG39
                    Demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    CG38 and CG39 are substantially similar to
                    each other and stipulate the same requirements for a conforming demand. The only
                    differences are: (a) the CG reference numbers; (b) the sums secured under the
                    CGs; and (c) the name of the guarantee (the PB or the APG) to which the CGs
                    relate. I have underlined the differences for convenience. CG38

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    It will be recalled that the demand on CG39
                    (that relates to the APG) was made <em>before</em> the
                    demand on CG38 (that relates to the PB). It appears that BCD simply reproduced
                    the earlier CG39 Demand for the subsequent CG38 Demand, making only amendments
                    to the sum demanded and the reference numbers. BCD apparently omitted to make
                    changes to the description of the guarantee to which CG38 related to (hence the
                    reference to “advance payment guarantee” instead of
                    “performance bond” in the CG38 demand).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The non-conformity that Boustead complains
                    of falls into three categories:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the CG38 Demand refers to
                        the <em>advance payment guarantee</em> and <em>advance guarantee</em>, when the underlying guarantee
                        to which CG38 relates is the “performance bond”. The CG39
                        Demand refers to an <em>advance guarantee</em> when
                        the underlying guarantee to which CG39 relates is the “advance
                        payment guarantee”. I will refer to this as the “incorrect
                        description” issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the CG38 and CG39 Demands refer to instruments
                        with reference numbers of <em>No 10/21/LG00008/2007</em> and <em>No 10/21/LG00009/07</em> respectively. The reference numbers
                        are incorrect, because the reference numbers of the PB and APG are
                        10/21/LG008/2007 and 10/21/LG009/2007 respectively. The non-conformity is
                        alleged to arise from the insertion of two additional zeros in the reference
                        numbers of the PB and APG. I will refer to this as the “incorrect
                        reference number” issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, both the CG38 and CG39 Demands do not state that
                        BCD has received demands [<em>ie</em>, the ODAC
                        Notices] in accordance with Art 20(b) of the URDG 458, as is required
                        by Art 20(b). I will refer to this as the
                        “Art 20(b)” issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Before I address these issues, I set out the
                    evidence given by the English law experts on the conformity of a demand under
                    English law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">English law on the conformity of a demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The English law experts in their joint
                    report agreed that whether a demand is conforming is purely a question of
                    construction of the demands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Both agreed that two principles of construction
                    were applicable: (a) that the demands must be read as a whole and (b) in a
                    manner which avoids absurdity or inconsistency. Mr Isaacs, however,
                    disagreed with Sir Roy’s position that a third principle was
                    applicable: (c) that the demand must be construed, where possible, in such a way
                    as to uphold its validity rather than render it ineffective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Mr Isaacs’ supplementary expert
                    report, which was prepared subsequent to the joint expert report, stated that
                    the question was “more correctly to be one of construction of [the CG]
                    and not of [the demand]: what did [the CG] require in order for there to be a
                    conforming demand thereunder?”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Mr Isaacs considered this to be
                    consistent with the approach adopted by Teare J in <em>Sea-Cargo Skips AS v State Bank of India</em> [2013] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 477 (“<em>Sea-Cargo Skips</em>”). In
                        <em>Sea-Cargo Skips</em>, the question that
                    Teare J posed at [30] in determining whether a demand made under a
                    performance bond was conforming was: “what type of demand did the parties
                    intend would trigger the bank’s liability to pay?” Mr Isaacs
                    maintained this position in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It also appears from Sir Roy’s
                    oral evidence that his approach was the same as that of Mr Isaacs’.
                    Sir Roy stated in cross-examination that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My point here is there is <em>nothing in the terms of the
                            counter-guarantee</em> that specifies that there must be a
                        reference to advance payment guarantee or any other means of identification.
                        All that was necessary was that you should gather from the document as a
                        whole that this demand was referring to the relevant guarantee. That is a
                        matter of construction. That was agreed -- that was agreed by the two of us
                        in our joint report to be a matter of construction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    It is apparent then, that the common ground
                    between the experts was that the issue of conformity turned on two distinct
                    questions of construction. The prior question being one of <em>construing the CG</em> to determine what was required for a demand to
                    be conforming. The subsequent question was that of <em>construing
                        the demand</em> to determine whether it complied with what was
                    required by the CG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I am mindful of the difficulties with
                    considering expert evidence on the correct construction of a document governed
                    by foreign law. First, the construction of documents is an inherently technical
                    exercise. At times the distinctions that the English experts were attempting to
                    draw were so fine that they bordered on being, as counsel for ABC put it,
                    “distinction[s] without a difference”. The second difficulty is
                    drawing the line between “where proof of foreign law ends and application
                    of the foreign law begins”: Yeo Tiong Min, <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6(2) at
                    para 75.297. Principles of construction have to be proven as foreign law,
                    but the <em>application</em> of those principles to the
                    facts is a question of forum procedure in the adjudication process: <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc</em> [2008] 2
                    SLR(R) 491 at [81].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The incorrect description issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Boustead submits that <em>both</em> the CG38 and CG39 Demands were non-conforming because they
                    made reference to an incorrect underlying guarantee. I note that the severity of
                    the alleged non-conformity in the CG38 Demand is greater than that in the CG39
                    Demand. The CG38 Demand describes the underlying guarantee incorrectly (it
                    refers to “advance payment guarantee” and “advance
                    guarantee” instead of “performance bond”). The CG39 Demand
                    merely omits the word “payment” towards the end of the CG39
                    Demand; further, “advance payment guarantee” is used earlier on in
                    the demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The CG38 Demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Adopting the approach described above, the
                    first step is to construe CG38 to determine what is required from a demand made
                    under it. It will be helpful to reproduce for convenience the operative portion
                    of CG38:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In consideration of your issuing the above performance bond, we hereby
                        unconditionally and irrevocably undertake to reimburse you on your first
                        written demand communicated through authenticated SWIFT message or
                        registered mail, despite any contestation on the part of the applicant or a
                        third-party provided you confirm that you have received claim [<em>sic</em>] from [ODAC] in accordance with the terms of the
                        above performance bond provided such amount does not exceed the guaranteed
                        sum of USD 3,760,387.95 (as defined in the above performance bond). Such
                        demand shall be supported by a written statement specifying that you have
                        received a demand for payment under the above performance bond in accordance
                        with its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    What does CG38 require of a conforming
                    demand? Does CG38 require a written statement that a demand for payment has been
                    received in accordance with the terms of an instrument <em>expressly described</em> to be the “performance bond”?
                    Or does CG38 merely require a written statement <em>conveying the
                        information</em> that a demand for payment has been received in
                    accordance with the terms of the PB?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I am of the view that all CG38 requires is
                    that the demand convey the information that a demand for payment has been
                    received in accordance with the terms of the PB. I am of the view that the
                    parties would have intended a demand which stated the receipt of “a
                    demand for payment under the <em>above guarantee</em> in
                    accordance with its terms” and which mentioned the reference numbers of
                    CG38 and the PB, would have been conforming. Put the other way, the failure to
                    mention “performance bond” is not fatal. It would have been
                    sufficient for the recipient to have known that the demand was made under
                    CG38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The second question of construction is
                    whether the CG38 Demand complied with the requirements of CG38. In line with the
                    analysis above, the demand must conform strictly with the requirement that it
                        <em>convey the information</em> that a demand had been
                    received in accordance with the terms of the PB. It will be helpful to set out
                    again the relevant portions of the CG38 demand:</p>

                        until 31/12/2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Applying the principles of construing the
                    demand as a whole, and reading the demand in such a manner as to avoid absurdity
                    and inconsistency (the two principles of construction agreed on by the English
                    law experts), I am of the view that the demand conveys the information that a
                    demand has been received in accordance with the terms of the PB. The CG38 Demand
                    is therefore not invalidated by the incorrect reference to the “advance
                    guarantee” or “advance payment guarantee”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Mr Isaacs made the point that an
                    incorrect description in the CG38 Demand created ambiguity as to whether or not
                    the demand was made under CG38 to begin with.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> However, stacked against that are three other
                    factors that would lead a reader of the CG38 Demand to the conclusion that it
                    was in fact made under CG38, and that the incorrect description of the
                    instrument was merely a slip. First, under “Transaction Reference
                    Number” heading, the reference number of the PB is indicated. Second,
                    under the “Related Reference” and “Narrative”
                    headings, the reference number of CG38 is indicated. Third, the sum demanded was
                    the precise amount covered by CG38 down to the last cent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Mr Isaacs further expressed the view
                    that “the correct question” was whether “it’s
                    apparent on its face that the demand is compliant”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> While Mr Isaacs stressed that the
                    mention of an incorrect instrument immediately rendered the demand
                    non-compliant, he perhaps glossed over the first question of construction as to
                    what “compliance” meant under the terms of the CG38. His assertion
                    that the CG38 Demand’s reference to the incorrect instrument rendered it
                    non-compliant also does not cohere with his subsequently expressed opinion that
                    neither CG38 nor the URDG required the nature of the guarantee to be stated in a
                    demand under CG38.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Ms Nehad, an ex-employee of ABC gave
                    evidence on this point. In cross-examination, Ms Nehad was asked whether
                    she agreed that the reference to “advance payment guarantee” was
                    wrong, and that it must have been immediately obvious to anyone looking at
                        it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> She agreed. While Ms Nehad
                    subsequently also agreed that there was no strict compliance,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> that in my view, was a legal
                    conclusion, which could not be answered by a witness of fact. It would have been
                    apparent to any reader that the use of the label “advance payment
                    guarantee” or “advance guarantee” was a mistake. The CG38
                    demand therefore complied with what was required of a demand under
                CG38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    There remain two other points raised by the
                    English law experts which I should address. First, they disagreed as to whether
                    the principle of construction in favour of upholding the validity of an
                    instrument applied to the construction of demands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> I too share the unease expressed by
                    Mr Isaacs about the principle’s compatibility with that of strict
                    compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Second, Sir Roy also expressed the
                    opinion that, at the time of the CG38 Demand, a demand under CG39 for
                    US$15,021,093.25 had already been made. He stated that the CG38 Demand could
                    therefore only have referred to the PB. He considered this the
                    “context” which could properly be relied on while construing the
                    CG38 Demand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> That would, in his view, have
                    removed any ambiguity that would have arisen from the incorrect description of
                    the instrument. His approach, however, does not sit comfortably with the
                    principle of autonomy, and that the bank is only concerned with documents and
                    not facts, which Sir Roy had earlier placed such great emphasis
                on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I therefore did not take into account these
                    two points in coming to my conclusion that the CG38 Demand was made in
                    accordance with the terms of CG38.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The CG39 Demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    As mentioned above, the severity of the
                    incorrect description in the case of the CG39 Demand is not as great as that in
                    the case of the CG38 Demand. I set out the CG39 Demand again for
                        convenience:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Boustead’s objection to the incorrect
                    description in the CG39 Demand is the reference to the “advance
                    guarantee” (in double-underline) instead of “advance payment
                    guarantee”. It should be noted, however, that “advance payment
                    guarantee” in full is mentioned on two instances (in underline) prior to
                    the mention of the “advance guarantee”. It would therefore be
                    apparent that the omission of the word “payment” was a slip. The
                    omission does not create any ambiguity that renders the CG39 Demand
                    non-conforming to the terms of CG39. In any event, the incorrect description
                    issue in relation to CG39 was not pleaded by Boustead nor raised in the course
                    of the trial. The point was raised for the first time in its closing
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The incorrect reference number issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Boustead relies on the additional zeros
                    referred to in the CG38 and CG39 Demands and argues that this rendered the
                    demands non-conforming (see above at [120(b)]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>
                    Boustead relies on the Singapore Court of Appeal case of <em>Indian Overseas Bank v United Coconut Mills Inc</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R)
                    12 (“<em>Indian Overseas Bank v United Coconut
                        Mills</em>”) in support of its argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I do not accept that the CG38 and CG39
                    Demands were non-conforming for including additional zeros. That, in my view,
                    was an immaterial error and would not have affected the conformity of the
                    demands. It also bears mention that Boustead’s English law expert,
                        Mr Isaacs,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> agreed with ABC’s position and
                    Sir Roy that the additional zeros were immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Boustead’s reliance on the Singapore
                    case of <em>Indian Overseas Bank v United Coconut
                        Mills</em> is misplaced. First, the conformity of the CG38 Demand is
                    an issue to be decided under English law. There was extensive English law
                    evidence led on the point. The utility of a Singapore case is therefore
                    questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Second, <em>Indian Overseas
                        Bank v United Coconut Mills</em> raised quite different facts from the
                    facts presently before me. There, one of the supporting documents made a
                    reference to measurements of “oleic acid” instead of
                    “lauric acid” as was required under the letter of credit. The
                    Court of Appeal was of the view that although it was a widely known fact in the
                    industry that oleic and lauric acid could be used interchangeably, it would not
                    have been apparent to an ordinary and reasonably competent banker that this was
                    the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Art 20(b) issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The final ground of non-conformity that
                    Boustead relies on is the failure of the CG38 and CG39 Demands to mention that
                    ODAC’s Notices were made in accordance with the terms of Art 20(b) of
                    the URDG 458.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Article 20 of the URDG 458 stipulates
                    the documentary requirements for a conforming demand. It has separate
                    requirements for demands made under a demand guarantee on one hand, and a
                    counter-guarantee on the other. Article 20(a) lists the requirements for a
                    conforming demand under a guarantee (the PB and the APG). It requires that a
                    demand for payment under a guarantee must be supported by a written statement
                    stating that: (i) the principal (the JV) is in breach of its obligation(s) in
                    the underlying contract (the Public Works Contract); and (ii) the respect in
                    which the principal is in breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Art 20(b) applies to
                    counter-guarantees. Art 20(b) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any demand under the Counter-Guarantee shall be supported by a written
                        statement that the Guarantor has received a demand for payment under the
                        Guarantee in accordance with its terms <em>and with this
                            Article</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The English law experts agreed that the requirement in Art
                        20(b) was only invoked where the underlying guarantee (in this case, the PB
                        and APG) was <em>also</em> governed by the URDG
                            458.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The PB and APG are governed
                        by Libyan law, and the URDG 458 was not incorporated on the face of the
                        documents. Boustead’s Libyan law expert, Dr Tumi, gave evidence
                        that the URDG 458 was incorporated into the PB and APG as a matter of Libyan
                        law. Boustead’s position is that since the PB and APG incorporated the
                        URDG 458, then in order for the CG38 and CG39 Demands to be conforming, they
                        had to state additionally that the demands under the PB and APG were
                        received in conformity with the requirements of
                Art 20.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Boustead’s pleadings on Art 20(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The first objection ABC takes to the
                    Art 20(b) issue is that Boustead did not plead it. There are three parts to
                    Boustead’s Art 20(b) argument: (a) that the PB and APG are governed
                    by Libyan law; (b) that Libyan law incorporates the URDG 458 into the PB and
                    APG; and (c) that BCD’s demands were invalid because they failed to comply
                    with Art 20(b).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    On the first part, Boustead’s position
                    at trial is consistent with ABC’s pleaded position that Libyan law applied
                    to the PB and the APG in its amended defence and counterclaim,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> although ABC’s pleading was
                    denied by Boustead in its amended defence and reply to counterclaim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In relation to the second part, Boustead
                    could not point to anything in its pleadings that expressly states that Libyan
                    law incorporated the URDG 458. The best it could muster was a reference at
                    paragraph 5(c) of its amended reply and defence to counterclaim that it would
                    “rely on the provisions of the [URDG 458] for their full purport and
                        effect”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> This
                    paragraph in Boustead’s amended reply and defence to counterclaim,
                    however, was in response to paragraph 13 of ABC’s amended defence and
                    counterclaim, which concerned the applicability of the URDG 458 <em>to the CGs</em> and had nothing to do with the PB and
                    APG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    As to the third part, Boustead relies on its
                    answer dated 9 September 2013 in response to ABC’s request for
                    further and better particulars. The answer states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Boustead] avers that ODAC’s purported ‘<em>extend or pay</em>’ notices are not demands which comply
                        with the terms of the respective guarantees and in breach of the
                        requirements of Article 20 of the [URDG 458].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As can be seen, the reference to Art 20 of the URDG 458
                        was targeted at the non-compliance of the ODAC Notices, rather than the CG38
                        and CG39 Demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In my view, none of the pleadings referred
                    to above adequately cover the points they are said to establish, much less a
                    coherent pleading covering all three points which makes clear that Boustead is
                    relying on Art 20(b) of the URDG 458 to invalidate the CG38 and CG39
                    Demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The issue of Boustead’s deficient
                    pleadings was brought up at various junctures across two tranches of the trial.
                    Despite the considerable controversy over the adequacy of Boustead’s
                    pleadings, it was not addressed in Boustead’s closing submissions. ABC, on
                    the other hand, took strong objection to the state of Boustead’s pleadings
                    in its closing submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> In Boustead’s reply closing
                    submissions, Boustead raised four points in response to ABC’s
                    objection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    First, Boustead argues that ABC’s
                    allegations of deficiencies in its pleadings are baseless, “as Boustead
                    had already pleaded Article 20(b) in its pleadings”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> This is a bare assertion which is
                    neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Second, Boustead argues that “the
                    purport of Art 20(b) is a matter of law and is in fact obvious on its face,
                    and need not be pleaded”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> It seems to me that it is not sufficient
                    for Boustead to say that the purport of Art 20(b) is obvious on its face.
                    Boustead has to plead that it was relying on Art 20(b) <em>to invalidate the CG38 and CG39 Demands</em>. It did not do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Third, Boustead states that “[i]n
                    relation to the alleged deficiency of Boustead’s pleadings on Libyan law,
                    it is also trite that matters of law need not be pleaded”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> However, it is well established that
                    foreign law is required to be pleaded and proved as a fact: <em>EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [56]. Otherwise, the court treats the
                    case as a purely domestic one and applies Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Fourth, Boustead states that “[i]n
                    any event, ABC was not prejudiced in any way, and was given ample opportunity to
                    address this point, by way of the Joint English Law Experts Report, Professor
                    Goode’s two supplementary opinions …”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> No authority was cited for the
                    proposition that the lack of prejudice overcomes a deficiency in pleadings.
                    Clearly, Boustead’s pleadings on the issue are inadequate and Boustead
                    failed to amend its pleadings in the face of repeated objection by ABC to
                    Boustead’s reliance on the Art 20(b) argument in the light of its
                    pleadings. I am of the view that the inadequacy of Boustead’s pleadings is
                    sufficient to dismiss this argument. I will nonetheless address the merits of
                    the argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    I return to the three parts necessary to
                    establish Boustead’s Art 20(b) argument: (a) the PB and the APG were
                    governed by Libyan law; (b) Libyan law incorporates the URDG 458 into the PB and
                    APG; and (c) BCD’s demands were invalid because they failed to comply with
                    Art 20(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    There is no dispute as to the first point,
                    which is consistent with ABC’s position that Libyan law is the proper law
                    of both the PB and the APG. The more contentious issue is whether Libyan law
                    incorporates the URDG 458 into the PB and APG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether Libyan law incorporates the URDG 458 into the PB and
                APG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Dr Tumi, Boustead’s Libyan law
                    expert, gave evidence that Art 764 of the Libyan Commercial Code
                    (“the Commercial Code”) incorporated the URDG 458 into the PB and
                    the APG. Article 746 of the Commercial Code states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Letters of Guarantee shall be subject to international unified banking
                        regulations and customs on all matters which are not regulated under this
                        Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Dr Tumi’s oral evidence was that the URDG 458 fell
                        within “international unified banking regulations and customs”
                        and was therefore incorporated into the PB and the APG at part of Libyan
                            law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    However, no mention of the URDG 458 was made
                    in Dr Tumi’s expert report dated 19 December 2013. Dr Tumi
                    only gave evidence that Libyan law incorporated the URDG 458 into the PB and APG
                    when he was on the stand. He gave evidence on the point only because counsel for
                    Boustead made an eleventh-hour oral application (which I allowed) for
                    Dr Tumi to do so on the day he took the stand. The application was to
                    amplify Dr Tumi’s testimony to cover the issue of whether Libyan law
                    incorporated the URDG 458 into the PB and APG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Further, the substance of
                    Dr Tumi’s evidence on this point was unimpressive. First,
                    Dr Tumi had no material to support his assertion that the URDG 458 fell
                    within “international unified banking regulations and
                        customs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> Dr Tumi did
                    not produce any court decisions, academic articles or other literature
                    supporting his proposition that this was so. All Dr Tumi relied on was his
                    bare assertion that this was the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Second, when it was suggested to
                    Dr Tumi that “international unified banking regulations and
                    customs” could refer to a few instruments apart from the URDG 458,
                    Dr Tumi responded tersely: “in practice we normally apply such
                        rules”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> No other substantiation or
                    explanation was provided for his assertion. Further, when Dr Tumi’s
                    attention was drawn to other international instruments such as the International
                    Standby Practices 1998, he stated that he could not assist the
                        court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    While a court is not entitled to substitute
                    its own views for those of an expert who is not contradicted, the court must
                    also not accept unchallenged evidence without question. An expert’s
                    evidence must be sifted, weighed and evaluated: <em>Sakthivel
                        Punithavathi v PP</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [76]. In my view, the
                    evidence given by Dr Tumi on Libyan law incorporating the URDG 458 was
                    unconvincing, and I do not accept it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    I am therefore of the view that Boustead has
                    not discharged its burden of proving that the URDG 458 was incorporated into the
                    PB and APG by virtue of Art 746 of the Commercial Code. It is not necessary
                    for me to examine whether the CG38 and CG39 Demands were invalid because they
                    failed to conform to the requirements of Art 20(b) of the URDG
                458.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether ABC had knowledge of the non-conformity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Since Boustead’s position is that ABC
                    made the FA Demand fraudulently, ABC’s knowledge of the non-conformities,
                    if any, might also be relevant. I have found that the CG Demands conformed to
                    the requirements of the CGs under English law. It is therefore not necessary for
                    me to address this question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on whether ABC’s claim against Boustead is
                fraudulent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Based on the analysis above, I have
                    concluded that, on an application of English law, ABC would not be liable to pay
                    BCD under the CGs because BCD made the CG Demands fraudulently (in the reckless
                    sense), and ABC would have had knowledge of BCD’s fraud at the relevant
                    time. I now come to the question of Boustead’s liability to
                ABC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Boustead’s argument is that, in view
                    of the invalidity of the CG Demands made by BCD, <em>ABC’s
                        claim against Boustead</em> is made fraudulently. Boustead says that
                    the known facts and information leading up to the trial reveal that the demands
                    made by BCD were either made fraudulently, or alternatively, were
                    non-conforming. Boustead repeatedly brought the fraud or non-conformity of
                    BCD’s demands to ABC’s attention, to which ABC turned a blind
                        eye.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> Boustead says that this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the light of these findings,

                        knowledge of the invalidity of the CG Demands as a consequence of
                        BCD’s fraud <em>after</em> 3 September 2012,
                        it is fraudulent (in the reckless sense) for ABC to continue maintaining its

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In essence, Boustead asserts that ABC,
                    despite being aware of the circumstances above, was “indifferent”
                    to the invalidity of BCD’s claims. ABC’s sustained indifference
                    leads one to reach an “irresistible conclusion”, namely that ABC
                    was complicit in BCD’s false claim for the counter-guaranteed
                        sums.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In my view, these circumstances do not
                    suggest a conspiracy between ABC and BCD. The allegation of a conspiracy is
                    speculative. If ABC was conspiring with BCD or ODAC to perpetrate a fraud
                    against Boustead, BCD would not have forwarded copies of the ODAC Notices to ABC
                    and, likewise, ABC would not have forwarded such copies to Boustead (see [14]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether it would be unconscionable for ABC to obtain payment from
                Boustead against the FA Demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    It is well established that under Singapore
                    law, injunctive relief will be granted to restrain payment under a demand
                    guarantee where the beneficiary makes a demand for payment unconscionably.
                    Unconscionability exists as a distinct ground from fraud for restraining payment
                    on a demand. It covers situations of abuse, unfairness and dishonesty: <em>BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 3 SLR
                    352 (“<em>BS Mount Sophia</em>”) at
                    [18]–[19]. Singapore courts have departed from English law, which
                    recognises only fraud as an exception to the restraint of a demand for payment
                    under a demand guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Boustead argues in its reply closing
                    submissions that the demands for payment by ODAC or BCD under the CGs or the PB
                    and APG are unconscionable. Boustead argues that “[ABC’s] attempt
                    to enforce its rights under the FA would be unconscionable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> The application of
                    unconscionability in this case raises a number of legal issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    First, there is the choice of law problem:
                    what is the law applicable to the grant of injunctive relief for restraining
                    payment against a demand under a demand guarantee?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    It is clear that Singapore law is applicable
                    where both the underlying contract (or the equivalent of the Public Works
                    Contract in the present case) and the demand guarantee are governed by Singapore
                    law: see for example, <em>Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp;
                        Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin
                        Zayed Al Nahyan</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>Dauphin Offshore</em>”), <em>BS Mount
                        Sophia</em> and <em>JBE Properties Pte Ltd v Gammon Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 47 <em>(“JBE
                        Properties</em>”). It is also clear that Singapore law does not
                    apply where both the underlying contract and the demand guarantee are governed
                    by English law: <em>Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd v PT Merak
                        Energi Indonesia and another</em> [2010] 2 SLR 329 (“<em>Shanghai Electric v PT Merak</em>”) at [30] and
                    [35].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The authorities have not addressed what law
                    will apply to the grant of an injunction where different laws govern the
                    underlying contract and the demand guarantee in question. In <em>Shanghai Electric v PT Merak</em>, Lee Seiu Kin J characterised
                    the restraint of a demand made under a demand guarantee as a substantive matter.
                    It was therefore not governed by the <em>lex fori</em>, but
                    the applicable law reached after applying the relevant choice of law rule:
                        <em>Shanghai Electric v PT Merak</em> at [17] and
                    [30].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Lee J did not, however, articulate the
                    choice of law rule that he applied to determine that English law was the
                    applicable law. Indeed, he had no need to. Both the underlying contract and the
                    demand guarantee in that case were governed by English law. English law was
                    therefore the only potentially applicable law once the <em>lex
                        fori</em> (Singapore law) was excluded. Lee J nevertheless seems
                    to have thought that the applicable law was the law governing the demand
                    guarantee (see his characterisation of the issue in <em>Shanghai
                        Electric v PT Merak</em> at [2]), and I would hold that it is as
                    such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    I recognise that the issue of whether an
                    injunction should be granted to restrain a demand necessarily entails
                    “examin[ing] the circumstances surrounding the underlying
                    contract”: <em>Dauphin Offshore</em> at [37]. But
                    applying the law governing the demand guarantee is the most intuitive and most
                    likely to be consistent with the parties’ expectations. Parties would
                    likely expect that the conditions under which they are entitled to make a demand
                    for payment, and the circumstances where they would be precluded from receiving
                    payment, would be determined by the law governing the demand guarantee under
                    which the demand for payment is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Accordingly, Libyan law would apply to the
                    restraint of payment on demands under the PB and APG. However, this question
                    does not arise because neither BCD nor ODAC are party to the present
                    proceedings. English law would apply to the restraint of payment on demands
                    under the CGs. Since English law does not recognise unconscionability as a
                    ground of restraint of payment/demands, this is also a moot point. Singapore law
                    would apply to the restraint of payment on demands under the FA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the unconscionability exception applies to the FA
                Demand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    There is a second difficulty that arises in
                    the context of demands made under the FA. It is not clear whether the
                    unconscionability exception applies to a demand made by a bank against its
                    customer under a facility agreement. Thus far, the situations where the court
                    has dealt with the unconscionability exception have been in the context of a
                    beneficiary’s demand on a bank under a demand guarantee. The situation
                    here is slightly different. The question of unconscionability arises in the
                    context of ABC’s demand on Boustead for an indemnity, but this does not
                    necessarily mean that ODAC’s or BCD’s demands under the PB and APG
                    or the CGs are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    The Court of Appeal in <em>BS
                        Mount Sophia</em> stressed at [41] that unconscionability as an
                    exception has been carved out specifically “in the context of performance
                    bonds”, and is not to be mistaken for the general contractual doctrine of
                    unconscionability. In other words, the nature of the instrument in question is
                    essential to the applicability of the doctrine of unconscionable
                demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    In my view, the unconscionability exception
                    should be similarly extended to a demand for payment made by a bank against its
                    customer under a facility agreement. The FA between ABC and Boustead requires
                    Boustead to indemnify ABC on the latter’s first demand, so the obligation
                    owed by Boustead to ABC is in substance similar to that found in a demand
                    guarantee or performance bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    An English High Court decision, <em>Technical &amp; General Guarantee Company Ltd v Mark
                        Patterson</em> (2003) WL 18223105 (“<em>Technical &amp; General Guarantee</em>”), does not appear to
                    have drawn a distinction between the two situations. In <em>Technical &amp; General Guarantee</em>, a bank was instructed by the
                    customer to grant a performance bond in favour of a third party. The bank did so
                    against the customer granting it a cross-indemnity for sums demanded under the
                    performance bond. The cross-indemnity required the customer to pay the bank on
                    the latter’s first demand, with the demand being conclusive evidence of
                    the amount owing. Mr Launcelot Henderson QC, sitting as a deputy judge of
                    the English High Court, treated the cross-indemnity on the same footing as a
                    performance bond. He said that the effect of the cross-indemnity was that the
                    customer had to put the bank in funds any time, whether or not a demand had been
                    made under the performance bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Further, applying the unconscionability
                    exception to a demand for payment made by a banker on his customer is consistent
                    with the rationale and practical considerations that motivate the
                    unconscionability exception. These were articulated by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>JBE Properties</em> at [10]–[13], and may be
                    distilled into two broad propositions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    First, the function served by a demand
                    guarantee differs from that served by a letter of credit. (In the latter case,
                    fraud is the only recognised exception to the payment against an apparently
                    conforming letter of credit.) A letter of credit is issued as performance of the
                    primary obligation of making payment. It is therefore the “lifeblood of
                    commerce”. A demand guarantee, on the other hand, stands in a different
                    position. It is issued merely as security for a secondary obligation, to pay
                    damages in the event of a breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Second, the one-sided nature of a demand
                    guarantee may result in the beneficiary receiving more than he bargained for.
                    The beneficiary may call on a sum well in excess of the quantum of the
                    beneficiary’s actual or potential loss. Such an excessive or abusive call
                    may have a damaging impact on the party who is required to make the payment.
                    That party may be confronted with liquidity problems and find difficulty
                    recovering the monies from the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Both these considerations apply with equal
                    force to a demand for payment made by a bank against its customer under a
                    facility agreement. Particularly so in the present case. Clause 6.9 of the FA
                    weighs the scales heavily in favour of ABC. ABC is entitled to make a demand
                    against Boustead, requiring Boustead to put ABC in funds, even before ABC has
                    made payment against demands received under the CGs. ABC’s demand is
                    stipulated to be conclusive evidence of the amount that Boustead owes to ABC.
                    There is a potential for abuse or oppression from an excessive or unwarranted
                    call. I do not see any reasons why the unconscionability exception should not
                    apply to demands for payment made by ABC under the FA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there is unconscionability on the facts of this
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    I turn now to whether the factual basis for
                    Boustead’s unconscionability argument is satisfied. Unconscionability has
                    been stated to include elements of abuse, unfairness and dishonesty: <em>Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong</em> [1996] SGHC
                    136 at [5]. It is, however, not possible to define unconscionability apart from
                    a broad indication such as lack of <em>bona fides</em>.
                    What constitutes unconscionability depends on the facts of the case: <em>Dauphin Offshore</em> at [42]. The entire context of the case
                    must be considered, and only if it is “particularly malodorous”
                    will the unconscionability exception be made out: <em>BS Mount
                        Sophia</em> at [21]. A high threshold needs to be met before
                    unconscionability will be established, lest it upset the contractual bargain
                    between the parties and undermine the <em>raison
                        d’être</em> of the demand guarantee: <em>BS Mount
                        Sophia</em> at [39].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    In my view, and on the facts presently
                    before me, the circumstances as a whole are such that it would be unconscionable
                    for ABC to obtain payment from Boustead under the FA. The following facts lead
                    me to this conclusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_a"></a>(a)     ABC has not made payment under the
                        CGs. That is apparent from communications that ABC sent in response to
                        BCD’s CG Demands, reminding the latter that ABC was injuncted from
                        making payment. Indeed, the parties before me proceeded on the common basis
                        that ABC had not yet made payment to BCD.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_b"></a>(b)     It does not appear to me that BCD has made
                        payment to ODAC under the PB or APG. While there is no direct evidence
                        before me on this point, the lack of urgency in the communications between
                        ABC and BCD subsequent to the CG Demands suggests that BCD has not made
                        payment under the PB or APG, and that is an inference I am prepared to
                        draw.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_c"></a>(c)     BCD does
                        not appear to have commenced proceedings against ABC, or attempted to
                        enforce the sums purportedly owing under the CGs against
                    ABC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_d"></a>(d)     BCD has made
                        the CG Demands fraudulently in the reckless sense, and ABC has knowledge of
                        such fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_e"></a>(e)     The civil war in Libya was a <em>force majeure</em>
                        event that would have discharged the Public Works Contract. The internal
                        strife in Libya was to the extent that the Al-Marj project site was pillaged
                        and looted, with Boustead’s staff having to be evacuated (see [8]
                        above). This rendered the performance of the Public Works Contract
                        impossible, and it was to no fault on the part of Boustead. Dr Tumi
                        gave evidence for Boustead on this issue. Unlike his unsatisfactory evidence
                        as to whether Libyan law incorporates the URDG 458 (see [160]–[165]
                        above), his evidence on this issue was addressed in his expert
                            report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> His
                        evidence that the Public Works Contract was discharged was also supported by
                        references to the appropriate articles in the Libyan Civil Code and Libyan
                        court decisions on point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_f"></a>(f)     The ODAC Notices which form the basis
                        of BCD’s demands against ABC under the CGs are very clearly not in
                        accordance with the terms of the PB and APG (see [68]–[69]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_g"></a>(g)     ODAC
                        and thus BCD only pursued their extend or liquidate requests and demands for
                        payment <em>subsequent</em> to the outbreak of unrest
                        leading to the civil war in Libya in 2011, after the Public Works Contract
                        was discharged by <em>force
                    majeure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_h"></a>(h)     There was no prior allegation by ODAC that the JV had breached the
                        Public Works Contract in the material that was placed before me. Indeed, it
                        appears from the evidence that the ODAC Notices were relied upon as demands
                        under the PB and APG only after BCD failed to extend the validity of these
                        instruments. There is no evidence that ODAC was entitled to seek the
                        extension in the unfortunate events which erupted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_i"></a>(i)     The conflict in Libya has persisted,
                        with reports of fighting in Al-Marj as late as
                mid-2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Against this backdrop, if all the parties,
                    including BCD and ODAC were before me, I would have been minded to grant an
                    injunction restraining ODAC from seeking payment from BCD. While the PB and APG
                    are governed by Libyan law, there was no pleading or evidence as to whether
                    Libyan law incorporates the unconscionability exception. I would therefore have
                    presumed that it was similar to Singapore law and granted the injunction. If
                    ODAC was restrained from receiving payment from BCD, then it would follow that
                    BCD should not be entitled to receive payment from ABC, and ABC from
                    Boustead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Even if Libyan law does not have the
                    unconscionability exception, I would have been inclined to restrain ODAC from
                    receiving payment from BCD, and BCD from ABC and ABC from Boustead if all of
                    them were before me. This is because the ODAC Notices are clearly invalid
                    demands and all the parties down the line, including ODAC, must know this.
                    Dr Tumi’s unchallenged evidence was that the ODAC Notices were not in
                    accordance with the terms of the PB and APG and would not have triggered
                    BCD’s liability to ODAC (see [45] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    I am aware that Singapore cases which have
                    applied the unconscionability exception have done so in different factual
                    scenarios. The courts have usually been presented with a three-party scenario
                    (the instructing party, the bank, and the beneficiary), with similar governing
                    laws. The situation here is of greater complexity. There are four parties (two
                    banks). There are multiple laws governing different aspects of the transaction.
                    The relationship between ABC and BCD under the CGs is governed by English law,
                    which does not recognise the unconscionability exception. But I have concluded
                    above that the unconscionability exception applies to the instant case because
                    the FA is governed by Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    I have relied on the fact that BCD acted
                    fraudulently in the reckless sense (at [193(d)] above) in coming to my
                    conclusion of unconscionability. I am aware that this judgment will not bind BCD
                    or ODAC. If BCD were to bring a claim against ABC, whether before the English
                    courts (disputes under the CGs are submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
                    of the English courts, see [26] above) or elsewhere, there is the possibility
                    that that court might not agree with my finding and ABC may be found liable to
                    BCD for the sums demanded under the CGs. There is the risk that ABC may
                    “fall between two stools”, to borrow Ackner LJ’s phrase
                    in <em>United Trading</em> at 566. That was one of the
                    reasons that dissuaded the English Court of Appeal in <em>United
                        Trading</em> from granting the injunctions sought: that a bank which
                    has acted without any hint of dishonesty, who has merely acted on the
                    instructions passed down the line, should not be put in a “perilous
                    situation” (<em>United Trading</em> at
                566).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Even if I am wrong, and BCD did not act
                    fraudulently, I would still have granted an injunction on the ground of
                    unconscionability. Requiring Boustead to pay ABC against a chain of demands that
                    emanates from the clearly invalid ODAC Notices will almost certainly lead to
                    injustice to Boustead. Between that and the risk of ABC facing litigation from
                    BCD and an adverse order from another court, it is my view that an injunction
                    should be granted to preserve the existing state of affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    It remains for me to address
                    Boustead’s reliance on UNSC Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011)
                    mentioned at [8] above. These resolutions were given effect in Singapore by the
                    Monetary Authority of Singapore (Sanctions and Freezing of Assets of Persons
                    – Libya) Regulations 2011 (“the MAS Regulations”) which were
                    issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 8 July 2011. Boustead, in
                    its reply closing submissions, argues that any payment by ABC to BCD would have
                    been in breach of Resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011), as well as the MAS
                        Regulations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span>
                    Boustead argues that <em>BCD’s demands</em> are
                    therefore made unconscionably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    I reject this argument. First, it is well
                    established, and also agreed by both the English law experts, that the
                    unconscionability exception <em>does not</em> form part of
                    English law on demand guarantees. Unconscionability would therefore not be a
                    basis for the restraint of <em>BCD’s demands</em>
                    under the CGs, which are governed by English law, as opposed to ABC’s
                    demand under the FA, which is governed by Singapore law. Second, even if payment
                    to BCD would have been in breach of the UNSC Resolutions and the MAS
                    Regulations, Boustead does not state the effect of the breach on ABC’s
                    obligations to BCD under the CGs, or to Boustead under the FA. This point is
                    therefore inconclusive and does not assist Boustead. While I note that the UN
                    resolutions indicate the severity and urgency of the crisis in Libya in 2011,
                    they do not directly affect the issues before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether unconscionability was sufficiently pleaded by
                Boustead</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    I should mention one point that ABC takes
                    against Boustead on Boustead’s pleadings on unconscionability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> ABC argues that Boustead only pleaded
                    unconscionability in relation to the demands made by ODAC and/or BCD under the
                    PB and APG or CGs. Boustead did not plead that <em>ABC</em>
                    made the FA Demand unconscionably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Boustead’s amended statement of claim
                    pleads that the demands made “by ODAC and/or BCD for payment under CG38
                    and/or CG39 [are] unconscionable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> The demands are said to be unconscionable
                    because ODAC made demands in excess of what it was owed, even though the Public
                    Works Contract was discharged as a consequence of the Libyan war, a <em>force majeure</em> event.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> Boustead only expressly mentions
                    ABC as having made the FA Demand unconscionably in its opening statement and
                    closing submissions. In Boustead’s opening statement, Boustead stated that
                    in the light of the “various suspicious circumstances” which
                    Boustead had alerted ABC to, ABC’s conduct in making the FA Demand and
                    issuing the EOD Notice were unconscionable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> Boustead’s closing submissions
                    state in passing that ABC’s unconscionable conduct should not be
                        condoned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>
                    Boustead’s reply closing submissions take the point further by stating
                    that the FA Demand is unconscionable, presumably because the FA was granted on a
                    back-to-back basis to the CGs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    Although Boustead should have included a
                    plea that the FA Demand was unconscionable in the circumstances, I am of the
                    view that this omission is not fatal and does not preclude Boustead from raising
                    unconscionability in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The reason why Boustead may rely on
                    unconscionability is that the ODAC Notices were not valid demands in the first
                    place. There is no evidence suggesting that the JV was in breach of contract or
                    that ODAC was entitled to an extension of the PB or APG in the circumstances.
                    ODAC is not entitled to payment. This is known to BCD and ABC. Yet any payment
                    by Boustead to ABC will, as stated above, flow to BCD, then eventually to
                    ODAC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA are invalid under
                s 2(2) of the UCTA as unreasonable exclusions of liability for negligence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    My conclusions on the fraud and
                    unconscionability arguments both provide bases for the grant of injunctive
                    relief. I turn to address Boustead’s contract arguments in
                brief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Boustead argues that cll 6.6, 6.8 and
                    6.9 of the FA are invalid under s 2(2) of the UCTA. Section 2(2) of the
                    UCTA applies to loss other than personal injury or death. It states that a
                    person cannot exclude or restrict his liability for negligence except in so far
                    as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness. Boustead
                    argues that the clauses have the effect of excluding or restricting ABC’s
                    liability for negligence and that they are not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    In order for a clause to fall within the
                    purview of s 2(2) of the UCTA, it has to be an exclusion of liability for
                    negligence on a proper construction. The court is concerned with the substance
                    rather than the form of the clause. The Court of Appeal in <em>Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen</em> [2013] 4 SLR 886 stated at [68]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he UCTA simply addresses itself to clause which “exclude or
                        restrict” a liability, obligation or duty. The legislative eye is
                        firmly set on the substantive <em>effect</em> of a term
                        or notice, rather than on its <em>form</em> or
                        identification. Seen in this light, the only question which arises for a
                        court is whether a term or notice has the effect of excluding or restricting
                        the imposition of a duty of care in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The court must therefore ascertain the effect of the clause in
                        question and determine whether or not it is, in substance, an exclusion of

                    clauses which Boustead says are exclusions or restrictions of liability and to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 6.6 requires Boustead to indemnify ABC on demand
                        for any loss that ABC may suffer, or any expenses it may incur in relation
                        to any of the CGs that were issued under the FA. It is unclear as to whether
                        the indemnity is required to be made on ABC’s first demand, or on
                        proof of loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Clause 6.8 of the FA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.8

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The operative phrase in cl 6.8 is that ABC shall have no

                        to it. Under this clause, ABC is therefore not required to ascertain the
                        truth or falsity of the facts which are represented in the documents
                        presented to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    Finally, cl 6.9 of the FA
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.9    
              <u>Indemnity</u>: Without
                            prejudice to any provisions in this Agreement, the Borrower hereby
                            undertakes and agrees with [ABC] that <em>it shall
                                immediately upon demand from</em> [<em>ABC</em>] (which demand shall, in the absence of manifest
                            error, <em>be conclusive evidence of the amount
                                owing</em>), reimburse and/or indemnify [ABC] for any amounts
                            demanded or paid under any [counter-guarantee], by paying such amount to
                            [ABC]. ... The Borrower’s obligations to pay such amount demanded
                            by ABC shall be absolute and unconditional <em>irrespective of any acts, matters or things, including any disputes
                                of the Borrower concerning the merits or validity or propriety of
                                any such demands or claims</em> or any payment made and
                            notwithstanding any counter-claims or set off or any other rights the
                            Borrower has or may have (<em>whether or not</em>
                                [<em>ABC</em>] <em>has notice of
                                any of the acts, matters or things</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 6.9 clause relates only to <em>amounts demanded or paid under any CG</em> (in contrast to the
                        more widely-framed cl 6.6, discussed above). Clause 6.9 requires
                        Boustead to pay ABC “immediately upon demand”, which demand
                        shall be “conclusive evidence of the amount
                    owing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Construing the clauses as a whole, the
                    contractual mechanism for payment between Boustead and ABC emerges.
                    Clause 6.9 of the FA requires Boustead to put ABC in funds <em>immediately upon demand</em>, but only for sums <em>demanded or paid under the CGs</em>. Clause 6.8 of the
                    FA, which states that ABC has no obligation to make any factual determinations
                    in relation to the documents presented to ABC, complements the on-demand nature
                    of cl 6.9. ABC is thus able to act on the apparent conformity of demands
                    presented to it under the CGs to make demands on Boustead under cl 6.9 of
                    the FA. There is no further need for ABC to make factual determination of the
                    accuracy or truth of facts stated within the demands under the
                CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    While cl 6.6 of the FA appears to
                    suggest that Boustead is to indemnify ABC only on proof of loss, this is to be
                    read together with cl 6.9 of the FA. In any event, both parties proceeded
                    on the basis that the FA requires Boustead to pay ABC on demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA are exclusions of
                liability for negligence and if so whether they are reasonable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Boustead argues that these clauses exclude
                    liability for negligence. Boustead says that cl 6.8 excludes “all
                    liabilities” on the part of ABC to “make any factual
                    determinations as to the validity or genuineness or notice or accuracy or
                    correctness of any certificate or statement or notice or other document”.
                    This includes liability for negligence. Further, cll 6.6 and 6.9 require
                    Boustead to indemnify ABC even in cases of negligence or fraud. They are
                    therefore restrictions of ABC’s liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Boustead goes on to argue that cll 6.6
                    and 6.9 both have the effect of allowing ABC to make a claim against Boustead
                    “without conducting the reasonable examination expected of it ... or even
                    if it had no basis to do so and no corresponding obligations to meet under the
                    Counter Guarantees”. Boustead contends that it would have to indemnify or
                    reimburse ABC where the bank onward transmits a demand even if ABC has knowledge
                    that the demand under the CGs is invalid or made fraudulently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    I do not accept Boustead’s submissions
                    that cll 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA are exclusions of liability for
                    negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    I begin first with cl 6.8 of the FA. I
                    have mentioned above that cl 6.8 obviates the need for ABC to make factual
                    determinations as to the accuracy of statements or facts in the documents
                    presented to it. ABC is therefore entitled to take the documents at face value,
                    and is not required to look behind them to make factual determinations. It is
                    not an exclusion of liability for negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    I turn next to cll 6.6 and 6.9 of the
                    FA. As mentioned above at [213], both sides proceeded on the basis that the
                    express terms of the FA require Boustead to pay on demand. This is subject to
                    the argument about implied terms. While cl 6.6 appears to be an indemnity
                    clause, it is to be read together with cl 6.9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Clause 6.9 states that Boustead’s
                    obligation to pay the demanded amount shall be absolute and unconditional,
                    “irrespective of any acts, matters or things”, including any
                    “disputes of [Boustead] concerning the merits or validity or propriety of
                    any such demands”, “whether or not [ABC] has notice of any of the
                    acts, matters or things”. While the clause may have the effect of
                    requiring Boustead to make payment to ABC even if ABC makes a demand under the
                    FA negligently, that does not mean it excludes liability for negligence.
                    Clause 6.9 merely requires Boustead to put ABC in funds on demand,
                    regardless of any dispute Boustead might have. The clause does not purport to
                    prevent Boustead from subsequently making a claim against ABC for breach of
                    duty. It does not purport to exclude ABC’s liability to Boustead in that
                    respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    It is therefore my view that cll 6.6,
                    6.8 and 6.9 are not exclusions of liability for negligence. They are therefore
                    not caught by s 2(2) of the UCTA. Even if the clauses are exclusions of
                    liability, I would have been minded to hold that they are reasonable. They are
                    consistent with the mechanism requiring payment on demand and the fundamental
                    principle of demand guarantees that banks are only concerned with documents and
                    not facts. I should also mention that there was no suggestion that the clauses
                    entitle ABC to receive payment even if it makes a demand under the FA
                    fraudulently (<em>ie</em>, recklessly). ABC accepts that a
                    fraudulent demand would disentitle it from receiving payment under the
                        FA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether ABC’s claim against Boustead is precluded by terms that
                are implied in the FA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Finally, there is the issue of the
                    implication of terms into the FA. Boustead argues that two terms should be
                    implied into the FA:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_a"></a>(a)     To examine with reasonable care all
                        documents presented under and in connection with the CGs. ABC would,
                        therefore, only make demands against Boustead under the FA if the documents
                        presented fully and strictly complied with the terms of the CGs (“the
                        first implied term”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_b"></a>(b)     Not to make payment under the CGs and/or make a demand
                        against Boustead for payment of any sum under the CGs if ABC has knowledge
                        of the lack of validity, genuineness, accuracy or correctness of any
                        statement, notice, or other documents delivered with respect to or under the
                        CGs and/or knowledge of fraudulent conduct in connection with any demand
                        made under the CGs (“the second implied
                term”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    The process of implication is an exercise of
                    giving effect to the parties’
                    <em>presumed</em> intentions: <em>Sembcorp
                        Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</em>
                    [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<em>Sembcorp Marine</em>”)
                    at [93]. It necessarily follows that a term which contradicts the express terms
                    of the contract will not be implied: <em>Foo Jong Peng and others
                        v Phua Kiah Mai and another</em> [2012] 4 SLR 1267 at [35]. A term
                    will be implied only to fill a gap in the contract. The implication of a term
                    involves a three-step process, <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at
                    [101]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the
                            contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court
                            discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the
                            gap.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    At the second step, the court considers whether it
                            is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in
                            order to give the contract efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Finally, the court considers the specific term to
                            be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the
                            need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of
                            course!” had the proposed term been put to them at [the] time of
                            the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then,
                            the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Even if the first implied term exists, it
                    does not assist Boustead, as I have concluded that the CG Demands did comply
                    with the terms of the CGs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The first part of the second implied term
                        (<em>ie</em>, that ABC is not to make payment under the
                    CGs and/or make a demand against Boustead for payment of any sum under the CGs
                    if ABC has knowledge of the lack of validity, genuineness, accuracy or
                    correctness of any statement, notice, or other documents delivered with respect
                    to or under the CGs) seeks to modify the fraud exception under common law in
                    that it would be sufficient if ABC has knowledge of the lack of correctness with
                    respect to the CG Demands even if that knowledge does not amount to fraud. The
                    second part is the same as the fraud exception under common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    Since the common law already has the fraud
                    exception and Singapore law applies the doctrine of unconscionability, there is
                    no reason to imply either part of the second implied term even if there were a
                    gap because the parties did not contemplate the gap, which I
                doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Boustead’s arguments on both implied
                    terms fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    I will briefly summarise my conclusions
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_a"></a>(a)     ABC is injuncted from receiving
                        payment from Boustead under the FA Demand and is injuncted from making
                        payment to BCD on BCD’s CG Demands. This is because the FA Demand was
                        made fraudulently in the reckless sense, or alternatively, the circumstances
                        are such that it would be unconscionable for ABC to receive payment of
                        monies from Boustead, which will eventually be paid to ODAC. BCD made the CG
                        Demands fraudulently in the reckless sense, and ABC had knowledge of
                        BCD’s fraud at the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clauses 6.6, 6.8 and 6.9 of the FA are not
                        invalid under the UCTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_c"></a>(c)     There is no basis for the implication of the terms that
                        Boustead is seeking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    Boustead also prays for declarations that:
                    (a) it is discharged from all liabilities in relation to the CGs that it owes to
                    ABC under the FA; and (b) the EOD Notice is invalid. There is no need for the
                    former and I dismiss it. In relation to the latter, since I have concluded that
                    ABC made the FA Demand fraudulently in the reckless sense, ABC’s EOD
                    Notice was wrongly issued. I will therefore grant the declaration that the EOD
                    Notice is invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    The interlocutory injunction granted on
                    30 August 2012 is discharged as it is replaced by the injunctions ordered
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    I dismiss ABC’s claim for the payment
                    of the sums of US$3,760,387.95 and US$15,021,093.25 and its prayer for a
                    declaration of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
