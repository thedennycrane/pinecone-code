</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On 31 August 2009, in the midst of the USA proceedings, [X] breached that joint custody order by removing the twins from California to Singapore without [Y]’s permission or a court order. As child abduction is a criminal offence in the USA, an arrest warrant and an INTERPOL alert was issued against [X].

After contentious proceedings, the then Family Court ordered in March 2011 that the twins be returned to [Y], in the USA. Until recently, [Y] lived in the USA with the twins. [X] had weekly visitation rights to the twins. [X] said that when she first returned to the USA in May 2011, she was sentenced to jail for 52 days on a charge of deprivation of child custody and put on probation for five years. After her release, she travelled to and from Singapore to see the twins and then decided to move back permanently to the USA in November 2011 to obtain an order enabling her to see the twins every week for four hours in a monitored centre for which she had to pay 50% of the costs. She said that she was arrested in July 2012 by the USA immigration authorities because [Y] reported that her green card was no longer valid as the marriage had been annulled. As her passport was confiscated by the USA immigration authorities in August 2012, she was not able to leave the USA.

Parties agree that [X] cannot avail herself of ancillary relief pursuant to a nullity of marriage under Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”), which applies only to marriages dissolved or annulled with effect from 2011. Accordingly, the only basis on which [X] can lay claim to a beneficial interest in the Property is under the law of property and trusts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is in this context that the parties dispute the beneficial ownership of the Property in these twin originating summonses before me. In OS240, [Y] seeks a declaration, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that [X] holds her share in the Property on resulting trust for him. For completeness, I will also consider whether the transfer can be avoided on the basis of mistake. In OS574, [X] seeks a declaration that she and [Y] each hold an equal beneficial interest in the Property, or alternatively a declaration that she holds a beneficial interest in the Property in a proportion calculated based on her various financial contributions. She cites various legal bases for her claim: a gift (or a presumption of advancement), a common intention constructive trust, and proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The submissions of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 [X] argues that she became the beneficial owner of a half-share in the Property when [Y] made her a joint tenant of the Property in July 2001. She argues that the direct evidence shows that [Y] intended to make a gift of that half-share to her, or that the Court can infer a common intention on the parties’ part for the Property to be beneficially owned in equal shares under a common intention constructive trust, or that the presumption of advancement applies. [X] further argues that [Y] cannot set aside the transfer in July 2001 based on a mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 [Y] disputes that [X] is a beneficial owner of a half-share in the Property. He argues that the presumption of advancement does not apply, that there is no common intention on the beneficial ownership of the Property, and that the direct evidence does not show any intention on [Y]’s part to make a gift of a half-share in the Property to [X]. He also adds that [X] cannot raise proprietary estoppel for a lack of representation and detrimental reliance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether [X] has a beneficial interest by virtue of a gift, common intention constructive trust or presumption of advancement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The main issue in these originating summonses is whether [X] has a beneficial interest by virtue of a gift, common intention constructive trust or presumption of advancement. The relevant approach and principles were set out by V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”), as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">160 In view of our discussion above, a property dispute involving parties who have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property and who have not executed a declaration of trust as to how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned can be broadly analysed using the following steps in relation to the available evidence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Is there sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property? If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arises). If the answer is “no”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest is held.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Regardless of whether the answer to (a) is “yes” or “no”, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then: (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is registered in Y’s sole name (ie, Y will be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is registered in their joint names. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Notwithstanding the situation at the time the property was acquired, is there sufficient and compelling evidence of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in a proportion which is different from that in which the beneficial interest was held at the time of acquisition of the property? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in one of the modes set out at (b)-(e) above, depending on which is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I will apply these principles in the following sequence. First, I will assess parties’ direct financial contributions to determine if a resulting trust arises, and if so, in what proportions. Next, I will consider whether the presumption of advancement applies. Finally, I will consider whether there is sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of advancement and establish parties’ common intentions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there is sufficient evidence of [X]’s direct financial contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As mentioned above (at [10]), <span class="font-italic">all</span> payments for the Property were made by [Y]. This suggests that the presumption of a resulting trust should arise in favour of [Y], such that [Y] is presumed to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property on the basis of his direct financial contributions. However, there is the issue of whether [X] made any direct financial contributions by virtue of the fact that the inclusion of her name as a joint tenant allowed [Y] to enjoy a reduced interest rate on his mortgage loan with DBS Bank, which I will examine in detail. I take the view that there is sufficient evidence of [X]’s direct financial contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Springette v Defoe</span> [1992] FLR 388, the parties purchased a council house as joint tenants. The purchase price had been discounted by £10,045 from its estimated market value because the plaintiff wife had been a tenant of the council for over 11 years. In attributing the beneficial interest in the property, the UK Court of Appeal considered that sum to be the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">direct financial contribution</span> to the <span class="font-italic">gross</span> (rather than <span class="font-italic">actual or</span> <span class="font-italic">discounted</span>) purchase price of the property (at 391 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Dillon LJ, at 395 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Steyn LJ and at 396 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sir Christopher Slade (agreeing with Dillon and Steyn LJJ)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is undisputed that the saving of bank interest was at least one purpose of adding [X]’s name as a joint tenant of the Property, and it is undisputed that [Y] enjoyed a lower bank interest for this purpose. This suffices to prove [X]’s direct financial contribution in the proportion of the interest saved to the purchase price of the Property had there been no savings on interest. Accordingly, under the resulting analysis in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [160(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)]) and subject to the later steps of analysis as set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, [X] would have a beneficial interest in the Property in the proportion of the interest saved by [Y] to the purchase price of the Property had there been no savings on interest. The precise figures can be worked out at the valuation stage, which parties have agreed will be done at a later stage if and after the issue of parties’ rights therein have been determined in [X]’s favour. However, this will not be necessary, as I later find on the basis of direct evidence that parties had a common intention for [Y] to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property (see [47]–[85] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the presumption of advancement applies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108, V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) made some seminal observations regarding the presumption of advancement in the spousal context:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Spousal relationships</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 … The husband-wife relationship which attracts the presumption of advancement has been subsequently extended to <span class="font-weight-bold">include a situation where the transferor or contributor husband is</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">engaged</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">to be married to the beneficiary wife and they do not subsequently break their engagement</span> to marry each other.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 In<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Moate v Moate</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[1948] 2 All ER 486 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Moate</span>”), Jenkins J explained the compelling logic of this extension at 487 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I can see no practical distinction … between a transfer by an intending husband to an intending wife and a transfer as between a husband and a wife. The reason for presuming advancement is stronger where the gift is made in contemplation of the marriage before it is actually solemnised than it is where the transaction is post-nuptial. It seems to me the presumption would be, in the former case, that the intending husband is making a gift to the lady in consideration of the marriage, a gift by way of wedding present which he intends to take effect in her favour beneficially provided the marriage is duly solemnised. I, therefore, hold that the presumption in this case is that the husband intended this to be a provision by way of gift to his wife provided the marriage was duly solemnised.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The High Court of Australia has similarly held in<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Wirth v Wirth</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>(1956) 98 CLR 228 (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Wirth</span>”) that a transfer of property by a prospective husband to his intended wife made in contemplation of the marriage for which they had contracted raises a presumption of advancement just as a similar transfer made after the celebration of the marriage raises the same presumption. In coming to this conclusion, Dixon CJ remarked at 238:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">To say that a transfer of property to an intended wife made in contemplation of the marriage raised a presumption of a resulting trust but a similar transfer made immediately after the celebration of the marriage raised a presumption of advancement involves almost a paradoxical distinction that does not accord with reason and can find a justification only on the ground that the doctrine depends in categories closed for historical reasons. That is not characteristic of doctrines of equity.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 <span class="font-weight-bold">It appears, therefore, that the courts are willing to modify and extend the established categories of relationships to which the presumption of advancement applies, to accommodate the contemporary social climate and the particular circumstances in the cases which come before the court</span>; a steadfast and rigid adherence to the historical application of the presumption has been rightly rejected.

He stated at 793:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not know how this presumption first arose, but it would seem that the judges who first gave effect to it must have thought either that husbands so commonly intended to make gifts in the circumstances in which the presumption arises that it was proper to assume this where there was no evidence, or that wives’ economic dependence on their husbands made it necessary as a matter of public policy to give them this advantage. I can see no other reasonable basis for the presumption. These considerations have largely lost their force under present conditions, and, unless the law has lost all flexibility so that the courts can no longer adapt it to changing conditions, the strength of the presumption must have been much diminished.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the same case, Lord Upjohn acknowledged at 813 that the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement “have been criticised as being out of touch with the realities of today”, but he nevertheless remained optimistic that “when properly understood and properly applied to the circumstances of today”, the presumptions “remain as useful as ever in solving questions of title”. Nevertheless, he appeared to have regarded the ready rebuttal of the presumptions by “comparatively slight evidence” as the proper application of these presumptions then (at 814).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76 Locally, the Court of Appeal recently considered the presumption of advancement in some detail in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Low Gim Siah v Low Geok Khim</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Low Gim Siah</span>”). Chan Sek Keong CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, accepted that <span class="font-weight-bold">the presumption of advancement was generally of varying strength in different circumstances</span>; he opined at [33] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he amount of evidence required to rebut the presumption would depend on the strength of the presumption,<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span>, how readily the court would be prepared to make the presumption. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Chan CJ further pronounced on the application of the presumption in certain spousal relationships at [43]–[44] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... In our view, it is correct to say that the cases where the presumption of advancement was held to have lost its robustness or diminished in importance were cases concerning joint contributions by married couples in acquiring the matrimonial home or properties acquired using joint savings. They were not concerned with the traditional and well-established categories of father-and-child and husband-and-wife relationships where one party is under a moral or equitable obligation to support the other party. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The presumption of advancement has been applied in England in such relationships for over two centuries and justified on the basis of a<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">moral or equitable obligation</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>on the part of one to care for the other. Such moral obligations do not change even if social conditions change. Hence, we find it difficult to accept an argument that in modern Singapore, fathers and husbands have somehow changed their paternal or marital obligations so radically that the presumption is no longer applicable or should not be applied. There is no doubt that many married women in Singapore are financially independent of their husbands. But there are also many of them who are not or who choose to be housewives in order to look after their husbands, their children and their homes. … <span class="font-weight-bold">In our view, in the case of such relationships, there is no reason to treat the presumption of advancement as having lost its robustness or diminished in its vigour, and there is no reason why it should not be applied to resolve questions of title in the absence of any evidence indicating otherwise.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis [in italics] in original]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77 We maintain the view expressed in<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Low Gim Siah</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">The presumption of advancement is still very relevant today in the established (both traditional and extended) categories of relationships; it is the strength of the presumption that should vary with the circumstances in accordance with modern social conditions.</span> Thus, on this point, we must respectfully depart from the learned trial judge’s bare assertion that the Singapore courts had moved away from the presumption of advancement and that the presumption was no longer applicable in modern times unless there was evidence to support it (see<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[16] above).

This affidavit was filed in Originating Summons Family No 148 of 2009, which was [Y]’s application for access to the children; the issue of [Y]’s knowledge that [X] had not received her <span class="font-italic">decree absolute</span> was one that was incidental and I am accordingly prepared to discount the fact that [Y] did not reply to [X]’s claims. As stated, [Y]’s knowledge could have related only to the time that [X]’s USA visa application was made (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, September 1999), and not to the time of their marriage as [Y] could have assumed that the <span class="font-italic">decree absolute</span> would have been granted by the date of marriage.

[X], in her reply affidavit, did not respond on or contradict this point. It bears noting that as [X] would have received the <span class="font-italic">decree</span><span class="font-italic"> absolute</span> only after 6 December 1999, that it is probable that she may have known, if not at the time of the marriage then at some time after 6 December 1999, that the marriage of 23 November 1999 was not valid. Accordingly, I find that [Y], if not [X], conducted himself on the basis that they were each other’s legal spouses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I do not think the analysis is changed by the fact that [Y] wrongly thought that the twins were his biological children. As I discussed above at [15], [Y] was for all practical intents and purposes their father. As seen from the proceedings that have taken place, [Y]’s care of the twins does not seem to have been swayed by the fact that they were not his biological children; he fought for custody of them in the USA, and when they were taken to Singapore by [X]. After obtaining a USA court order for sole custody of the twins, [Y] applied in Singapore for the twins to be returned to him in the USA. It is noted that in the Child Evaluation Report of 21 August 2009 made in the USA, it was stated that [Y] believed that he was the biological father of the twins, and that regardless of the results of any test, “his commitment to raising the boys as his own would not be altered.”

</div> Apart from the Property, [Y] and [X] also did not jointly own any properties despite whatever they may have discussed about their finances. At the outset, it seems more likely than not that the parties planned their family finances together but conducted their financial transactions separately. [X] suggests that the Property was one of the fruits of their financial planning (specifically their plans to make joint investments), but I am not convinced. [Y] entered the agreement to purchase the Property in August 1997, many months before he met [X] for the first time. It may be that [Y] decided to let [X] have a share of the beneficial interest of the Property at a later date, either pursuant to an agreement or a gift. However, I will explain below why I do not think that this was the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The direct evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Besides the fact that a joint tenancy is more consistent with a trust arrangement than a tenancy-in-common, a few other lines of evidence also suggest that [Y] did not intend [X] to have any real interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(I) [Y]’s dealings with the Property and the Pasadena property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 [X] argues that [Y] acknowledged her beneficial interest in the Property in the way he conferred upon her an ownership interest, and by the way he dealt with the Pasadena property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, she says that the fact that she was made a joint tenant (and not a tenant-in-common) of the Property is consistent with her account of her discussion with [Y] in 2001 and, coupled with the fact that [Y] was legally represented at the time, this was evidence that [Y] intended [X] to beneficially own the Property. This is fortified by the instrument of transfer, which [X] argues is a clear statement that the Property would be jointly owned by [Y] and her.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, these arguments have little force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The mere fact of joint tenancy (and the attendant fact of the right of survivorship) does little to prove the parties’ intention as to the beneficial ownership of the property. At best, it does not overtly contradict [X]’s claim that [Y] intended for her and her children to be able to live in the Property should anything happen to him. Where joint tenants have made unequal contributions to the purchase price of the property, they are presumed to beneficially own a share of the property proportionate to their respective contributions to its purchase price (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [83]; <span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew</span> [2012] 2 SLR 831 at [14]–[15]). The strongest argument that [X] can make here is probably that no consideration actually passed from [X] to [Y], although the consideration stated in the instrument of transfer was $400,000. However, this fact does not strongly suggest that [Y] intended to gift to [X] a share in the Property at least in the proportion of $400,000 to its then market value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 [X]’s comparison of the Property to Pasadena property also suffers from a crucial flaw — it is distinguishable on the basis of the times when the properties were acquired. The Pasadena property was acquired in 2004, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the parties registered their marriage in 1999. According to both expert affidavits before me, under California law, community property is all property acquired by a married person <span class="font-italic">during marriage while domiciled in California</span>. This means that the Pasadena property would have been community property on the assumption that [X] and [Y] were validly married. On the other hand, the Property was acquired in 1997, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before [X] and [Y] even started dating. The parties never lived in it and never improved it. It would not have been community property under Californian law (or, for that matter, matrimonial property under Singaporean law).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In these circumstances, I take the view that the way that the parties dealt with the Property (or the Pasadena Property) does <span class="font-italic">not</span> show that [Y] intended to give [X] a half-share of the Property, or that they shared a common intention that the parties would each have a half-share in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(II) The parties’ statements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Another aspect of the evidence which is quite telling is the parties’ various statements around the time that matrimonial proceedings in the USA were ongoing. At the outset, it appears that both parties proceeded on the (erroneous) basis that the Property was community property on the basis that their marriage was valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Thus, on [X]’s part, this was made clear in her response to [Y]’s Form Interrogatories dated 21 April 2005.

</div> It would have been natural (and self-serving) for [Y] to state as his primary position that the Court should consider his obligations on the Property when ordering spousal support. This is in fact [Y]’s own characterisation of the declaration, that he was “merely seeking to convince the Court to reduce the amount of child and spousal support that I was ordered to pay considering all the obligations I have” [emphasis omitted].

</div> His prayer that the Court order [X] to bear half of the liability commencing on the date of separation was an alternative position. The attorney’s letter in 2007 was made on the same assumption. Further, [Y]’s attorney was conveying a settlement proposal. As for [Y]’s e-mail of 2 June 2009, the very brief phrase that “you and I have to pay the shortage” is not very probative of the fact that [Y] regarded [X] to have a beneficial interest in the Property. I am prepared to accept [Y]’s explanation to the effect that he was simply passing on the message from the bank.

</div> The most likely inference in my view is that [Y] was inflicting stress on [X] in as acute a form as possible (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on her finances). I say this because the parties were in the midst of a bitter custody struggle at this point in time ([X] had raised the fact of the twins’ paternity in the USA proceedings, but the USA courts had not reached a determination yet), and I find it hard to see another plausible reason for [Y] to have sent this e-mail to [X]. Specifically, I do <span class="font-italic">not</span> find it convincing to say that [Y] intended to acknowledge [X]’s half-share in the Property because he sent this e-mail <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the ongoing matrimonial proceedings. Shortly after this letter in June 2009, [X] took the twins with her to Singapore on 31 August 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second</span>, the fact that [Y] considered the Property to be community property does not say very much. This, as it turns out, seems to have been an erroneous assumption because there was no “transmutation” under Californian law that would have changed its nature from being the separate property of [Y] to the community property of the parties as parties were not legally married. Further, the mere fact that the Property is community property is not dispositive (or even suggestive) of the respective shares that [X] and [Y] have in it; that would still depend on Californian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third</span>, and very tellingly, [X], despite also stating the Property to be community property (see above at [62]), admitted rather early on (and quite categorically) that she was named as a joint tenant of the Property for the sake of interest savings only.

</div> These facts are also consistent with (and perhaps complement) [Y]’s account in his supplemental declaration that [X]’s name was added to the property because [Y] “had to refinance”. Additionally, in some ways, [X]’s USA declaration was even more accurate than [Y]’s supplemental declaration. In particular, I note that it is accepted in this proceedings that parties never lived in the Property (see above at [9]). Yet, [Y]’s declaration wrongly claimed that the couple “had lived in that property”, while [X]’s USA declaration states correctly that the couple “never lived in it”. Accordingly, I take the view that [X]’s statement strongly corroborates [Y]’s claims that he had named her as an owner only to enjoy interest savings, and that [X] was never meant to have any beneficial interest in the Property. It also bears noting that [X], like [Y], was a divorcee, who had gone through divorce proceedings, albeit in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For this reason, and also for the reason that the parties never lived in the Property, I also take the view that her claim in these proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that [Y] wanted to make her a joint tenant of the Property so that she and her children would have a place to stay should anything happen to him) is an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In these circumstances, I take the view that the parties’ statements and declarations do <span class="font-italic">not</span> show that [Y] intended to give [X] a half-share of the Property, instead, these documents show that parties shared a common intention that [Y] would be the sole beneficial owner of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(III) [X]’s sale of the HDB Flat and contribution to the household expenses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Next, [X] claims that she sold the HDB Flat so that she could co-own the Property with [Y].

Thus, pursuant to such an agreement, she paid for various household expenses between January 2001 and July 2004 (such as the maids’ salaries, groceries, marketing, petrol and other miscellany).

</div> [X] gave various reasons. The first reason was that the parties were unlikely to stay in the HDB Flat. She says that although the prevailing HDB regulations then allowed concurrent ownership in the HDB Flat and the Property, she would be required to live in the HDB Flat. However, [Y] preferred not to live in the HDB Flat because it was too small for seven persons (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, [X], [Y], the three children and two domestic helpers) to reside.

Although the <span class="font-italic">decree nisi</span> in her earlier divorce proceedings required her ex-husband to transfer his share in the HDB Flat to her in repayment of the funds used from his Central Provident Fund account, this was not done as [X] did not have enough funds to pay her ex-husband.

Moreover, even when the parties moved back to Singapore, they first stayed in the HDB Flat until they moved to her Family Home in March 2001.

I am therefore inclined to think that it was far more by coincidence than by design that the date of the supposed contract for [X] to become a joint tenant of the Property (4 April 2001) and the completion accounts for the HDB Flat (5 April 2001) were proximate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 There remains the possibility that, at around April 2001, [X] decided to make the best of the forthcoming sale proceeds of the HDB Flat and, to that end, agreed with [Y] that she would pay for the household expenses while [Y] paid for the mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I have some doubts about the extent of her claim, besides the fact that [Y] denied having discussed with [X] about whether she was to contribute towards the purchase price of the Property.

On the other hand, while I do not draw any adverse inference from the lack of receipts, the expenses that have been listed seem inflated. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fourth</span>, the sale proceeds of the HDB Flat seems to have gone towards the setting up of the Business in 2003. In her response to the Form Interrogatories, she stated that the Business was acquired in May 2003 using money she had acquired from her previous marriage. [X] explained that she would drain her savings if she continued to pay for household expenses and hence she invested what appears to be $30,000 in the Business to generate some income to top up the difference between the sum that [Y] was giving her (this had fallen from $2,500 to $1,000 per month) and the household expenses. In the event, [X] suffered trade <span class="font-italic">losses</span> of $13,661 and $12,739.44 in calendar years 2004 and 2005 — she denies that the sale proceeds of the HDB Flat went towards supporting the losses suffered by her business, but fails to explain how these losses were settled. I therefore take the view that a large part of the cash proceeds from the sale of the HDB Flat went towards setting up the Business and settling its losses, despite [X]’s claims to the contrary.

On this issue, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [114], citing Robert Pearce &amp; John Stevens, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Trusts and Equitable Obligations</span> (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2006) at p 243, observed that “indirect” contributions may constitute sufficient detriment such that the court will impose a constructive trust if there was an express common intention to share the ownership of the land. However, I find little evidence of a common intention in [X]’s favour; in fact, as I had indicated above, the evidence supports a finding of an opposite common intention by parties: a common intention for [Y] to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property (at [69]–[72]). To find a common intention in favour of [X] would also be in strong contrast to the fact that the parties had quite clearly delineated their finances, and would also be odd considering that the parties never spent a day living in the Property. Moreover, [X]’s contributions (if any) are not even indirect contributions in relation to the property (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the form of repairs, insurance or taxes). Ultimately, I consider that [X]’s contributions should have been vindicated in matrimonial proceedings. She has, however, chosen to commence matrimonial proceedings at a particular time in a particular jurisdiction. The governing matrimonial regime unfortunately does not permit financial relief consequent to the <span class="font-italic">annulment</span> of a marriage and [X] must be taken to accept it. A court is ill-suited to take cognisance of these contributions in the context of a trust analysis, and it would be very slow indeed to mimic the putative outcome of a division of matrimonial assets had [Y] and [X] been validly married (and, later, divorced).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sale of [X]’s HDB Flat or her alleged contributions to household expenses would entitle her to a beneficial interest in the Property whether or not by way of a constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(IV) [X]’s Notice of Assessment for Year of Assessment 2015</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Finally, [X] argues that she should enjoy beneficial ownership of the Property because she was made to share in its income tax liabilities.

[X]’s share of the rental income for 2014 would therefore be half of the rental income for eight full months and an extra 14 days in a 30-day month — that would be ½ × ($3,500 × (8 + 14/30)), which works out to be $14,816.67.

</div> From the various tax assessments tendered in evidence, this does not appear to be a token statement. [X]’s claim that [Y] had filed [X]’s tax returns on her behalf therefore seems very unlikely to me; that is tantamount to an accusation that [Y] had accessed [X]’s online account without authorisation. It is plausible that one is privy to the passwords used by his or her spouse, but it is surprising if this remains the case for parties in the midst of an acrimonious divorce. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Next</span>, the tax returns were filed shortly after [Y] filed OS240 on 17 March 2015. This lends credence to the hypothesis that [X]’s tax filing was a manoeuvre to resist [Y]’s claim. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third</span>, the picture becomes even clearer when these facts are juxtaposed against the fact that [Y] had not filed any tax returns in Singapore since Year of Assessment 2011, after being informed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) by a letter dated 31 January 2011 that he need not do so if his total annual income did not exceed $22,000.

</div> In the circumstances, with regards to the equitable doctrine of mistake, I do not need to address the mistake on the twins’ paternity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I turn now to examine the relevant case law. In <span class="font-italic">Pitt v Holt</span> [2013] 2 AC 108, the first claimant (Mrs Pitt) received damages as a result of a settlement in an action for damages fallowing an accident involving her husband. As receiver and with the authority of the Court of Protection, she settled the monies received on a discretionary trust, the trustees of which were the first defendant and both Mr and Mrs Pitt. As the trust did not comply with the requirements of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 and Mrs Pitt and her advisors never considered the same, large inheritance tax liabilities ensued after Mr Pitt’s death. The Pitts sought to set aside the settlement on the basis that Mrs Pitt had failed to consider the material consideration of the inheritance tax consequences and would not have entered into the settlement if she had appreciated these consequences or, in the alternative, equitable relief on the ground of mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The UK Supreme Court distinguished a mistake from forgetfulness, inadvertence, misprediction or ignorance. These, although not as such mistakes, could lead to a false belief or assumption which the law would recognise as a mistake (at [104]-[105] and [108]-[109]). It then held that the equitable jurisdiction to set aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake was exercisable when there was a causative mistake, as to either the legal character of the transaction or a matter of fact or law that was basic to the transaction, and that was of such gravity that it would be unconscionable to refuse relief (at [122]-[123] and [126]). The gravity of the mistake would be assessed objectively but by an intense focus on the facts including the circumstances of the mistake, its centrality to the transaction in question and the seriousness of its consequences (including tax consequences) for the disponor (at [126] and [128]). Thus, the Court set aside the settlement on the ground that the Mrs Pitt had made a grave mistake through her conscious belief or tacit assumption that the trust would have no adverse tax consequences since, as it turned out, the trust could have complied with the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 without artificiality or abuse of the relief which Parliament had intended to grant (at [142]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As discussed above, I have found that [Y] was unaware of the invalidity of his marriage until about 2008. However, I do not think that this mistake is material. The way the parties dealt with each other was premised less on the assumption that their marriage had been validly registered and more on the fact that, at the time, they were in a considerably close and loving relationship, which was borne out by the fact that [Y] had fought for the custody of the twins despite the fact that they were not his biological children. Had [Y] been made aware of the invalidity of his marriage at that point in time, I think that it is improbable that he would have suddenly sought to annul his marriage; on the contrary, I think it probable that he would have re-registered his marriage to establish its validity. The position <span class="font-italic">may</span> be different if [Y] had been made aware of <span class="font-italic">both </span>the invalidity of his marriage <span class="font-italic">and</span> the fact that the twins were not his biological children. However, as [Y] did not pursue the issue of the twins’ paternity (as noted above at [91]–[92]), I do not make any finding on this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For the above reasons, I allow the claims in OS240 and dismiss the claim in OS574. To recapitulate, [Y] beneficially owns the Property. It is unfortunate that the marriage between [X] and [Y] was invalid and, as such, annulled. Flowing from this are certain consequences, many of which could or did cause hardship to the parties. [X] may have made sacrifices in her relationship with [Y]. However, these are not matters of which property law is well-suited to take cognisance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Foo Tuat Yien<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Alagappan s/o Arunasalam (A Alagappan Law Corporation) for the plaintiff in HC/OS 240/2015 and the defendant in HC/OS 574/2015;<br/>Lim Pei Ling June and Low Seow Ling (Eden Law Corporation) for the defendant in HC/OS 240/2015 and the plaintiff in HC/OS 574/2015.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
