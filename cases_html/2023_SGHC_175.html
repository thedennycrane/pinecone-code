</div> The written adjudication determination (the “Adjudication Determination”) was released on 15 February 2023. The Adjudication Determination comprised separate sections, with one section assessing the jurisdictional issues raised in SOP/AA 226 of 2022, and another section dealing with the merits. Only the jurisdictional issues are relevant in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The first jurisdictional issue that the learned Adjudicator had to decide was whether the adjudication application in SOP/AA 226 of 2022 was premature. This issue turned on the time at which the PC was served by AI, which had a direct bearing on when the payment response from AGPL was due. This consequently affected the question of when AI’s entitlement to make an adjudication application under s 12(2) of the SOPA first arose.

</div> The main dispute revolved around the question of whether the PC should be regarded as having been served on 16 November 2022, which is the date on which it was actually served, or on 30 November 2022, being the last day of the month, which AGPL argued is the deemed date of service under ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The learned Adjudicator determined that the date of service of the PC was 16 November 2022. In his view, the PC was not deemed to have been served on 30 November 2022 because that date was not the “prescribed date” within the meaning of ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA.

</div> The learned Adjudicator expressed the opinion that reg 5(1) of the SOPR, which governs contracts that do not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim must be served, requires a claimant to serve the payment claim <span class="font-italic">by</span>, and not <span class="font-italic">on</span>, the last day of the month. A payment claim could therefore be served on any day in a month as reg 5(1) of the SOPR provides for a period of time for the service of a payment claim, as opposed to any specific or prescribed date.

</div> Before the SOPA was amended in 2018, there were instances where the validity of payment claims was challenged because the payment claims were served on the “wrong date” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (2 October 2018) vol 94 (Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Minister of State for National Development) (“<span class="font-italic">2018 Debate</span>”)). That led to payment delays. In the learned Adjudicator’s view, s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA has no application in any reg 5(1) situation where the contract is silent on service timelines for payment claims, as there is nothing to be saved since the payment claim may be served on any day in a month. Section 10(3) therefore does not come into play.

</div> The learned Adjudicator rejected AGPL’s argument that since the Contract provides for weekly and not monthly payment claims, this breaches the maximum frequency of one claim per month allowable under the SOPA and therefore any payment claims served would fall outside the ambit of the SOPA. In this regard, the learned Adjudicator observed that to allow contracts to fall outside the ambit of the SOPA through a contractual term providing for a frequency of claims exceeding one payment claim per month would allow parties to easily contract out of the provisions of the SOPA, which is inimical to the legislative purpose of the SOPA.

In cases where s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) applies and a payment claim is served before the Prescribed Date, s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA deems it to have been served on the Prescribed Date. After the payment claim is served on the respondent, the respondent is required to provide the claimant with a payment response. In this regard, s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA requires, in situations where the contract does not contain terms that specify, or provide for the determination of, a date by which the payment response is to be provided, the payment response to be provided within 14 days after the payment claim is “served under section 10”. If a respondent fails to provide a payment response under s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA, s 12(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA provides that the respondent may still do so during the Dispute Settlement Period, which is the period of seven days after the period within which the payment response is required to be provided under s 11(1) of the SOPA: see s 12(6) of the SOPA. If, by the end of the Dispute Settlement Period, the dispute is not settled or the respondent does not provide the payment response, the claimant is, pursuant to s 12(2) of the SOPA, entitled to make an adjudication application in relation to the payment claim. Under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, the adjudication application must be made within seven days after the entitlement to make the adjudication application first arises under s 12 of the SOPA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">AI filed the adjudication application on 13 December 2022.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Libra </span>at [32], a payment claim that is served in compliance with s 10(1) of the SOPA is the bedrock upon which the adjudication process rests, and it is the trigger for the adjudication process. As may be seen from the procedure set out at [27] above, the process is “triggered” with the service of the payment claim, and the due dates for the subsequent steps in the process hinge on the date the payment claim is “served under section 10” (see s 11(1) of the SOPA). In this case, the date on which the payment claim is “served under section 10” is therefore core to the inquiries of whether the payment response was served out of time, and whether the adjudication application was premature. If the date the PC was “served under section 10” was the actual date of service on 16 November 2022 as AI contends, the payment response provided by AGPL would have been out of time, and the adjudication application filed by AI on 13 December 2022 would have been filed in accordance with the statutory timelines and valid. If, however, the date on which the PC was “served under section 10” was deemed (under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA) to be 30 November 2022 as AGPL contends, then the payment response filed by AGPL would have been filed within time, and the adjudication application filed by AI would have been premature and invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The determination of the date of service of the PC turns on the question of what the Prescribed Date is. The answer to the latter question lies in how ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA are to be read with regs 5(1) and 5(3) of the SOPR. To begin with, ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 10(3) of the SOPA provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A payment claim must be served —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) not later than —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(i) the date, or the last day of a period, specified in, or determined in accordance with, the terms of the contract relating to the purpose of this subsection; or</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(ii) the date prescribed for the purpose of this subsection if the contract does not contain such terms; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  In subsection (2) —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a payment claim that is served before the date or last day mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is deemed to have been served on that date or day, as the case may be; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) a payment claim that is served before the prescribed date mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) is deemed to have been served on that date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Regulation 5 of the SOPR, which deals with payment claims, states at regs 5(1) and 5(3) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>—(1)  Where a contract does not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim must be served or by which such time may be determined, then a payment claim made under the contract must be served by the last day of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the month following the month in which the contract is made; or</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any subsequent month.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  In this regulation, “month” means a period of time beginning on the first day of each of the 12 calendar months into which a year is divided, and ending on the last day of each of these months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The provisions above address two different questions. First, s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, read with regs 5(1) and 5(3) of the SOPR, deals with the question of the date by which<span class="font-italic"> </span>a payment claim must be served, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the service period. Under s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), where the contract specifies, or provides for the determination of, a date or period, for the service of a payment claim, then the payment claim must be served not later than the contractual date or the last day of the contractual period. Under s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), if the contract does not contain terms that specify, or provide for the determination of, a service date or service period, then the payment claim must be served <span class="font-italic">not later than the </span><span class="font-italic">Prescribed Date</span>. It is pertinent to note that s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) defines “prescribed” as “prescribed by the Act in which the word occurs or by any subsidiary legislation made thereunder”. The relevant provisions of the subsidiary legislation are regs 5(1) and 5(3) of the SOPR. Regulation 5(1) specifies the day by which a payment claim must be served in a case where the contract does not contain any provision that specifies, or provides for the determination of, the time at which a payment claim must be served. So, where s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) applies, reg 5(1) of the SOPR also applies to provide that a payment claim must be served <span class="font-italic">by </span>the last day of the month following the month in which the contract is made or any subsequent month. In this regard, reg 5(3) clarifies that “month” means a calendar month. Reading these provisions together, it follows that the Prescribed Date contemplated in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) must be the last day of the relevant calendar month. Put simply, where s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) applies, the payment claim must be served not later than the last day of the relevant calendar month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, s 10(3) of the SOPA deals with the separate question of when a payment claim is <span class="font-italic">deemed to have been served</span> for the purposes of the running of the statutory timelines, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the service date. In other words, the <span class="font-italic">actual date</span> of service of the payment claim, and the <span class="font-italic">deemed </span><span class="font-italic">date </span>of service<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the payment claim, may differ. Under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), where the contract specifies, or provides for the determination of, a date or period for the service of a payment claim, a payment claim that is served before the contractual date or the last day of the contractual period is deemed to have been served on that contractual date or on that last day of that contractual period, as the case may be. Under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), if the contract does not contain terms that specify, or provide for the determination of, a date or period for the service of a payment claim, then a payment claim that is served before the Prescribed Date is deemed to have been served on the Prescribed Date<span class="font-italic">.</span> This deemed service date is important because it determines the subsequent timelines for the provision of a payment response and the filing of an adjudication application (if any). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 From the above, it is clear that both ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) apply to scenarios where the contract does not contain terms that specify, or provide for the determination of, a contractual service date or contractual service period. Specifically, s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) provides for a service period and s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides for a deemed service date. What, then, is the cumulative effect of these two provisions when applied together? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In answering this question, AI submits that, where ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) apply, there is a prescribed service period but there is no Prescribed Date on which a payment claim must be deemed to have been served, relying heavily on the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li </span><span class="font-italic">Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span>”).

</div> AI argues that since <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> held at [93]–[94] that reg 5(1) of the SOPR provides that a payment claim shall be served “by the last day of each month following the month in which the contract is made”, and that “it would not matter on what day [of the month] the claim is made”, this means that a payment claim may be served on any day in a month. There is, therefore, no “prescribed date” as such, and no requirement to serve a payment claim at the end of the month.

</div>
</div> AI further argues that it is not stated in reg 5(1) of the SOPR that the last day of the month is the Prescribed Date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I am unable to agree with that submission. In my view, the fact that reg 5(1) allows for a period in which a payment claim must be actually served does not detract from its separate effect of also <span class="font-italic">deeming </span>a service date for the purpose of s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). It bears emphasis that the Prescribed Date in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), read with reg 5(1), is the <span class="font-italic">same</span> “prescribed date” referred to in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). This is because s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) refers to the “prescribed date mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii)” of s 10. This means that the Prescribed Date in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), that sets out the last day on which a payment claim may be served, is also the deemed date of service under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). In light of my finding in [31] that the Prescribed Date is the last day of the relevant calendar month, the deemed date of service under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is therefore also the last day in the relevant calendar month. Accordingly, the effect of ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is that if the contract does not contain terms that specify, or provide for the determination of, a service date or service period, then any payment claim will be deemed to have been served on the last day of the calendar month in which it was served, regardless of when it was actually served.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There is a further reason why I do not accept AI’s argument. It disregards the fact that the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 47 of 2018) (“SOPA Amendment Act”) amended s 10 of the SOPA by <span class="font-italic">introducing</span> the deeming provision in s 10(3) of the SOPA via s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA Amendment Act. Indeed, the Explanatory Statement to the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 38/2018) (“SOPA Amendment Bill”) (pursuant to which the SOPA Amendment Act was enacted) explains that the new s 10(3) was inserted “to specify the deemed date of service for a payment claim that is served before the applicable due date in section 10(2)”. Further, when Parliament enacted s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA, it decided, for the purpose of defining the Prescribed Date, to adopt the same date as that mentioned in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). Accordingly, AI’s argument that there is no Prescribed Date is flawed as it turns a blind eye to the deeming provision in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA and the scheme adopted by Parliament for determining the statutory timelines under the SOPA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is apposite at this juncture to deal with a point made by the learned Adjudicator, that the words “or <span class="font-italic">last day</span> mentioned in subsection 2(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) …” [emphasis added] which are present in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, are absent in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA. In the learned Adjudicator’s view, this point supports the position that the Prescribed Date mentioned in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA cannot possibly be the last day of the month, which is AGPL’s interpretation of the statute.

</div>
</div>
</div> I am unable to agree with the learned Adjudicator. In my judgment, there is no reference to the “last day” in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA simply because s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) makes no reference to the last day of a period. As s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) refers only to the Prescribed Date, s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) likewise makes reference to a <span class="font-italic">single date</span>. This <span class="font-italic">single date </span>is the Prescribed Date, which, as explained at [31] and [35] above, is the last day of the month. In contrast, s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) refers to “the date or last day mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)” as s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) refers to both a “date” and also “a period”. The reference to “last day” in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA is necessary to accommodate the reference in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) to “a period”, which, logically, has a “last day”. Therefore, the fact that the words “last day” appear in s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) but are absent from s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) says nothing about whether the Prescribed Date can or cannot be the last day of the month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 AI’s alternative submission is that <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span>’s holding supports its view that “any day” can be the Prescribed Date.

First, <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> was not concerned with the interpretation of the SOPA or SOPR to ascertain the date of the service of the payment claim, as is the case here. Second, AI’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> is problematic in that it attempts to apply an authority that was decided before the SOPA was amended in 2018.

It will result in s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) providing that “[a] payment claim must be served … not later than … [any day]”. As for s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), I will use the present Contract for illustration.

The difference between the two provisions is that s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA applies to contracts where the service date or service period for payment claims is specified in the contract or can be determined in accordance with contractual terms, whereas s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA applies to contracts where the service date or service period is not specified and cannot be so determined using the contractual terms. Based on the Minister’s explanation, under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, if a payment claim is served before the date stipulated in the contract for service of a payment claim, the payment claim will still be valid, but the respondent’s deadline for the payment response will only start running from the date stipulated in the contract for service of payment claims or from the last day of the service period (in the event the contract stipulates a period for service). However, I note that both ss 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are worded similarly, and there is no reason why the Minister’s comments on the effect of s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA should not also apply in parallel to s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), such that the respondent’s deadline for payment response will only start running from the Prescribed Date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Next, as against AGPL’s proposed reading of s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Prescribed Date refers to the “last date of the month”, AI submits that AGPL’s interpretation would retard rather than speed up the payment process.

</div> This argument does not advance AI's case. In the context of a contract like the present one, wherein the parties do not stipulate timelines for the service of payment claims or payment responses, it is reasonable for the respondent's deadline for payment response to be fixed to run only from the last day of the calendar month. This provides certainty for the respondent and helps to facilitate the timely service of payment responses. A payment process that keeps to regular timelines that run from a consistent day in each month keeps the SOPA mechanism running smoothly, prevents the missing of deadlines due to inadvertence, and minimises disputes. As a corollary, this also relieves a respondent from the need to constantly keep track of payment claims that are not served according to any stipulated contractual timelines. Indeed, the practical value of having a consistent and fixed date for the calculation of payment claim and payment response timelines was observed by the Minister at the Second Reading of the SOPA Amendment Bill when he stated that “[t]ypically, a contract will stipulate a specific date or fixed period for payment claims to be served so that employers can better manage payment claims from multiple sub-contractors” (see <span class="font-italic">2018 Debate</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Finally, AI makes the broad argument that the deeming provision in s 10(3) of the SOPA does not operate in situations such as the present, where reg 5(1) of the SOPR allows a payment claim to be served on any day of the month.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I am, however, not able to agree with this line of argument. As observed above at [32], s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is the deeming provision that applies where the contract does <span class="font-italic">not</span> contain terms that stipulate, or provide for the determination of, a date or period for the service of a payment claim. The issue of payment claims being prematurely served before the contractually stipulated date or service period therefore does not arise in such situations. Yet, in such situations, Parliament saw it fit to introduce s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as a deeming provision that would apply to payment claims. It is therefore patently obvious that s 10(3) of the SOPA applies even when payment claims do not require saving. In my view, s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides certainty for the timelines for the filing of payment responses and adjudication applications, and it achieves this by altering, for the purposes of s 11(1) of the SOPA, the date on which a payment claim is regarded as “served under section 10” from the actual date of service to the deemed date of service. It is therefore not open to AI to argue that s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) should not be given effect at all on the basis that the payment claims in such situations do not need saving.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In view of the foregoing, I find that the Prescribed Date for the purposes of ss 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA is “the last day of the month”, with “month” referring to a calendar month.

I begin with the question of the date on which the PC was served under s 10 of the SOPA. In this regard, since the PC was actually served on 16 November 2022 and the Contract does not stipulate the date for service, the PC is <span class="font-italic">deemed</span> to have been served on 30 November 2022, being the last day of November 2022. Turning then to ascertain the date by which the payment response must have been provided, given that the Contract does not prescribe a timeline for the provision of the payment response, s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA states that the payment response must be provided by AGPL “within 14 days after the payment claim is served under section 10”. Therefore, the payment response should have been provided by 14 December 2022, which was 14 days after the deemed date of service of the PC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I now consider the date on which AI was entitled to make an adjudication application. Taking into account the Dispute Settlement Period as provided for by ss 12(2) read with 12(6), which is a period of seven days after the date by which the payment response is required to be provided (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 14 December 2022), I find that AI’s entitlement to make an adjudication application first arose after 21 December 2022, on 22 December 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 After this entitlement first arose on 22 December 2022, s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that AI was entitled to make the adjudication application within seven days thereafter. Accordingly, the earliest date for the making of a valid adjudication application in respect of the PC was 22 December 2022. The present adjudication application in SOP/AA 226 of 2022, which was lodged on 13 December 2022, was therefore lodged prematurely. As the right to make an adjudication application had not arisen at the time it was filed, the adjudication application is invalid, and the learned Adjudicator had no power to adjudicate. Thus, the learned Adjudicator was without jurisdiction to render a determination in SOP/AA 226 of 2022 and the Adjudication Determination should be set aside. This is sufficient to dispose of this application brought by AGPL, but I will deal briefly with the other two issues raised by AGPL for completeness.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The provision for “weekly progress claims” </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I turn now to consider AGPL’s contention that no payment claims for work done under the Contract may be made under the SOPA,

Where reg 5(1) applies, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the contract does not contain any provision that specifies, or provides for the determination of, the time at which a payment claim must be served, reg 5(1A) is meant to regulate <span class="font-italic">the frequency of service of payment claims</span>. There is nothing in reg 5(1A) which limits the application of the SOPA or which excludes contracts from the ambit of the SOPA.

I agree with the learned Adjudicator that the provision for weekly progress claims in the Contract does not disentitle AI from serving payment claims under the SOPA. To conclude otherwise would also defeat the protective regime of the SOPA because the SOPA may be disapplied, whether intentionally or inadvertently, by employers and contractors simply through seemingly innocuous contractual terms varying the payment frequency in contracts that do not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim must be served. Indeed, s 36(1) of the SOPA prevents this by providing that “[t]he provisions of [the SOPA] have effect despite any provision to the contrary in any contract or agreement”. I therefore reject AGPL’s contention that the term providing for “weekly progress claims” takes the Contract outside the ambit of the SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 There is no need for me to go further and deal with the arguments on whether the “weekly progress claims” term is a contractual term that purports to modify the operation of reg 5(1A) of the SOPA and which is therefore “nullified” by s 36 of the SOPA, or whether the Contract may be supplemented by the provisions in the SOPA notwithstanding any gaps created by the nullification of the “weekly progress claims” term. AI advances these arguments in response to AGPL’s contention that the SOPA has no application to the Contract. However, there is nothing that disentitles AI from serving the PC on AGPL as I have found at [52] and [54] that the SOPA applies to the Contract. In this regard, it is clear that AI’s entitlement to progress payment, as provided for by the Contract, is consistent with s 5 of the SOPA which states that any “person who has carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or services, under a contract is entitled to a progress payment”. Pertinently, AI is not acting in contravention of reg 5(1A) of the SOPR when it combined its payment entitlements for work done under the Contract within a reference period that stretched from 19 July to 31 October 2022 when it submitted the PC for a “FINAL CLAIMED AMOUNT” on 16 November 2022.

</div> In short, there is no issue of the “weekly progress claims” term being engaged in any way to thwart the operation of the SOPA or any part of the SOPA, or to contravene reg 5(1A).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Similarly, to the extent that AGPL’s complaint about the Contract is that “the claims were based on instalment [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and not valuation”,

</div>
</div> I have not been referred to any legislative or case authority in support of AGPL’s contention that the claims, which AGPL refers to as instalments, put the Contract outside the ambit of the SOPA. On the contrary, s 2 of the SOPA provides that a “progress payment” means a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a contract, and includes a single or one-off payment (including a final payment) or a payment that is based on an event or a date (including a final payment). There is nothing in that provision that excludes a progress payment that is based on a pre-determined quantification that the contracting parties had agreed to or an aggregation of such quantifications. In fact, s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA provides that the amount of a progress payment is the amount calculated in accordance with the contract. It is only if the contract does not contain such a provision that s 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA applies to provide that the amount of a progress payment is to be calculated on the basis of the value of the construction work carried out or of the goods or services supplied. In short, the parties in this case had agreed to progress payments to be paid under the Contract on a regular interval for pre-determined amounts, and there is nothing in the SOPA or the SOPR which precludes such an arrangement. In my view, therefore, AGPL’s argument that the Contract is outside the ambit of the SOPA because it provides for instalment (as opposed to valuated) payments also cannot stand and should not be accepted.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">AI’s alleged refusal to provide a performance bond</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, I turn to AGPL’s contention that the SOPA is not intended to allow claims by contractors who do not meet basic contractual requirements to the prejudice of employers. In this regard, AGPL complains about AI’s alleged refusal to provide a performance bond as required by cl 9 of the Contract and argues that the alleged failure of the learned Adjudicator to account for the performance bond sum created errors in the adjudicated amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This argument by AGPL may be promptly disposed of. It is not stated anywhere in the SOPA that a contractor’s entitlement to a progress payment is contingent on the provision of a performance bond, even if there is a contractual stipulation for the provision of such a bond. Further, any issue with the adjudicated amount determined by the learned Adjudicator, including any alleged failure to account for the performance bond amount that AGPL contends AI is contractually bound to furnish, would go to the merits of the learned Adjudicator’s evaluation of AI’s claim, and is not a ground to set aside the Adjudication Determination in SOP/AA 226 of 2022. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Man</span><span class="font-italic">agement Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 979 at [73], the role of a court in reviewing an adjudicator’s determination is not to review the merits of the determination, and any setting aside must be premised on the adjudicator’s acting in excess of his jurisdiction or in breach of the rules of natural justice. This principle applies to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Concluding remarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given my finding at [48] that the Adjudication Application was lodged prematurely and that the learned Adjudicator was without jurisdiction to render a determination in SOP/AA 226 of 2022, I allow AGPL’s application and set aside the Adjudication Determination pursuant to s 27(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. I also make the usual consequential orders for payment out of the security furnished by AGPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I will hear the parties on costs. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Teh Hwee Hwee<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Wei Yung and Harpal Singh (Tito Isaac &amp; Co LLP) for the claimant</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chia Swee Chye Kelvin (Lumen Law Corporation) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
