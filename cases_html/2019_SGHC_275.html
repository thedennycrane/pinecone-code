In the Suit, Alphire’s claims were broken down into five categories, namely Categories A, B, C, D, and E. While the applicant admitted collecting the sums in Categories A and B, he denied ever collecting the sums in Categories D and E. As for Category C, it overlapped with Category B, and the two categories were thus analysed together: <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group Pte Ltd v Law Chau Loon </span>[2017] SGHC 297 (the “Judgment”) at [8]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In his Judgment, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J held that the applicant was liable to Alphire for the Category A and B sums (the Judgment at [26] and [31]). However, as Alphire failed to make any submissions or tender any objective evidence to establish that the applicant had indeed collected the sums in Categories D and E (which he denied ever collecting), the learned judge held that the applicant was not liable for the sums claimed under Categories D and E (the Judgment at [32]–[33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As a result, the applicant was liable to pay the sums in Categories A (S$2,821,788.52) and B (S$3,083,429.22) to Alphire. To be deducted against these sums were payments that had been paid by the applicant to Alphire, which amounted to S$2,379,169.03. Hence, Alphire was entitled to S$3,526,048.71 and interest thereon (“the Judgment sum”) (the Judgment at [34]–[36]). However, Alphire’s claims under Categories D and E, which totalled S$1,298,478.77 (the Judgment at [9(c)]–[9(d)]),

</div> Furthermore, apart from Alicia’s affidavit, which did not directly contradict the various assertions made by the applicant, no other affidavits were tendered on Alphire’s behalf, be it by the Investors or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 To add credence to the applicant’s account of the Investors’ involvement, it was noteworthy that the applicant had made his assertions in his 2015 AEIC, long before the issue of the Investors’ authority surfaced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The evidence thus showed that the directors of Alphire were in fact subservient to the Investors, who were directly involved in the management and operation of Alphire, and who were the ones whom the directors of Alphire answered and/or reported on issues relating to the management, operations, and profitability of Alphire. Given their significant involvement in the financial affairs of the company, it was unsurprising that the Investors would be vested with the implied actual authority to enter into a settlement agreement in relation to the outstanding Judgment sum that was owed to Alphire, and in which they, as Investors, would have a direct interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my judgment, the correspondence between the parties’ solicitors was illuminating. On 8 February 2019, the applicant’s solicitors sent an email, which was marked “Without Prejudice” and “Subject to Contract”, to Alphire’s solicitors, alleging that “[o]ur respective clients have reached an in-principle full and final settlement of the judgment debt in respect of” the Suit.

</div> Such a belated shift in position, after the parties had consistently been in consensus that a final settlement had been entered into at the 2 February 2019 meeting, suggested that the issue relating to the purported lack of authority was but a tactical decision to enable Alphire to distance itself from the settlement agreement. This was after it was unable to gain the applicant’s approval of the terms of the said agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the circumstances, I found that the Investors were vested with the implied actual authority to enter into the settlement agreement on Alphire’s behalf.

The respondents averred that the letters read as a whole constituted a binding agreement in full and final settlement. However, the bank denied that this was a valid compromise. Considering the chain of correspondence, the  Federal Court concluded that there was a valid compromise in the circumstances, on the basis of <span class="font-italic">two </span>letters which suggested that the bank would accept shares owned by the respondents as a <span class="font-italic">full and final settlement </span>of the sum owed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The context in which parties allegedly arrived at a full and final settlement is thus of utmost importance.

</div> As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the courts look at the <span class="font-italic">whole </span>course of the negotiations between both parties in order to ascertain if an agreement is reached <span class="font-italic">at any given point in time</span>. It should further be noted that where such a point is identified, the mere fact that negotiations are continued <span class="font-italic">thereafter </span>does not of itself affect the existence of the agreement <span class="font-italic">already concluded</span>. Of course, if the continued negotiations disclose <span class="font-italic">an agreed rescission </span>of an agreement already concluded, then the position is quite different. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This was precisely the case in <span class="font-italic">Bumi Armada</span>. In that case, the parties held a meeting on 31 July 2014 (“the 31 July Meeting”). The minutes for the meeting were subsequently prepared on 1 August 2014 (“the 1 August MOM”), and the 1 August MOM included a “subject to contract” stipulation. That being the case, the court held that the 1 August MOM could not create a legally binding obligation (<span class="font-italic">Bumi Armada </span>at [23]). However, the testimony given at trial revealed that there had in fact been an unqualified oral agreement concluded at a 31 July Meeting. Hence, the court concluded that “there was a binding oral agreement as to the right of first refusal on 31 July 2014 notwithstanding the 1 August MOM.” Taking such a view, the 1 August MOM was effectively irrelevant, and there was no need to consider the effect of the “subject to contract” clause (<span class="font-italic">Bumi Armada </span>at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the present case, the parties had entered into a binding settlement agreement on the Original terms and as evidenced by the WhatsApp Message. It may have been that the “Subject to Contract” had been slipped in unintentionally, or that the applicant’s solicitors did not appreciate the significance of introducing such a clause in the header of their 8 February 2019 email. However, the effect of the 8 February 2019 email, and the subsequent correspondence between the parties in which they quarrelled over the precise terms of the settlement agreement, were strictly speaking irrelevant, as the applicant had never agreed to a variation of the Original terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In fact, the applicant’s solicitors stressed that Alphire had sought to introduce additional terms in its 15 February 2019 letter, which were terms the applicant did not agree to.

</div> The 8 February 2019 letter therefore did not detract from the finding that a settlement agreement had been entered into on 2 February 2019; it was simply an accurate reflection of the state of the applicant’s solicitors’ knowledge (or lack thereof) at the time the letter was sent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Next, Alphire referred to the applicant’s solicitors’ email dated 6 March 2019. In that email, the applicant’s solicitors requested a two week adjournment of an examination of judgment debtor hearing to allow “parties to finalise the terms of the in-principle settlement”. This allegedly constituted further proof that the terms of the settlement had not been finally settled on 2 February 2019.

</div> In my view, the 6 March 2019 email should be read in its proper context. The email was the applicant’s solicitors’ reply to emails sent by Alphire’s solicitors on 15 and 18 February 2019, in which the latter had proposed that the terms of the settlement agreement constituted terms that exceeded the Original terms.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-ceb2c8ce-48aa-4014-83d5-9b90675c8335" data-toggle="modal" type="button">63</button></sup>

</div> Given the conflict between the parties as to the actual terms of the settlement agreement, the 6 March 2019 was thus an indication that more time was required to determine the actual terms of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, on 12 March 2019, the applicant’s solicitors sent a letter to Alphire’s solicitors, in which they confirmed that only the Original terms had been agreed to on 2 February 2019.
