The facts of that case are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 15 November 2010, the plaintiff, Mr Thomas Teddy, was travelling as a passenger in a taxi when a lorry belonging to the defendant collided into the rear of the taxi. The plaintiff claimed that he did not feel any pain immediately after the accident although he was jerked forward and then flung backwards. Later that evening, he experienced loss of sensation in both his hands and arms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The plaintiff had suffered a stroke about 11 months earlier on 10 October 2009. He managed to recover from the stroke by December 2009. However, as of March 2010, he began experiencing pain in the neck, weakness in both hands and progressive gait instability. He consulted a neurologist, Dr Tang Kok Foo on 11 May 2010. Dr Tang ordered an MRI of the plaintiff’s spine. It revealed that the plaintiff had disc degeneration at three levels (C3/C4, C4/C5 and C5/C6) with very severe cord compression at the lower two levels. Essentially, he diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from cervical myelopathy and diabetic neuropathy and recommended surgery to stop the cervical myelopathy from getting worse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The plaintiff consulted a neurosurgeon, Dr PK Pillay for a second opinion on 7 July 2010. Dr Pillay also ordered an MRI and on the basis of the MRI findings, he diagnosed the plaintiff with cervical myelo-radiculopathy and also recommended surgery. On 14 July 2010, Dr Pillay performed an “anterior cervical microdisectomy and fusion for C4/5 and C5/6 significant disc protrusions that were causing the myelo-radiculopathy” (“the first surgery”). According to the plaintiff he felt a dramatic improvement in his condition after the first surgery. He claimed to have completely recovered from the first surgery by October 2010, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> one month before the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The day after the accident, the plaintiff went to see Dr Pillay because he was concerned that the accident might have had an impact on his spine. An MRI of his cervical spine was done on the same day. In the MRI report, the radiologist stated the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There are fractures of the C4 to C6 vertebral bodies with post-operative changes present.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Posterior central/paracentral disc protrusions at C3/4 to C7/T1 are seen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff claimed that he could not feel his hands and that “everything was numb”. Dr Pillay carried out urgent surgery on 26 November 2010. According to the plaintiff, there was little improvement after the surgery. Dr Pillay’s report dated 18 March 2011, a few months after the second surgery, estimated that the plaintiff had “a 70% permanent disability”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 At the assessment of damages before an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”), one of the “most hotly contested issues” was whether the plaintiff’s injuries and disabilities were caused by the accident or by pre-existing conditions. The AR found that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff were caused by the accident and awarded, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, $60,000 for pain and suffering.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendant’s appeal was heard by Prakash J (as she then was). The learned judge accepted the defendant’s submissions that the defendant “should not have to compensate the plaintiff for any pain or disabilities he would have suffered regardless of the accident” (at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 To decide whether that was indeed the case, she asked three questions pertinent to the facts of the case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What was the effectiveness of the first surgery in relieving the pain that the plaintiff experienced prior to that surgery?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) What was the effectiveness of the first surgery in preventing the plaintiff’s cervical spine from degenerating further?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) What was the effect of the accident on the cervical spine?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In answer to the first question, the learned judge accepted that the plaintiff experienced dramatic improvement after the first surgery. She also found on the balance of probabilities that the first surgery was effective in arresting deterioration of the plaintiff’s spine (at [28], [34]). With regard to the third question she found that the fractures were more likely than not caused by the accident (at [36]). Accordingly, the defendant’s appeal against the award of damages for pain and suffering was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Adopting a similar line of inquiry as that adopted by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Teddy Thomas</span>, the relevant questions are:</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the nucleoplasty and bilateral nerve root blocks were effective in relieving the pain in the lumbar spine</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Plaintiff reported four pain free days before the accident occurred.

It is also not clear what her pre-existing condition was before the accident apart from the statement that the x-ray showed “evidence of cervical spondylosis” (at [4]). In contrast, the Plaintiff in the present case was suffering multiple-level degeneration of the cervical spine (C3-4, C4-5, C5-6 and C6-7).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Defendants submitted that the Plaintiff’s neck issue was far less severe compared to her back issues.

The key question is, of course, whether the person was indeed traumatised. To answer that question, one should not be obliged to accept that if the claimant maintained that she perceived her life to be in danger, she was necessarily telling the truth. If that were the case, no claimant would ever fail in the claim. For this reason, it is necessary to consider the nature of the event to determine how likely it was that such an event would traumatise the claimant. Since it is impossible to read the mind of the claimant the way one reads a book or a scan, one inevitably has to fall back on common human experience; in other words, the objective test. That is not to say that there could never be a successful claim based purely on the claimant’s subjective perception of a threat being of a life-threatening nature despite objective evidence that the threat did not qualify as such. But it would have to be exceptional, with the court believing the claimant’s perception to be true. Suffice it to say that such is not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The accident was obviously minor. Damage to the vehicle was minimal.

Renovation costs (as distinct from repair costs) are similarly capital in nature. As such these items should not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> go to increase the losses in the Plaintiff’s business except to the extent annual depreciation allowances are permitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Second, the Plaintiff had applied for government subsidies under the PIC scheme in 2014. It is not clear whether she did obtain the subsidies but, if she did, it would reduce her capital outlay for the purchase of equipment. Thus, even if it were appropriate to treat the capital expenditure as wholly allowable against the income (which in my view it is not), due adjustments ought to have been made because of the grants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 For the foregoing reasons, it is clear that the Plaintiff substantially inflated her losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 To some extent, it would appear that the Plaintiff’s computation of loss has been moderated by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Thus the loss of $60,348 in Boon Auto’s Statement of Accounts for 2015 has been reflected as $44,605 (derived from subtracting from the cumulative loss of $91,436 in Year of Assessment 2015, the cumulative loss of $46,831 for the previous Year of Assessment). I assume the Revenue would have picked up any inappropriate claim for capital allowances and failure to take into account the PIC grants (if any).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The loss of $66,736 for Year of Assessment 2016 reflected in the  Statement of Accounts of Boon Auto has similarly been reduced to $57,651 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $149,087 less $91,436). Similarly, any deduction for employer’s CPF contribution beyond the mandated percentage would presumably have been picked up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 That leaves us with the inflated salary figures. It seems unlikely that those figures would have been challenged by the Revenue, unlike the obvious excessive claims for CPF contributions and deduction of capital expenditure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It is necessary therefore to adjust losses claimed to have been suffered by the Plaintiff by reducing the salary figures and corresponding CPF contributions based on those salary figures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In the absence of the ages of the employees, it is not possible to calculate the appropriate CPF contributions. But whatever figures are eventually arrived at, the discrepancy between those figures and the CPF contributions reflected in the Statement of Accounts ought to be deducted in determining the Plaintiff’s losses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Failure to mitigate losses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The Defendants submitted that the Plaintiff failed to mitigate her losses in that she should have sold off her business or ceased operations as soon as possible so as not to incur more loss.

</div> Although Ms Heidi Tan appeared to have accepted the Plaintiff’s own evaluation, the question as to the extent of debilitating pain the Plaintiff actually experiences are not beyond doubt. It will be recalled that both Dr WC Chang and Dr Hee were of the view that the pain was more likely to be psychological.

</div> If this is correct, it will probably be even easier for the Plaintiff to resume involvement in the business. As to whether there are job opportunities outside the family business available for one with her profile, there is no evidence either way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For an award for loss of future earnings to be made, there has to be credible evidence in support; the court cannot act on speculation or conjecture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Teo Sing Keng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Sim Ban Kiat</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 340 at [38] cited with approval the following dictum of Syed Agil Barakbah FJ in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Long v Dr S Underwood</span> [1983] 2 MLJ 324:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Now, the general principle is that an injured plaintiff is entitled to damages for the loss of earnings and profits which he has suffered by reason of his injuries up to the date of the trial and for the loss of the prospective earnings and profits of which he is likely to be deprived in the future. There must be evidence on which the court can find that the plaintiff will suffer future loss of earnings, it cannot act on mere speculation. If there is no satisfactory evidence of future loss of earnings but the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered a loss of earning capacity, it will award him damages for his loss of capacity as part of the general damages for disability and not as compensation for future loss of earnings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As the learned editors of <span class="font-italic">Practitioners’ Library</span><span class="font-italic"> – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">the Practitioner</span><span class="font-italic">s’ Library</span>”) pithily put it at para 4-3: “An award for loss of future earnings can only be made if there is real assessable loss provable by evidence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 One key difficulty in this case is in arriving at a multiplier. The Plaintiff’s present limited capacity for work is largely because of her complaints of pain. The evidence of the orthopaedic surgeons on both sides is that after the fusion surgery the pain should have resolved (barring a “failed back syndrome” as to the existence of which, I note, there is no evidence). They therefore suggested that the pain was more psychological in nature. Dr Lim, the psychiatrist, referred to a link between pain and depression. If follows that if her depression is resolved, the pain should likewise resolve or, at the least, subside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 As was earlier noted, Dr Lee Ee Lian opined that she would be required to treat the Plaintiff for depression for a period of 18 to 24 months. Dr Lim was of the view that if the Plaintiff was stable for two years on medication, it would be a good time to stop medication. Therefore, it is possible that in about two years’ time, she may be capable of undertaking work akin to what she was doing before the accident. Admittedly, there can be no certainty. Hence the difficulty with the multiplier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It is also difficult to arrive at a multiplicand because her capacity for work is dependent on how well she recovers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In short, it is impossible to undertake a computation of loss of future earnings without involving conjecture or speculation. The award should therefore be for loss of earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 When assessing loss of earning capacity, the court will have to take into account “all sorts of factors… varying almost infinitely with the facts of particular cases”: per Browne LJ in<span class="font-italic"> Moeliker v A Reyrolle &amp; Co Ltd </span>[1977] 1 WLR 132 at 141. Ultimately, the court arrives at a figure ‘in the round’ which in its view would do justice to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Defendants’ counsel submit that the appropriate award for loss of earning capacity ought to be $70,000 taking into account the Plaintiff’s profile, qualifications and trade experience.

She suffered injury of the cervical spine (with prospect of osteoarthritis and shoulder injury) as a result of an accident with a bus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 At the time of the accident, she was earning $4,300 per month ($51,600 per annum) both as an editor as well as a part-time lecturer. After the accident, she was obliged by reason of her injury to cease working as an editor, retaining her role as part-time lecturer and additionally taking up a role as a practicum supervisor which was physically less strenuous. Her monthly income dropped to $2,500 ($30,000 per annum). She was originally awarded loss of future earnings of $198,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $1,500 per month for 11 years) but on the defendant’s appeal, that was replaced by an award for loss of earning capacity of $70,000 (at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In accepting the defendant’s arguments in favour of an award for loss of earning capacity instead of loss of future earnings, the court held that while the accident adversely affected the claimant’s earning ability and made it difficult for her to maintain an editing career, it did not affect her main skills or her ability to exploit them profitably. Further, as a well-qualified professional, the claimant could command reasonably good remuneration whether she worked on a full-time or part-time basis (at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Relying on this reasoning, the Defendants draw a parallel in the present case.

His condition would continue to deteriorate without surgical intervention. Taking into account the plaintiff’s income of $420,000 per annum for the years immediately preceding and after the accident and a post-trial working period of 15 years till the age of 65, the High Court awarded the plaintiff $180,000 for loss of earning capacity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong </span>(supra), the plaintiff, a lawyer, suffered a whiplash injury with permanent disabilities. One factor which the High Court considered was the length of the plaintiff’s remaining working life since ‘the impairments, risk and various imponderables would have to be assessed over a longer period for a younger person’ (at [34]). At age 47, the plaintiff had the same post-trial working span of 15 years as the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Nirumalan </span><span class="font-italic">V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan</span> (supra).

The plaintiff was 46 years old at the time of the accident. The plaintiff found employment as a psychiatric nurse in Australia after the accident although he had contended, without success, that the injuries had prevented him from returning to the United States, where he would have enjoyed a higher salary if he was employed as a registered nurse. Given that the plaintiff’s condition might improve further, Judith Prakash J noted the difficulty in quantifying how the plaintiff’s disabilities would affect his earning capacity in the long term. In the 2 years prior to the assessment hearing, the plaintiff’s post-accident income was about A$35,000. This was much lower than the income of the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Nirumalan </span><span class="font-italic">V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan</span> (supra) and <span class="font-italic">Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong</span> (supra). Other relevant considerations included the exigencies of life and accelerated receipt of the lump sum. The court held that an award of S$35,000 for loss of earning capacity was not unreasonable. This was roughly equivalent to 80% of one year’s income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 At the time of the assessment of damages, the Plaintiff was 50 years old. Her average annual income before the accident was $57,643. As a result of the minor accident, she suffered aggravation of her existing cervical spondylosis (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, degeneration of the cervical spine) for which there was no mention of any treatment. She also suffered aggravation of the pre-existing degeneration of her lumbar spine. The degree of aggravation is between the 15–20% (estimated by Dr WC Chang) and 50% (estimated by Dr Hee).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Her disability was largely because of the pain which she complained of. However, as earlier stated it is possible that the pain issue could be resolved within about two years, that being the estimated period for continuation of psychiatric treatment for her depression.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In the assessment of damages for loss of earning capacity, the Plaintiff’s pre-existing health condition needs to be taken into account. In other words, her loss of income earning capacity owing to her pre-existing condition does not qualify for compensation. Even if I allowed that the Plaintiff’s condition after the accident was 50% aggravated by the collision, the $70,000 proposed by the Defendants implies a quantum of $140,000 before the discount.

This decision has withstood time and is solidly endorsed at House of Lords level by <span class="font-italic">Parry v Cleaver</span> [[1970] A.C. 1], not only by the majority who relied upon it by analogy but also by the minority who sought to distinguish it, and more recently by Lord Bridge speaking for the whole House in <span class="font-italic">Hussain v New Taplow Paper Mills</span> [[1988] A.C. 514 at 527G] and in <span class="font-italic">Hodgson v Trapp</span> [[1989] A.C. 807 at 819H], and by Lord Templeman similarly in <span class="font-italic">Smoker v London Fire Authority</span> [[1991] 2 A.C. 502 at 539B–F].

</div> Objections similar to those in relation to Dr Eric Hong’s charges were raised in regard to Dr Tan’s charges. Dr Tan reportedly had declined the Plaintiff’s request to testify at the trial. The Defendants therefore submitted that there was no explanation as to the need for and relevance of his treatment in relation to the Plaintiff’s accident related injury.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Dr Hee had referred the Plaintiff to Dr Tan as a result of the Plaintiff’s persistent complaints of pain. As earlier recounted, both Dr Hee and Dr WC Chang had opined that after the fusion surgery when the painful vertebral segment was stabilised to stop movement, the pain should have subsided or stopped. Dr Hee qualified his opinion to allow for the possibility of a “failed back syndrome” in some cases but did not go so far as to say that that was the case with the Plaintiff. Both orthopaedic surgeons thought that the pain might in large part be psychological. Dr Hee’s words were “There is also a significant psychological component, which psychiatrists would be more qualified to address”. Dr WC Chang said “The Plaintiff’s chronic pain is not so much organic in nature. It is more psychological in nature”.

However, the Defendants’ objections are premised upon trite law that the Plaintiff is only entitled to recover in special damages that which he has specifically pleaded and is able to prove. There was no specialist report. Dr KE Lee was not called as a witness to testify that the medical expenses were reasonably incurred in relation to injuries she sustained from the accident. The Defendants had no opportunity to test any evidence he might have given in relation thereto.

</div> What the Functional Assessment Report actually said was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The client reported that following the accident, there has been a drastic change in her daily lifestyle. In the first year after the accident, her husband drove the client to the office everyday as she needed supervision and they had yet to employ the maid. Subsequently, she returned to the office on at a hoc basis [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to interact with customers. She reported she did not resume the job tasks which require physical and cognitive demands and the tasks were outsourced. They had sold off the workshop earlier this year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 In my view, the Defendants’ contention is an unwarranted inference from the paragraph quoted. It seems to me quite clear that the “supervision” therein referred to was not in regard to work at the office that she allegedly continued to perform but rather to the assistance that she needed in her physical activities of daily living.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The Defendants also suggest that the fact that the first FDW was employed one year after the accident meant that they (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the family) were coping fine without a maid for one year and that other family members probably did their share of domestic duties as they had always done.

If so, the 2nd and 3rd maids would have in part been doing the work which the other family members would otherwise have done. It follows that only part of their salaries and expenses were claimable. This was mere conjecture on the Defendants’ part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The Defendants also refer to a video recording taken by a private investigator surveilling the Plaintiff.

Although the Plaintiff was not incapable of performing less demanding household tasks, she was incapable of undertaking tasks which required her to be on her feet for long and especially when she was in pain.
