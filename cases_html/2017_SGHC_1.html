The dispute can be traced to a joint venture between two shareholders which went really badly, almost from the word “go”. This case is a derivative action brought by one shareholder of the company against a director – the other shareholder – alleging that he breached his fiduciary duties to the company by procuring an “assignment” of a charterparty to a company he substantially owned, on terms enabling him to make a profit. Besides seeking to make the director account for the profit he has made, the company seeks to hold him liable for the loss of charter hire to the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, the aggrieved shareholder has itself commenced another derivative action by way of an arbitration on behalf of the company against the original charterer for loss of the charter hire. If the original charterer is found liable to pay the charter hire, then it may be that the director’s alleged breach has not caused any loss of charter hire to the company. The present suit was bifurcated and the hearing before me dealt only with the question of the director’s liability for breach of duty. One of the issues which hence arises is whether, assuming the director is found to have breached his duties, the court should grant a declaration to that effect if the loss arising from that breach might not have crystallised as yet given the pending status of the arbitration proceedings. Would the loss of the charter hire only crystallise if the company fails to recover the outstanding charter hire in the arbitration against the original charterer, or is breach of director’s duties actionable <span class="font-italic">per se</span>?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The joint venture </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendant, Mr Morten Innhaug (“Morten”), incorporated the plaintiff, Nordic International Limited (“Nordic International”) in the British Virgin Islands on 16 January 2007

On the face of the two assignments, they appear to contradict each other. Under the MOA, BGP was purportedly “relieved and released of the obligations under the Time Charter” while under the Notice of Assignment, BGP would “remain liable to [Nordic International] to perform all [its] obligations and liabilities under the Time Charter”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my view, it is a misnomer to describe the Notice of Assignment as an “assignment” of the Time Charter. It is incontrovertible that only the benefits of a contract can be assigned, not the burdens. It was Nordic International who, under the Time Charter, had the right to receive payment of the charter hire from BGP. Hence, if there is any assignment of the Time Charter to speak of, it would be by Nordic International and not BGP to begin with. Nordic International was, however, neither a party to the MOA nor the Notice of Assignment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 BGP did, however, have the option, under clause 17(a) of the Time Charter, of “subletting, assigning or loaning the <span class="font-italic">Vessel</span> to any person or company” not competing with [Nordic International], subject to [Nordic International’s] prior approval "which shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon giving notice in writing to [Nordic International]” (emphasis added). This was provided that BGP remained liable “for the performance of the [Time Charter]” to Nordic International. So what BGP had was the right to assign <span class="font-italic">its use</span> of the vessel, not the Time Charter itself; the property, not the chose in action. As Morten’s email to BGP indicated (see [11]), BGP was transferring the operation of the Vessel to Nordic Maritime.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As for the seismic services agreement,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>BGP did assign to NGS its right to receive the seismic services fees from TGS. That was an assignment of a chose in action. The Notice of Assignment stated that its validity would be governed by the laws of the United Kingdom.

Under these provisions, express notice in writing must be given to the “debtor…from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim [the] debt or chose in action”. BGP is the assignor while TGS is the debtor. The Notice of Assignment was, however, addressed from BGP to NGS, not to TGS. The MOA, on the other hand, was signed both by BGP and TGS. It may well be that only the MOA, and not the Notice of Assignment constituted the statutorily required “express notice in writing” to the debtor (TGS). That, however, is not a matter I have to decide. I am not, for the purposes of this case, concerned with the validity of any of these “assignments”. Instead, I am only concerned with whether Morten’s structuring of these arrangements was in breach of his duties as a director of Nordic International. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Since both parties have consistently used the term “assignment” in their pleadings and submissions, this judgment will continue to use “assignment” to refer to the arrangement involving BGP’s purported “assignment” of the Time Charter as well as the benefit of the seismic services agreement to NGS, subject to the caveats about the use of this descriptive term as mentioned above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The net effect of the two purported assignments is that BGP was taken out of the equation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>TGS but remained liable to Nordic International for the charter hire under a rather convoluted arrangement.

Therefore, Morten claims that Kjell’s email of 9 September 2008 to Mike Sim and Lay Ling constituted notice of the assignment before it was executed.

</div> This submission is of no legal consequence in any event since, as I have observed at [25] above, there was never any valid assignment of the Time Charter to begin with. Therefore strictly speaking, whether the requisite “notice” was given does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Notwithstanding the dispute over the actual date of the assignment, it is undisputed that Morten did not involve the Sinwa directors in the discussions with BGP over the purported assignment. Morten ostensibly justified this approach on the basis that so long as he had taken steps to ensure that Nordic International was not any worse off from the assignment, there was no necessity to involve them in the discussions. His aim was to maintain a good commercial relationship with BGP given that the seismic services industry was a niche market with very few players.

</div> A court would be slow to interfere with commercial decisions of directors which have been honestly made even if they turned out to be financially detrimental, but this does not mean the court would stop short of interfering as long as the directors claim to be genuinely acting to promote the company’s interests (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v </span><span class="font-italic">Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Scintronix</span>”) at [37]–[38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The no-conflict rule obliges a director, as a fiduciary, to avoid any situation where his personal interest conflicts with or may conflict with that of the company whose interest he is bound to protect, such that there is a risk he may prefer his interest over that of the company’s. The rule is strict: where a director is found to have placed himself in a position of conflict of interest, he will not be permitted to assert that his action was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or thought to be in the interests of the company (<span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law</span> at para 8.44, citing <span class="font-italic">Howard Smith Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ampol Petroleum Ltd </span>[1974] AC 821 at 834). A director can be in breach of the rule even though his or her own conduct has caused no loss to the company (<span class="font-italic">Company Directors: Duties, Liabilities, and Remedies</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Simon Mortimore ed) (Oxford University Press, 2009) at para 14.11, citing <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver </span>[1967] 2 AC 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings)</span>”) at 134, 153) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The no-profit rule obliges a director not to retain any profit which he has made through the use of the company’s property, information or opportunities to which he has access by virtue of being a director, without the fully informed consent of the company. The rule is again a strict one and liability to account arises simply because profits are made (see <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) </span>at 144). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The rule against self-dealing prohibits a director from entering, on behalf of the company, into an arrangement or transaction with himself or with a company or firm in which he is interested (see <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Thye v Refco (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in members’ voluntary liquidation) </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1069 at [29]). There is “self-dealing” because the director essentially acts on behalf of both parties in such a transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It can be seen that there is indeed overlap between the no-conflict rule, no-profit rule, and rule against self-dealing. A director who enters into a self-dealing transaction would inevitably be in a position of conflict and, if a profit is made, would be in breach of the duty not to make a profit out of his position. For that reason, the no-profit rule and rule against self-dealing have been described as particular instances of the broader duty of a director not to place himself in a position of conflict (see <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law</span> at para 8.45).

It is also necessary to understand Morten’s real reasons for adopting the route which he eventually did. The assignment of the Time Charter was never intended to be an end in itself. Morten’s interest was not in the assignment of the Time Charter <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. The seismic services agreement was the true prize to him. In his words, the novation of the seismic services agreement “was the most critical in this deal”.

</div> This was after all the lucrative source of revenue. Once the revenue from the seismic services agreement was secured with the MOA, Morten then took steps for the assignment of the Time Charter from BGP to NGS in order to secure the use of the Vessel to perform the seismic services agreement with TGS.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In order to fully appreciate Nordic International’s case, it is also imperative to recognise that the <span class="font-italic">only</span> asset of Nordic International was the Vessel. Hence, its <span class="font-italic">only</span> source of revenue was to earn charter hire from the Vessel. It follows that all directors including Morten owed a duty to ensure the preservation of Nordic International’s contractual rights to earn the charter hire due and payable under the Time Charter. It should be recalled that the Time Charter with BGP had already been secured for three years, with monthly charter hire in excess of $1m, by the time Sinwa was invited to invest in Nordic International. That must have an important consideration in Sinwa’s decision to invest as well as its decision to act as the guarantor for the bank loan to Nordic International. After all, the charter hire was to be used by Nordic International to pay off the monthly loan repayments to OCBC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Yet, when BGP expressed its desire for premature termination of the Time Charter in August 2008, its negotiations with Morten proceeded without any discussion of <span class="font-italic">any</span> compensation payable by BGP to Nordic International.

</div> The stance Morten took was therefore quite unusual given that the Time Charter still had just under two years to run and especially since Morten’s own counsel acknowledged that it was unlikely that BGP had any right of early termination without paying compensation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is clear that Morten was not exactly sure how the existing Time Charter could be rearranged “contractually” to allow BGP to exit without immediate financial consequences to BGP. In the words of Mr Tan, Morten sought a “win-win” situation. Morten believed this could be achieved by way of the MOA and the Notice of Assignment. Through the MOA and the Notice of Assignment, Morten <span class="font-italic">via</span> NGS would effectively take over the Time Charter as well as the seismic services agreement from BGP. The intention was for BGP to exit both the Time Charter as well as the seismic services agreement with the important qualification that BGP was to remain responsible to Nordic International “to perform all [its] obligations and liabilities” under the Time Charter. This proviso was separately set out in the Notice of Assignment and not in the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It appears to me that this somewhat convoluted arrangement was conceived to enable Morten to avoid having to involve Nordic International (and, in particular, the Sinwa directors) directly in the negotiations with BGP and/or TGS. To do otherwise would risk Sinwa finding out about it and Morten candidly acknowledged during the trial that he was concerned that Sinwa would object, which would in turn scuttle the new arrangements with BGP and TGS. For this reason, Nordic International was neither a party to the MOA nor the Notice of Assignment. This is extremely odd, to say the least, given that Nordic International was a party to the Time Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 What was Morten’s reason for restructuring the existing contractual arrangements in this rather unconventional manner? It seems to me that he was primarily driven by three key considerations, each of which reveals that he prioritised his personal interest over Nordic International’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, he was keen to preserve the goodwill of BGP. He described BGP as a “big government company in China” who “promised to give us work so that we can resume their payment” to Nordic International.

This led him first to conclude the MOA with BGP and TGS. However, that alone would not have been sufficient for BGP to exit the Time Charter since Nordic International was conspicuously not a party to the MOA. Morten sought legal advice on the purported assignment after the MOA was negotiated.

</div> The Notice of Assignment was crafted in such a way that BGP was to remain liable to Nordic International under the Time Charter but NGS was to indemnify BGP for all sums payable by BGP to Nordic International. Through this method, Morten was hoping to achieve his objective of <span class="font-italic">notionally</span> allowing BGP to exit the Time Charter and the seismic services agreement without directly engaging Nordic International. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, upon completion of the three-year charter period, BGP has the option to purchase the Vessel at a discounted price of US$5m. With the assignment, Morten through NGS would have the right to exercise the option. At the material time, the Vessel was valued at about US$30m, according to a valuation report dated 16 April 2010 which Nordic Maritime commissioned Altech Maritime Consultants Pte Ltd to produce.

</div> The upside from the exercise of the option to purchase was therefore very significant. Although Morten has confirmed under cross-examination that he no longer has any intention to exercise the option, that was because of the deteriorated condition of the Vessel due to the lengthy ongoing dispute between the parties. But Morten did in fact indicate his intention to exercise the option to purchase the Vessel in a letter from NGS to Nordic International one month before the expiry of the Time Charter in September 2010 (although he did not eventually give formal notice of the exercise of the option).

</div> In any case, that Morten did not eventually exercise the option does not change the fact that the valuable option to purchase played an important part in his decision to proceed as he did in keeping Nordic International out of the loop. Acquiring the option to buy the Vessel at a discounted price of US$5m was one of two benefits that he gained from the assignment of the Time Charter and seismic services agreement to NGS – the other being the increased seismic services fees due from TGS.

</div> Furthermore, the additional revenue arising from the assignment of the seismic services agreement would not have been earned by Nordic International in any event. In short, Morten assumed that Nordic International’s interests were unlikely to be prejudiced by the MOA and/or the Notice of Assignment. Accordingly, Morten submits that the assignment was in the best interests of Nordic International.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I disagree that the purported assignment was in the best interests of Nordic International. Morten had no right to unilaterally make the decision as regards the MOA and the Notice of Assignment without referring the matter to Nordic International. In <span class="font-italic">Innhaug</span><span class="font-italic"> (OS 22)</span> the court found that, contrary to Morten’s position, all directors were obliged to come to a “<span class="font-italic">unanimous decision</span>” both on the Notice of Assignment and the MOA. In choosing to do so without Sinwa’s concurrence, Morten subjected Nordic International’s rights against BGP under the Time Charter to risks of challenge on grounds extraneous to the terms of the Time Charter. Indeed, this has now come to pass. BGP is claiming that the Time Charter has been novated pursuant to the MOA which was allegedly executed by Nordic Maritime “for and on behalf of itself and [Nordic International], [TGS], and [BGP]”. On that basis, BGP has claimed that it is no longer liable to Nordic International for the outstanding charter hire.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Additionally, it is erroneous for Morten to claim that Nordic International was not any worse off on the basis that the terms of the Time Charter had remained unchanged despite the Notice of Assignment. It is a fact that Nordic International had ceased receiving charter hire for the Vessel since December 2008. BGP has purported to justify its cessation of charter hire by reason of the MOA. Nordic International has brought a claim against Morten for “causing the withholding of charter hire”. As the Time Charter was for three years commencing in June 2007, monthly charter hire of  about US$1m would have been payable by BGP to Nordic International till June 2010, a further period of 16 months. Further, the fact that there is a pending arbitration against BGP for the outstanding charter hire where the outcome remains unknown does not alter the fact that Nordic International had stopped receiving its monthly charter hire since December 2008. Looking at the events which have taken place following the MOA and the Notice of Assignment, it is plainly incorrect for Morten to claim that Nordic International has not been any worse off by reason of the Notice of Assignment. It was starved of its monthly source of income. Yet it remained liable for the monthly ship management fees due to Nordic Maritime in addition to the monthly loan repayments to OCBC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In any event, the fact that Nordic International may subsequently recover against BGP is strictly irrelevant in determining whether Morten was in breach of his duties given that it is common ground between the parties that breach of director’s duties is actionable without proof of damage. Morten’s breach was simply in entering into this commercial rearrangement involving the purported assignments in spite of his personal interest conflicting with that of Nordic International’s. Any recovery from BGP would at best affect the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of the damages that Morten’s breach has caused Nordic International. However, as far as <span class="font-italic">liability</span> is concerned, “a director’s liability for disloyalty in office does not depend on proof of fault or proof that a conflict of interest has in fact caused the company loss” (<span class="font-italic">Premier Waste Management Ltd v Towers </span>[2012] 1 BCLC 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Premier Waste Management</span>”) at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In addition, where the fiduciary has made a profit and thereby breached the no-conflict rule, his liability to account does not depend on whether the company has suffered any loss. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer Systems </span><span class="font-italic">(S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan </span>[2014] 1 SLR 847 at [13], making the fiduciary account for an unauthorised profit is a gains-based remedy for the fiduciary’s breach of duty. That remedy is “unrelated to whether the fiduciary’s conduct has <span class="font-italic">caused any loss</span> to the principal” (emphasis added). The remedy ensures that a fiduciary is not allowed to retain any profit made from or attributed to his breach of duty (at [17] and [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  The proper thing for Morten to have done was to involve Nordic International and, consequently, the Sinwa directors in the exit negotiations with BGP in order to negotiate and/or secure compensation for early termination. At the minimum, as Mike Sim suggested, there should have been board meetings to discuss the purported assignment and resolutions passed in this regard.

</div> Morten should have consulted the other directors on whether they wished to consider other options in dealing with BGP’s request to exit the tripartite arrangement between Nordic International, BGP and TGS. This would have been in the best interests of Nordic International. Morten did not pursue this course of action because he had a direct interest in securing the novation of the seismic services agreement from BGP and TGS. Claiming compensation from BGP under the Time Charter would have undermined and in all likelihood ruined Morten’s plan to secure the novation of the seismic services agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) No possibility of conflict   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Morten argues that Nordic International and NGS are involved in two different businesses – Nordic International was a ship owner while NGS was a charterer. Therefore, there could be no real possibility of conflict of interest, nor could Nordic International make the profit that NGS stood to make as a result of the assignment of the seismic services agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Under the MOA, Morten through NGS stood to earn US$15,500 per day. The fact that Nordic International “could not, or would not, take advantage of the opportunity” to earn the additional revenue arising from novation of the seismic services agreement with TGS does not render it any less a breach of his duty not to place himself in a position of conflict (see <span class="font-italic">Premier Waste Management </span>at [10]). <span class="font-italic">In Re Allied Business and Financial Consultants Ltd </span>[2009] 2 BCLC 666, Rimer LJ added that it was not only irrelevant that the company could not take up the corporate opportunity, it was equally irrelevant that the opportunity was not within the company’s “scope of business” (at [70]). Hence, I reject Morten’s submission that there could be no possibility of conflict of interest because Nordic International’s business was different from that of NGS’.

</div> In any event, back in September 2007 when there seemed to be a possibility that BGP might not be involved in the commercial arrangement, Mike Sim in fact floated the idea of “doing [the] deal direct with [TGS], and removing BGP altogether”.

</div> So it was not entirely the case that Nordic International and NGS had completely separate businesses such that any opportunity that came to Morten in his capacity as owner of NGS was not an opportunity that Nordic International could be interested in.

</div> I do not accept this submission. Morten effectively substituted NGS for BGP, the original charterer of the Vessel. NGS used the Vessel and in return, NGS paid the charter hire to Nordic International. In this way, Morten was representing the interests of both parties in this transaction. The rule against self-dealing is hence engaged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Causing the withholding of charter hire </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In addition to the above, the assignment clearly caused Morten to continue to act against the best interests of Nordic International. This is exemplified in his inexplicable conduct in initially stopping Sinwa from commencing arbitration proceedings on behalf of Nordic International against BGP for the outstanding charter hire payable under the Time Charter even though he is a director and a 50 percent shareholder of Nordic International. Such conduct is entirely inconsistent with his duty to act in the best interests of Nordic International to pursue a legitimate claim against BGP for the charter hire due under the Time Charter. He explained under cross-examination that to sue BGP for the outstanding charter hire would effectively “end” <span class="font-italic">his</span> hopes for “long-term” business with BGP.

</div>
</div> Further, under the Notice of Assignment, while BGP is intended to remain liable to Nordic International, NGS is in turn liable to BGP for all charter hire and other monies payable by BGP to Nordic International under the Time Charter. This was effectively an arrangement for NGS to indemnify BGP in respect of the charter hire which would render it unattractive for NGS and hence Morten to allow Nordic International to sue BGP. In fact, a separate version of the minutes of the shareholders’ meeting of Nordic International on 24 October 2011 proposed by Sinwa recorded that Morten had opposed the arbitration because “BGP would [then] go after Nordic Maritime/NGS”. Morten confirmed that this had been his concern.

</div> This also explains Morten’s motivation in initially stopping Sinwa from pursuing arbitration against BGP. It is therefore disingenuous for Morten to argue that he was not in breach in attempting to stop Nordic International from pursuing its legitimate claim against BGP for the outstanding charter hire. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 This unsatisfactory position also caused Morten to call a shareholders’ meeting of Nordic International in order to create a “deadlock” with the specific object of triggering the deadlock clause in the shareholders’ agreement in order to buy back Sinwa’s shares. This culminated in the partial award in his favour (see [24] above). Morten was hoping to bring an end to all the litigation between the parties including this action by buying Sinwa out of Nordic International so that he could go after BGP himself and be the sole beneficiary of the arbitration against BGP.

It was evidently in his own best interest.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As a result of the purported assignment, BGP has denied any liability to pay the charter hire from December 2008 in reliance on the MOA. Morten further obstructed Nordic International’s attempt to recover the outstanding charter hire from BGP. Hence, Morten “[caused] the withholding of charter hire” to Nordic International. This was not in the best interests of Nordic International. He did not act in the best interests of Nordic International since he had multiple contradictory reasons for stopping it from going after BGP.  First, he was concerned that it would end any possibility of his own future dealings with BGP. Second, BGP would then go after NGS for the same loss under the Notice of Assignment. Third, he was hoping to go after BGP for the unpaid charter hire himself after buying out Sinwa’s shares. It is apparent that as a result of his personal motivation to benefit from the seismic services agreement with TGS, Morten found himself in an entirely unsatisfactory position of being unable to discharge his duty as a director to act in the best interests of Nordic International.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By procuring the purported assignment, Morten also stood to profit by gaining the option to purchase the Vessel at a discounted price after the completion of the charter period.

An objective observer would conclude, in my view, that Morten did not act honestly. There was clearly an intent on Morten’s part to gain an “improper benefit or advantage” in unilaterally undertaking the negotiation of the purported assignments with BGP.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is important to distinguish between ratification of the transaction which was brought about by a breach of fiduciary duty and “ratification” of the director’s breach of duty. The latter instance of “ratification” is more appropriately understood as a “release” from liability. As to that, the general principle is that, as noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Scintronix</span> at [59], “directors may be released from their obligations to the company by unanimous, or at the very least majority agreement of the <span class="font-italic">shareholders</span>” (emphasis in original). But just because a company ratifies or adopts the transaction in question does not mean it has released the errant director from liability for breach of duty (see Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 9.116; Paul L. Davies and Sarah Worthington, <span class="font-italic">Gower and Davies: Principles of Modern Company Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2012)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 16-188). This is a specific application, in the context of companies and their directors, of a rule pertaining to principals and agents: a principal may choose to ratify an unauthorised transaction that the agent entered into with a third party without exonerating that agent of any breach of duty (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Kim Hai Edward v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 540 at [80]).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 While the ratification of the unauthorised transaction may be implied from “the mere acquiescence or inactivity of the principal” (see <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Gee Seng v Quek Choon Teck and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 241 at [35]), care must be taken not to equate that with ratification of the breach. It has been suggested that the director should go about obtaining ratification “by making a full and frank disclosure and calling together the general body of the shareholders” to ask that the breach be ratified (see <span class="font-italic">Bamford</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bamford </span>[1970] Ch 212 at 237, cited in <span class="font-italic">Scintronix</span> at [59]). In other words, the informed consent of the shareholders is required. It appears that such consent of the shareholders need not always be given formally, by way of a resolution, although the shareholders must at minimum know of and consent to the breach. In <span class="font-italic">Chin Siew Seng v </span><span class="font-italic">Quah Hun Kok Francis and another appeal </span>[2010] SGCA 44, the director was allegedly in breach of his fiduciary duties in diverting commissions due to the company as well as its ship-brokering business to a company he incorporated. The Court of Appeal found that the director did not breach his fiduciary duty as all the directors and shareholders “knew and consented” to the latter company’s receipt of the ship-brokering commissions (at [29]). However, the Court reached this conclusion having found that (a) the other shareholders did not at any time object to the diversion of commissions; and (b) there was an agreement that the businesses of the company would be split up and that the director would be free to pursue his own ship-brokering business (at [27]–[28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Many of the arguments raised by both sides address the question of whether Nordic International had by its conduct ratified the assignment, but it is important to bear in mind that ratification of the assignment is not necessarily ratification of Morten’s breach of duty in procuring it. Morten places emphasis on the fact that Sinwa (a) did not inform OCBC that it objected to the assignment; (b) made no protest when Nordic International continued to receive charter hire for the months of October 2008 to December 2008; and (c) did not write to BGP to object to the assignment.

As mentioned earlier, Morten through NGS stood to make an additional sum of US$15,500 per day from the assignment of both the Time Charter and the seismic services agreement. Morten explained that the additional daily charter hire rate of US$5000 was meant to cover the cost of an extra compressor that TGS wanted, as well as the extra cost of hiring Nordic Maritime’s crew.

</div> In other words, his breaches did not cause the withholding of the charter hire. The second argument can be immediately rejected – it is a completely speculative assertion. There is no evidence that BGP would have terminated the Time Charter in any event. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary: Mr Tan accepted that BGP had no right of termination of the Time Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 That leaves the first argument on whether the loss has crystallised. I find this argument both ironic and somewhat facetious. One of the reasons why the loss has yet to crystallise is because the arbitration against BGP is still pending. The principal reason for this state of affairs is because Morten had initially opposed the arbitration. It is therefore incongruous for Morten to rely on the precise fact constituting the breach of duty – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his delaying of the pursuit of the claim against BGP – to ground his argument that the loss flowing from that breach has not crystallised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 To be clear, the issue here is not one of causation. Had Morten not brought about the purported assignment, BGP would not have been able to rely on the MOA to deny its liability under the Time Charter. The loss has already occurred because Nordic International has not been paid the charter hire it was entitled to for the months of January to June 2009, the period of the outstanding charter hire for which leave of the Court of Appeal was granted to pursue in this action. Rather, the issue is about what the remedy of equitable compensation, which Nordic International seeks, is meant to achieve. In <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Redferns (a firm) and another</span> [1996] 1 AC 421 Lord Browne-Wilkinson said at 439: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Equitable compensation for breach of trust is designed to achieve exactly what the word compensation suggests: to make good a loss in fact suffered by the beneficiaries and which, using hindsight and common sense, can be seen to have been caused by the breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In this case, Nordic International has commenced an arbitration against BGP for the loss of the charter hire. Until the conclusion of that arbitration, one cannot know for certain whether, “using hindsight and common sense”, Morten’s breach in causing the withholding of charter hire led to any loss. It must be borne in mind that even if Nordic International prevails in the arbitration, it may not be entitled to claim, as against Morten, the full sum of outstanding charter hire for the months of January to June 2009. This is because the charterer would have been entitled to a reduction of the charter hire once the Vessel was laid up, pursuant to cl 5(d) of the Time Charter, as noted by Andrew Ang J in his judgment for OS 960 (see <span class="font-italic">Sinwa</span><span class="font-italic"> (OS 960)</span> at [40]). Thus, proof of Nordic International’s precise loss can only be determined after the conclusion of the arbitration. Even then, to arrive at the proper quantum representing the loss of charter hire to Nordic International as a result of Morten’s breach, it would be necessary to deduct the expenses which Nordic International would have incurred in earning that charter hire.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In response to my invitation to submit additional authorities to address the question of the appropriate relief, Mr Soh brought several additional cases to my attention in support of his submission that the assessment of the loss in this case can be reserved with liberty to apply for directions. Three of them are broadly relevant (<span class="font-italic">Deeny</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Gooda Walker Ltd (in liquidation) (No 3)</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1206; <span class="font-italic">China Resources Purchasing Co Ltd v Yue Xiu Enterprises </span><span class="font-italic">(S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 397; and <span class="font-italic">Freight Connect (S) Pte Ltd v Paragon Shipping Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 178)). In each of these cases, the defendant had to indemnify the plaintiff in respect for losses flowing from claims made against the plaintiff by third parties. With respect to claims by third parties which have yet to be made, the courts have held that the assessment of damages should be reserved until after those claims have been finally determined. Here, the situation is slightly different. Unlike the other cases which dealt with a pending<span class="font-italic"> loss</span> to third parties, Nordic International has a pending <span class="font-italic">claim </span>against BGP. Nonetheless, what these cases demonstrate is that a court has the power to defer the assessment of damages when the liability of a defendant to a plaintiff is contingent on an action between a plaintiff and a third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Here, as I have found, Morten did indeed breach his fiduciary duties. Given that the claim against BGP is still pending, the sensible solution seems to be to order an assessment of the appropriate amount of compensation in respect of loss of charter hire caused by Morten’s breach of fiduciary duty but to direct that such assessment take place only after the conclusion of the arbitration between Nordic International and BGP. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In conclusion, I allow Nordic International’s claim and order that an account be taken of the profits which Morten has made in procuring the purported assignment. The quantum of compensation that Morten is liable to Nordic International for causing the withholding of charter hire is to be reserved for assessment until the conclusion of the arbitration between Nordic International and BGP. Nordic International shall have liberty to apply for that assessment to be restored following the outcome of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Nordic International will have the costs of this action which I fix at $110,000 inclusive of disbursements. Costs of Summons No 2567 of 2012 which related to an injunction hearing before Quentin Loh J was reserved. Taking into account the subsequent events which have transpired following Loh J’s Order of Court dated 14 March 2013, I order each party to bear their own costs in respect of the injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anthony Soh Leong Kiat (Via Law Corporation), Andrew Ho Yew Cheng and June Lim Pei Ling (instructed) for the plaintiff;<br/>Joseph Tan Wee Kong and Joanna Poh Ying Ying (Legal Solutions LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
