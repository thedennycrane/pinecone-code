The minority shareholder made a number of claims against Mr Ong in the Oppression Suit. The claim which is relevant for present purposes was that Mr Ong had wrongfully diverted the corporate opportunity to acquire the Property away from the second defendant to himself, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> through the first defendant and the Company as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Nine other individuals and companies associated with Mr Ong were also named as defendants in the Oppression Suit. These additional defendants included the first defendant and the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Oppression Suit concluded at first instance in April 2017 with a judgment by Judith Prakash JA. That judgment can be found at <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings Ltd v Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corp Pte Ltd and others (Foo Peow Yong Douglas, third party) and another suit</span> [2017] SGHC 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span>”).

In any event, even if the first defendant had taken the point, I would have rejected it. The critical points to my mind are that: (a) it is undisputed that the parties have an arbitration agreement; and (b) when the plaintiff commenced the arbitration in September 2019 and when it filed this application in October 2019, there is nothing before me to suggest that its intention was not to proceed in the arbitration to an award in the usual way. In other words, there is nothing to suggest that the arbitration is a pretext, contrived by the plaintiff in bad faith simply to enliven the court’s power under s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) for some ulterior purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I consider that the court’s power under s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is available so long as an arbitration commenced <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> continues in existence, even though it may be stayed. The fact of a stay goes only to the court’s discretion whether to grant relief and, if so, as to the duration of the relief. I therefore do not consider that the parties’ wish to stay the arbitration in May 2020 can deprive me of the power which the Act vested in me at the time the plaintiff commenced these proceedings. That power continues to be vested in me so long as the arbitration is extant and so long as it has not been irrevocably supplanted by another method of resolving the substantive underlying dispute. I will consider the significance of a stay when I consider the exercise of my discretion (see [114]–[116] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">This application is not irregular</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I reject the first defendant’s preliminary point. The plaintiff’s failure to amend its notice of arbitration to refer to the settlement and the settlement sum does not break the nexus which is necessary between this application and the arbitration to bring it within the scope of s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 First, on liability, the cause of action which the plaintiff asserts against the first defendant in the arbitration arises from the falsification of the representations and warranties in the Agreement. The settlement undoubtedly has compromised the second defendant’s cause of action against the Company. But it does not in any way affect the plaintiff’s cause of action against the first defendant under the Agreement. Despite the settlement, that cause of action continues to remain at the foundation of the arbitration, and thereby of the injunction which the plaintiff seeks in this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Second, on quantum, the tribunal will not be precluded from considering the settlement and its effect on the plaintiff’s case simply because the plaintiff has not referred to the settlement or the settlement sum in the notice of arbitration. As it stands, the plaintiff’s notice sets the quantum of the plaintiff’s alleged loss at large and squarely within the tribunal’s jurisdiction. The notice recites the facts underlying the GREIH Suit, recites the background to the Agreement, lists the various representations and warranties which the plaintiff relies on and recites the Oppression Suit and Prakash JA’s findings. It concludes by praying for relief. As part of that relief, the plaintiff does not pray for $14.3m – or indeed any liquidated sum – by way of damages. Instead, the plaintiff prays generally for “damages to be assessed”.

These matters obviously include the reduction in the amount of the plaintiff’s substantive claim by reason of the settlement as well as any allegation that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss. If the arbitration is not stayed, the plaintiff’s failure to refer to the settlement in the notice of arbitration has no impact on the plaintiff’s ability to plead the settlement in its Statement of Claim, to adduce evidence on that fact and on the tribunal’s jurisdiction or power to award damages – if it thinks it fit – by reference to the settlement sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 For these reasons, it is clear to me that the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction which the plaintiff seeks in this application was and continues to be sought “for the purposes of” or “in relation to” the arbitration.

</div> and also to the principle that a tribunal which decides an issue which has not been properly “pleaded” may go beyond its jurisdiction. I do not consider the notice of arbitration to be a “pleading” in the usual sense of the word. A Statement of Claim and a Statement of Defence in an arbitration governed by the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) are obviously pleadings. But a notice of arbitration is more fundamental than the pleadings and in fact operates on a higher plane. A notice of arbitration is constitutional in nature. The notice of arbitration alone exhaustively defines the parameters within which the pleadings, the parties, the tribunal and its award must operate. For the reasons I have given, the plaintiff’s notice of arbitration is drawn sufficiently widely to bring within the tribunal’s jurisdiction all issues relating to liability and quantum arising from the settlement and the settlement sum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">mareva</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The parties are agreed on the legal test which I should apply to determine whether to grant a <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction against the first defendant.

</div> I have listed those proceedings at [8] above. The short answer to this argument is that the arbitration is the only proceeding involving the first defendant. The other three proceedings involve either Mr Ong and his associates or the second defendant. It is true that the plaintiff and the Company have made several claims through these proceedings for compensation from several parties arising from the same underlying facts. As a result, of course, there will have to be safeguards to ensure that there is no double recovery in respect of the same loss. These safeguards will of course have to consider the plaintiff’s and the company’s combined economic interests holistically. But these safeguards are quite often required where multiple related companies have multiple related causes of action against multiple related defendants. And the plaintiff accepts that these safeguards will be necessary.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This submission is misconceived. The plaintiff’s claim on the Agreement is a claim in breach of contract. The claim rests on express representation and warranties in the Agreement. The plaintiff bargained for these representations and warranties and provided consideration for them. That is why they are expressly incorporated into the Agreement. The plaintiff’s claim does not rest on pre-contractual representations unsupported by consideration and supported only by reliance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Liability for breach of contract is ordinarily strict. It does not depend on showing fault, let alone fraud in the sense of <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1889) LR 14 App Cas 337. I therefore hold that there is a good arguable case that the first defendant will be liable to the plaintiff under cl 9.1(a) in respect of any express representation or warranty set out in Schedule 6 of the Agreement which the plaintiff can prove is untrue, inaccurate or misleading within the meaning of cl 9.1(a) even if the first defendant made the representation to the plaintiff or gave the warranty to the plaintiff with a reasonable basis or with an honest belief in its truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 That is, of course subject to contrary agreement. Of the four paragraphs of Schedule 6 on which the plaintiff relies, only paragraph 8 imports any requirement of awareness on the first defendant’s part. The first defendant’s liability on the three remaining paragraphs will be engaged simply if the plaintiff is able to show that the representation or warranty is untrue, inaccurate or misleading. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In any event, cl 9.1(b) of the Agreement expressly attributes Mr Ong’s knowledge to the first defendant and deems him to have knowledge of any matter which he would have discovered upon reasonable inquiry:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any [of the first defendant’s] Warranty qualified by the expression ‘to the best of [the first defendant’s] knowledge, information and belief’ or any similar expression shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed to refer to the knowledge of Ong Siew Kwee, Andy who shall be deemed to have knowledge of such matters as he would have discovered had he made reasonable enquiries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To the extent that the plaintiff’s cause of action in contract on any of the four paragraphs of Schedule 6 requires the plaintiff to show that the first defendant made the representation or gave the warranty which is proven to be false without a reasonable basis or an honest belief in its truth, I consider that the reasonable inferences to be drawn from Prakash JA’s findings against Mr Ong coupled with the contractual attribution effected by cl 9.1(b) of the Agreement suffice to establish a good arguable case that the first defendant lacked the necessary basis or belief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now take the four paragraphs of Schedule 6 on which the plaintiff relies in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paragraph 3.3 of Schedule 6 to the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Paragraph 3.3 of Schedule 6 contains a representation and warranty that the Company incurred all of its liabilities in the ordinary course of its business and that those liabilities were either all disclosed or provided for in its accounts or specifically disclosed in or for the purposes of the Agreement itself: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are no liabilities, whether actual or contingent, of the Company other than (i) liabilities disclosed or provided for in the [the Company’s consolidated accounts for the period commencing from the date of incorporation up to 30 June 2013]; (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary and usual course of business, none of which is material; or (iii) liabilities disclosed elsewhere in this Agreement or the [information provided by the first defendant to the plaintiff about the Company and the Property].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Mr Ong caused the second defendant wrongfully to transfer $14.3m to the Company. There is therefore a good arguable case that the transfer created a contingent liability in Company to repay the $14.3m to the second defendant. That transfer took place before the date of the Agreement. The contingent liability therefore existed when the parties entered into the Agreement. Further, it was Mr Ong who carried out the wrongful transfer. His knowledge is imputed to the first defendant by cl 9.1(b) of the Agreement.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The plaintiff therefore has, at the very least, a good arguable case that the first defendant had knowledge of the transfer of $14.3m, knowledge that the transfer was wrongful and knowledge of the contingent liability arising from the wrongful transfer. On the basis of Prakash JA’s findings, this contingent liability was not incurred in the ordinary course of the Company’s business. It was not disclosed or provided for in the Company’s accounts. There is no suggestion that the first defendant ever specifically disclosed this contingent liability in or for the purposes of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I therefore find that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the representation and warranty in paragraph 3.3 of the Agreement was untrue, inaccurate or misleading when it was made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2(iii) of Schedule 6</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 By paragraph 4.1.1 of Schedule 6, the first defendant represented and warranted that the Company is the “sole legal and beneficial owner” of the Property. By paragraph 4.1.2(iii), the first defendant warranted that the Property is free of encumbrances, except those disclosed in the same paragraph. Clause 1.1 of the Agreement defines “encumbrance” as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… any claim, charge, mortgage, lien, option, equity, power of sale, hypothecation, retention of title, right of pre-emption, right of first refusal or other third party right or security interest of any kind or an agreement, arrangement or obligation to create any of the foregoing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 But Prakash JA found in the Oppression Suit that the Company had used the sum of $14.3m – which Mr Ong had wrongfully transferred to it – to purchase the Property (see <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>at [106]). Clause 9.1(b) expressly provides that Mr Ong’s knowledge is attributed to the first defendant. That means that the first defendant knew that the Company purchased the Property with money wrongfully transferred from the second defendant. There is therefore a good arguable case that the second defendant has some sort of an equitable interest or traceable interest in the Property. That was precisely one of the second defendant’s claims in the GREIH Suit. If that could be established, that would mean that the Company is not the sole beneficial owner of the Property and that the Property is not free of encumbrances as defined in the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I therefore find that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the representations and warranties in paragraphs 4.1.1 and 4.1.2(iii) were untrue, inaccurate or misleading when they were made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paragraph 5.2 of Schedule 6</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 By paragraph 5.2 of Schedule 6, the first defendant represented and warranted that the Company had entered into all of its transactions in the ordinary course of its business and at arm’s length:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Company] is not a party to or subject to any contract, transaction, arrangement, understanding or obligation which … is not in the ordinary and usual course of business; or … is not wholly on an arm’s length basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Prakash JA’s findings in the Oppression Suit establishes, at the very least, a good arguable case that the Company was a party to a transaction – under which it received the $14.3m from the second defendant – which was not in the ordinary course of the Company’s business and which was not on a wholly arm’s length basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I therefore find that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the representation and warranty in paragraph 5.2 was untrue, inaccurate or misleading when it was made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paragraph 8 of Schedule 6</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 By paragraph 8 of Schedule 6, the first defendant represented and warranted that it was not aware of anything which would render the information provided about the Company untrue, inaccurate or misleading: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The first defendant] is not aware of any fact or matter or circumstances not disclosed in writing to [the plaintiff] which renders any [information provided by the first defendant about the Company] untrue, inaccurate or misleading in any material respects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I have already found that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the defendant’s representations and warranties in paragraphs 3.3, 4.1.1 and 4.1.2(iii) of Schedule 6 were false, inaccurate or misleading at the time the first defendant made them. Prakash JA’s findings against Mr Ong in the Oppression Suit establish a good arguable case, at the very least, that he was aware of facts, matters and circumstances which rendered these representations and warranties untrue, inaccurate or misleading at the time the first defendant made them. The express terms of cl 9.1(b) of the Agreement attribute to the first defendant Mr Ong’s knowledge of the underlying facts and matters and also the knowledge he would have had if he had made reasonable inquiries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I therefore find that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that the representation and warranty in paragraph 8 was untrue, inaccurate or misleading when it was made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Recoverable loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The first defendant’s third ground is that the plaintiff does not have a good arguable case that it has suffered recoverable loss.

</div> The first defendant is correct that a shareholder is ordinarily unable to recover damages for this type of loss, commonly known as “reflective loss” (<span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (No 1)</span> [2002] 2 AC 1; <span class="font-italic">Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 597). But the first defendant is incorrect that the reflective loss principle applies to the losses in categories (a) and (d) so as to make them irrecoverable by the plaintiff in the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The reflective loss principle is an aspect of the proper plaintiff principle established in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1843) 67 ER 189. The principle holds that a corporate entity – and not one of its shareholders – is ordinarily the proper plaintiff to recover compensation for a wrong done to that corporate entity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 That principle has no application to the arbitration. The cause of action which the plaintiff pursues in the arbitration is not one vested in the Company or one which the Company can pursue. The plaintiff’s cause of action is against the first defendant under the Agreement. The Company is not a party to the Agreement. It has no cause of action against the first defendant under the Agreement. The party against whom the Company has a cause of action is its former director, Mr Ong. But the plaintiff does not assert any cause of action against Mr Ong in the arbitration. If the first defendant is held liable, there is no principle of law which bars the plaintiff from quantifying its loss in categories (a) and (d) by reference to the diminution in the value of its shares in the Company. Of course, as I have noted at [28] above, the plaintiff accepts that there will have to be safeguards to prevent double recovery. But that does not make the loss irrecoverable as damages for breach of contract on the usual principles, unaffected by the reflective loss principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There is also an express contractual basis on which the plaintiff can recover from the first defendant the diminution in value of its shareholding in the Company. This is under the first defendant’s indemnity in cl 9.9 of the Agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to clause 9.10, [the first defendant] covenants with [the plaintiff] to indemnify and save harmless [the plaintiff] or at <span class="font-italic">its option</span>, the Company from and against any and all losses which [the plaintiff] or the Company (as the case may be) may at any time and from time to time sustain, incur or suffer by reason of any breach of the [the first defendant’s] Warranty under Paragraph 3.3 of Schedule 6 (No Undisclosed Liabilities). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 If the plaintiff establishes that the first defendant is liable under para 3.3 of Schedule 6, cl 9.9 gives the plaintiff a contractual right to recover an indemnity from the first defendant for a loss which either the plaintiff or the Company has suffered, at the plaintiff’s option. The plaintiff can therefore opt to recover an indemnity from the first defendant for the diminution in value of the plaintiff’s shareholding in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For all of these reasons, I hold that the plaintiff has a good arguable case that it has suffered recoverable loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant cannot be liable for two sets of losses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Second, the first defendant argues that cl 9.9 renders the first defendant liable <span class="font-italic">either </span>for the plaintiff’s loss <span class="font-italic">or </span>the Company’s loss, but not for <span class="font-italic">both</span> entities’ loss.

</div> I have set out cl 9.9 at [59] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I reject this argument. I have already accepted that, in so far as either the plaintiff or the Company recovers damages for the same loss, safeguards will have to be introduced to prevent double recovery. That does not make the losses irrecoverable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This argument as advanced by the first defendant amounts to saying that the plaintiff cannot claim an indemnity from the first defendant in respect of a certain head of loss under cl 9.9 if, in the same proceedings, it includes a claim for an indemnity in respect of a separate and distinct head of loss suffered by the Company. That construction of cl 9.9 is impractical and uncommercial. It is impractical because it can easily be circumvented by commencing two separate proceedings, in each of which the plaintiff claims an indemnity for loss suffered by only one of the entities. It is uncommercial because the clear intent of cl 9.9 is to require the plaintiff to opt – in respect of each separate and distinct head of loss – whose loss it intends to pursue. Even then, as the plaintiff points out,

</div> the critical question is not when the plaintiff must exercise its option but preventing double recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Therefore, even if there are overlapping claims in the plaintiff’s case, that does not detract from the plaintiff’s good arguable case under cl 9.9 at this stage. The overlap can be resolved later. All that the plaintiff needs to show now is that: (a) there is a good arguable case that one or the other of the two entities is entitled to recover the sums claimed; and (b) there is a good arguable case that this sum should be included in setting the limit of the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction which the plaintiff seeks. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mitigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The first defendant’s fourth ground is that the plaintiff does not have a good arguable case that the settlement sum and the Company’s legal costs and expenses in the GREIH Suit are reasonable.

I have already found that it does (see [55] above). The plaintiff quantifies the costs now only for the purpose of justifying the limit of the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction which it now seeks. That is a separate point which I deal with separately. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As for the settlement sum, the sum of $1.5m is about 10.5% of the sum of $14.3m which the second defendant claimed against the Company in the GREIH Suit. Where a defendant settles an action at such a small fraction of the sum claimed against it, I consider it self-evident there is a good arguable case that that the defendant has acted reasonably, in so far as the quantum of the settlement sum is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The first defendant also takes the point that the Company acted unreasonably in settling the GREIH Suit because the second defendant’s claim against the Company was time-barred. The second defendant’s case in the GREIH Suit was that Mr Ong wrongfully caused the second defendant to transfer the $14.3m to the Company in September 2012. But the second defendant commenced the GREIH Suit only in November 2018, more than six years after Mr Ong’s alleged breach of duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I reject this argument too. I accept that there was a real risk that the Company could not avail itself of the limitation defence in the GREIH Suit. The second defendant argued in the GREIH Suit that the commencement of the limitation period was postponed because its right of action against the Company to recover the $14.3m had been concealed by fraud. Prakash JA’s findings in the Oppression Suit makes it possible, at the very least, that Mr Ong acted fraudulently in the wrongful transfer of $14.3m from the second defendant to the Company (see the Court of Appeal’s decision on appeal from Prakash JA in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings (CA)</span>”) at [126]–[127]). I also consider it possible, at the very least, that Mr Ong’s fraud was attributable to the Company, with the result that the limitation period would have been postponed despite its change of ownership in 2013 pursuant to the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I therefore consider there is a good arguable case that the plaintiff acted reasonably in the GREIH Suit and that it mitigated its loss both under the general law and for the purposes of paragraph 9.2 of Schedule 3 of the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conditions precedent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The first defendant’s final ground is that the plaintiff does not have a good arguable case that it has complied with the conditions precedent in the Agreement for making a claim.

Sakae had entered into the joint venture as an investor and had partially funded the joint venture, and it would clearly have been its legitimate expectation that its funds would not be mismanaged, much less siphoned away in the way that was done by Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon. As is evident from the numerous sham documents that were fabricated, Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon also engaged in fraudulent schemes to mislead Sakae and Foo and conceal the true nature of the transactions from them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The first transaction that the plaintiff relies on is the Deed.

The first defendant also says that, in 2016 and 2017, as a result of the negative press coverage arising from the Oppression Suit, Mr Ong’s continued association with the first defendant was causing damage to the first defendant’s business reputation. To protect its reputation and re-establish its relationship with its business partners, the first defendant took steps to distance itself from Mr Ong.

So there appears to be a valid commercial benefit to the first defendant from entering into it. However, this apparent commercial reason must be seen in context. First, the first defendant has provided no estimate of what GCM realistically stands to recover in the four proceedings. Further, there is no evidence of the first defendant’s own financial position. It has not filed its annual returns since March 2018. The first defendant was therefore entering into a transaction which was risky on two counts, both as to the burden and also as to the benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, the timing of the Funding Agreement raises suspicion. I have accepted that there is a good arguable case that the first defendant had notice in November 2018 of a potential claim by the plaintiff for breach of the Agreement. The first defendant says that it began negotiating the Funding Agreement with GCM in June 2019.

On the day of the hearing, at the parties’ request and in view of the settlement discussions between the plaintiff and the second defendant, I adjourned the hearing to March 2020. At the same hearing, the parties agreed to add a costs proviso to the first defendant’s undertaking, allowing the first defendant “to use up to $40,000 of its assets towards the payment of its<span class="font-italic"> </span>legal and associated costs”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The first defendant relied on this proviso to pay $40,000 to GCM’s solicitors in February 2020 expressly as “funding pursuant to the Funding Agreement”.

</div> The plaintiff’s position is that this amounts to a breach of the first defendant’s undertaking. The first defendant takes the position that the proviso permits the first defendant to pay $40,000 towards not just its legal fees but also its “associated costs”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that the proviso was not intended to be confined to paying its own legal fees.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I agree with the plaintiff. The first defendant’s position is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst. It will have to be determined on another occasion, if it becomes necessary, which of the two it is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 It was not the intent of the proviso to allow the first defendant to pay GCM up to $40,000 to fund GCM’s legal costs in completely separate proceedings. The intent of the proviso was to allow the first defendant to pay <span class="font-italic">its own</span> solicitors for <span class="font-italic">its own</span> legal costs in <span class="font-italic">these proceedings</span>, as the plaintiff had prayed for in the costs proviso in its application. That was the clear impression which the parties gave me at the hearing itself. I approved the proviso because I agreed that fairness required the first defendant to be able to pay its own solicitors for its own legal costs in these proceedings. The proviso makes express reference to the <span class="font-italic">first defendant’s</span> legal fees through the pronoun “its”. The proviso also permitted the first defendant to make payment of “<span class="font-italic">its</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… associated costs” [emphasis added].  There is just no other way to read the words of the proviso. A payment to a third party under the Funding Agreement is not one of the first defendant’s “associated costs”. It is performance of what is said to be the first defendant’s contractual obligation. This payment was outside the scope of the proviso.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 There is, at the very least, a good arguable case that the first defendant breached its undertaking to the Court by making this payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In the circumstances, I consider that the first defendant’s payment of $40,000 to GCM in February 2020 adds considerable weight to the plaintiff’s good arguable case that there is a real risk that, unless restrained by injunction, the first defendant will dissipate its assets in anticipation of an adverse result in the plaintiff’s claim on the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The discretion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Establishing a good arguable case on the merits of its claim and on the risk of dissipation does not mean that the plaintiff is automatically entitled to a <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I reject this submission for two reasons. First, the first defendant was not a party to the GREIH Suit. There is no basis for the first defendant to assert that the plaintiff behaved inequitably by not involving the first defendant in the negotiations to settle proceedings to which the first defendant was not even a party. Second, Prakash JA found in the Oppression Suit that Mr Ong had wrongfully procured the transfer of $14.3m from the second defendant to the Company. That wrongful transfer has now spawned the proceedings listed in [8] above, as well as this application. Mr Ong continues to be beneficially interested in over 90% of the shares in the first defendant.

</div> Although Mr Ong resigned as a director of the first defendant in 2016, and despite the first defendant’s self-serving protestations to the contrary, I also accept that there is a good arguable case that Mr Ong continues to be a shadow or <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The plaintiff’s exclusion of the first defendant in the settlement negotiations with the second defendant in the GREIH Suit was entirely understandable and perfectly reasonable.

The Rules now in force are the 2016 edition. Rule 30.1 of the 2016 edition Rules allows the tribunal to grant interim relief. That includes <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> relief. The tribunal therefore has the jurisdiction to grant the plaintiff the interim relief which it seeks by this application. Where that is the case, the courts should generally decline to grant interim relief (see <span class="font-italic">NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [51]–[52], [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The plaintiff filed this application shortly after lodging its notice of arbitration, in circumstances of urgency.

</div>
</div>
</div> In these circumstances, I must consider whether it remains appropriate for me rather than the tribunal to grant the plaintiff the interim relief which it seeks in this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I am satisfied that it remains appropriate for me to grant the relief. The critical feature is that the tribunal was constituted <span class="font-italic">after </span>the plaintiff commenced this application. I am also satisfied that, when the plaintiff commenced this application, there were circumstances of urgency warranting this application without waiting for the tribunal to be constituted. In those circumstances, the plaintiff could have secured this interim relief only from the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 It is also the case that the parties want to stay the arbitration and to resolve the plaintiff’s claim on the Agreement through litigation. The parties intend to return to the arbitration only when the litigation is concluded. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that I need not defer to the tribunal in granting the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction, subject only to the point as to duration which I discuss next. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The duration of the order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The plaintiff now asks that the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction continue in force until the final determination of the plaintiff’s claim under the Agreement, without making any reference to the arbitration. The plaintiff is therefore asking for the injunction to continue even though, as the plaintiff and the first defendant have now agreed, their dispute is to be resolved through litigation rather than arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I do not think that that can be correct. Although I have disregarded the fact that the parties want to stay the arbitration when exercising my discretion to grant interim relief under s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act, I cannot ignore a stay in fixing the duration of the injunction. When the plaintiff commences litigation, the resolution of the parties’ substantive dispute on the merits will move to the High Court. When that happens, it will no longer be appropriate for the plaintiff to continue to have the benefit of injunctive relief under s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) in aid of an arbitration when that arbitration will no longer resolve the parties’ substantive dispute on the merits. The injunctive relief to prevent the first defendant from dissipating its assets should then be granted directly in that litigation under Order 29 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) and not indirectly through s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) in aid of a stayed arbitration. The only part of the sum to be enjoined which is referable to the arbitration at that point will be the costs of the arbitration. The bulk of the sum enjoined will no longer be enjoined “for the purpose of and in relation to an arbitration to which [the] Act applies” within the meaning of s 31(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). I consider that in those circumstances, the first defendant’s preliminary point (see [11]–[20] above) will have significantly more force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The injunction I grant today will therefore last only until one of the three following events occurs, whichever is sooner:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An interim award in the arbitration which expressly relates to the whole or part of the injunctive relief granted by this order. This injunction would, in any event, cease to have effect in that event by virtue of s 31(2) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A final award in the arbitration on the merits. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A further order of the Court, whether in this application or in other proceedings between the plaintiff and the first defendant in relation to the subject-matter of the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ancillary issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I have now dealt with the substantive issues raised by the parties. The parties also raise four ancillary issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant asks for provisos to be inserted into the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction to allow it to make certain payments; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff asks the first defendant to disclose its assets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff asks for a sealing order to preserve the confidentiality of the settlement agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The plaintiff asks for an order that it be at liberty to endorse a penal notice on the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">I deal with these four ancillary issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The provisos sought by the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The first ancillary issue is the first defendant’s request to include provisos in the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction permitting it to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Pay its own legal fees for both the arbitration and this application; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Perform its alleged obligations under the Funding Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first defendant’s own legal costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I will include the first proviso in the injunction. The plaintiff has prayed for a <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction in the usual form. That form incorporates the usual proviso permitting the first defendant to spend, subject to the usual conditions, $4,000 a week on legal expenses. This proviso and the applicable conditions are set out in paragraph 3 of the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction which I now make, and which appears at Annex A to this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The proviso will operate only in relation to the first defendant’s own legal fees and disbursements and only in relation to this application and the arbitration. The first defendant can draw under this proviso either to pay fees and disbursements which are due and owing to its own solicitors or which its solicitors require as money to hold on account for anticipated costs and disbursements. The proviso will not operate in relation to the litigation which the plaintiff intends to commence to resolve its claims against the first defendant under the Agreement. The proviso will not operate in relation to any other proceedings involving any other companies related to the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The sum of $4,000 a week may appear low. But this limit of $4,000 per week will apply with effect from 27 November 2019. From 27 November 2019 to 29 July 2020 encompasses 35 weeks. The proviso will therefore operate to establish a fund of $140,000 for the first defendant’s legal fees as at 29 July 2020, with a further $4,000 added to the fund every week thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 This is more than enough for the first defendant’s legal fees. I have already permitted the first defendant by written directions dated 20 April 2020 to pay the first defendant’s solicitors the sum of $32,782.49 for legal costs incurred in these proceedings up to 20 April 2020. It appears also that the first defendant’s solicitors are owed a further $46,672.25. That totals just under $80,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 That leave just over $60,000 available to the first defendant to draw upon. But with this judgment, these proceedings are concluded save for residual issues which will not entail significant costs, if any at all. Further, the parties want to stay the arbitration. The first defendant is unlikely to incur substantial additional costs in it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The funding agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I will not include the second proviso. The plaintiff’s application includes the usual proviso allowing the first defendant to make payments in the ordinary course of its business (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Dalzavod Joint Stock Co </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 813 at [19]–[21]). But the payments which the first defendant proposes to make under the Funding Agreement are not payments in the ordinary course of its business. That is no doubt why the first defendant has specifically asked for a new proviso rather than relying on the proviso already offered in the plaintiff’s application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The first defendant is asking for a proviso to allow it to make payments to perform what it alleges are its contractual obligations. But the obligations are owed to a related party, GCM. The obligations fall outside the ordinary course of its business. The first defendant presumably does not have sufficient assets above the enjoined limit to make these payments. Otherwise, it would not need to seek this proviso. Finally, I bear in mind the defendant’s conduct in making the payment of $40,000 pursuant to the Funding Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In all the circumstances, I decline to include this proviso. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disclosure of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The next ancillary issue that I have to deal with is the plaintiff’s prayer for disclosure in aid of its <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction. The plaintiff’s application includes a prayer that the first defendant be ordered to file and serve an affidavit which sets out all of the first defendant’s assets in Singapore as at 3.00 pm on 25 November 2019. That is the date and time at which the plaintiff notified the first defendant of this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 At the first hearing of this application on 27 November 2019, I was not inclined to make an order for disclosure of assets <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>. I did not see the urgency in having the disclosure order made and complied with. My concern also was that once the first defendant had disclosed its assets to the plaintiff, that disclosure could not be undone if I held against the plaintiff on an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> or setting aside application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Instead, at my suggestion, the first defendant offered an undertaking to have an appropriate deponent from the first defendant who has personal knowledge of its assets swear or affirm – but not file or serve – an affidavit setting out all of the first defendant’s assets in Singapore as at 3.00 pm on 25 November 2019. The first defendant further undertook that that affidavit would be held by the first defendant’s solicitors in a sealed and dated envelope pending my further order on the <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I have now held in favour of the plaintiff. I am also satisfied, for the reasons I have set out in these grounds, that the first defendant’s conduct preceding and during the pendency of this application, taken together with Mr Ong’s conduct as revealed in the Oppression Suit, warrants an order that it disclose its assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I therefore order that the first defendant now file the affidavit which its deponent swore or affirmed pursuant to its undertaking on 27 November 2019 and serve it on the plaintiff within three days of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The sealing order sought by the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The next ancillary issue which I have to deal with is the plaintiff’s application to seal certain documents in the court’s file in order to maintain the confidentiality of the settlement agreement.

</div> As the plaintiff accepts, the question of whether to seal a particular document or the court’s file as a whole entails balancing the principle of open justice against countervailing factors (<span class="font-italic">Hi-P International Ltd v Tan Chai Hau and others </span>[2020] SGHC 128 at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I decline to seal the file. I accept that the plaintiff is under a contractual obligation to keep the existence and the terms of the settlement agreement confidential.

</div>
</div> But a private obligation of confidentiality is not a basis, in and of itself, to outweigh the fundamental principle of open justice. The countervailing factor must be something more, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> a need to protect a trade secret, to protect unpublished price-sensitive information, to safeguard a vulnerable individual or to safeguard national security. In any event, the plaintiff’s obligation of confidentiality is subject to an express contractual exception allowing it to reveal the existence and the terms of the settlement agreement in order to enforce or protect its legal rights. There is thus no risk that the plaintiff will be exposed to any contractual liability if no sealing order is granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Endorsement of penal notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiff also seeks my permission to endorse a penal notice on the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction. I do not consider that the plaintiff requires my permission to endorse a penal notice on the <span class="font-italic">marev</span><span class="font-italic">a</span> injunction. As Tan Puay Boon JC held in <span class="font-italic">U</span><span class="font-italic">RU v URV</span> [2018] SGHCF 22, a party does not require the court’s permission to endorse a penal notice upon the order. Tan JC set out the policy considerations and then concluded (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having weighed the policy considerations, I am of the view that, on balance, it is preferable that litigants should not have to obtain leave for the endorsement of a penal notice on a copy of an order of court. The starting point is that those who have obtained judgments and orders in their favour are entitled to see that such orders are complied with, and those who are subject of such orders ought to recognise the seriousness of such orders, and the possibility of facing adverse consequences if they do not obey them. Seen in this light, it must be asked why a party should have to obtain the court’s prior approval before informing the person subject to the order that if he does not comply, he may be compelled to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Tan JC adds three subsidiary points to this general principle. First, it is of course open to a party to ask the court to insert a penal notice in an order and for the court to accede to that request. A penal order of this nature emanates from the court. But it carries no additional penal or procedural consequences as compared to a penal notice endorsed by a party without the court’s permission. Second, a party who endorses a penal notice on an order of court without the court’s permission should not draft it or endorse it in such a manner as to suggest misleadingly that it emanates from the court (<span class="font-italic">URU v URV</span> at [25(b)]. Second, there are certain classes of orders which are, by their very nature, so harsh that endorsing a penal notice upon the order will be oppressive (<span class="font-italic">URU v URV</span> at [37]). The example of the latter which Tan JC gives, citing <span class="font-italic">Robert Arnold Tuohy and others v Gary Bell (As Trustee in Bankruptcy of the Appellant</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 423 at [59] is an order for possession of a defendant’s home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Tan JC arrived at his decision on a construction of Rule 696 of the Family Justice Rules (S 813/2014). I accept, however, that his analysis applies with equal force to O 45 r 7 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137  Although a <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction is an exceptionally harsh order, I do not consider that leave is required before endorsing a penal notice on <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injections as a class. Endorsing a penal notice on a <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction could be said to be necessary to advance the intended purpose of the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction, which is to prevent a dissipation of assets upon pain of contempt of court. In that sense, a penal notice operates as a service to the defendant rather than oppressing the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The plaintiff is at liberty to endorse a penal notice on the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> inunction in the usual way without my permission. I therefore make no order on the request for leave. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Attached at Annex A to this judgment is the <span class="font-italic">mareva</span> injunction which I pronounce today restraining the first defendant from disposing of its assets in Singapore up to the limit of $2,693,143.32 subject to the terms and provisos set out in it. With this injunction granted today, the first defendant is released from its undertaking to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> pending the final resolution of this application. The release is, of course, without prejudice to the consequences to the first defendant and its officers for any breaches of the undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The injunction reserves the costs of this application to be determined separately.
