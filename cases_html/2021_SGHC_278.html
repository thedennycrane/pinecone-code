Naturally, they disagree on whose fault this was, but I will only set out their precise complaints later in my judgment. At this juncture, it is sufficient to note that the parties were unhappy – both in respect of some of the same issues which led to the termination of the 2014 DA, as well as new ones – and that the Plaintiff was the one to take the first step to bring their contractual relationship to an end. It did so by invoking cl 7.2 of the 2016 DA which states that parties may terminate the contract “with six (6) months’ notice to the end of a calendar month”.

No further oral replies were heard. Having considered these submissions and the evidence put before me, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for the principal sum of €1,526,224.76 in full and its claim for contractual interest in part. I allow the counterclaim in part, and order that the Plaintiff pay the Defendant ₩1,969,018,000 with judgment interest of 5.33% from the date of the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018. I also find that the requirements for set off have been satisfied, and I will explain how the set off is to be applied from [236] to [240] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I will now detail the reasons for my decision, starting with a summary of the parties’ cases in the claim and counterclaim. Thereafter, I will set out the facts of the case, and where relevant, resolve the key factual matters in dispute. Finally, I will draw together my factual findings in relation to the issues arising from the parties’ cases. I have chosen to structure my judgment in this manner for two reasons. First, there are a substantial number of facts in dispute, and the significance (or lack thereof) of these disputed facts are best understood through the lens of the parties’ cases. Second, the parties have framed their cases around numerous alternatives. It is therefore preferable to have a working set of facts before I address each of those alternatives.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Plaintiff’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff’s case in the claim is straightforward.

It could have, in my view, been more simply pleaded. This is not aided by the Plaintiff’s many – bordering on excessive – alternative defences. Nevertheless, if distilled, the Defendant’s counterclaim can be understood as following two relatively straightforward steps. First, that the Plaintiff’s termination of the 2016 DA on 25 October 2016, was legally invalid. Second, that the Plaintiff breached several of its obligations under the 2016 DA, thus giving the Defendant a claim for damages suffered in the form of lost profits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First step: Validity of the Plaintiff’s termination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice was not legally valid, and thus did not have the effect of triggering the termination of the 2016 DA on 25 October 2016.

Before I go on to describe the second step of the case in the counterclaim, however, it is useful to explain why such emphasis was placed on the validity of the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Interjection: Significance of the Plaintiff’s termination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 If the Defendant is successful in establishing either of the arguments set out at [16] above, the consequence would be my finding that the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice had no legal effect.

This is because, if the notice <span class="font-italic">had been</span> issued validly, any claim the Defendant has for lost profits would be cut-off by the date on which the notice was slated to end, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 April 2017 (see [5] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The reason for this cut-off, if not immediately apparent, is quite simple. If the Plaintiff properly exercised its right of termination under cl 7.2 of the 2016 DA, it is not open for the Defendant to claim that it has lost profits on the basis that the 2016 DA “would have continued” had the Plaintiff not committed the breaches it allegedly did.

</div> This is because, whether the Plaintiff breached the 2016 DA or not, the First Termination Notice would have brought it to an end on 30 April 2017. Thus, any profits which the Defendant says it <span class="font-italic">could</span> have earned had the Plaintiff not breached the 2016 DA, it <span class="font-italic">would no longer</span> have been able to earn past this date. Put simply, the Plaintiff’s valid exercise of cl 7.2 would break any causal link between profits lost after 30 April 2017, and the Plaintiff’s alleged breaches of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The German law experts do not entirely agree as to the specific threshold of causation which the Defendant must prove.

So long as the Plaintiff’s cl 7.2 termination was valid, the point at [30] above would still stand. Applying Prof Lehmann’s view, the Defendant cannot say that it would, “in the normal course of events”, have earned profits after the date of termination. The normal course of events would simply have been the end of the 2016 DA on 30 April 2017. On Prof Grigoleit’s view, assuming that the Plaintiff breached the 2016 DA, but nevertheless validly invoked cl 7.2, the profits lost by the Defendant after 30 April 2017 would have been lost irrespective of the Plaintiff’s breach. It thus cannot be said that the profits would have accrued “without the liability event”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Plaintiff makes a similar submission on the basis of the minimum performance principle as applied in the context of distributorship agreements in <span class="font-italic">Silberline Asia Pacific Inc v Lim Yong Wah Allan</span> [2006] SGHC 27 at [12] and [13].

</div> In essence, this principle limits the recovery of damages by assessing it through the lens of what is least costly or most beneficial to the party being sued. Here, that is the Plaintiff, and its least costly method of termination would have been giving six months’ notice under cl 7.2 of the 2016 DA. This is a suitable alternative analysis to the above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, if the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice had been validly issued, the Defendant would – at most – be able to recover: (a) any profits lost on or before 30 April 2017; and (b) damages for other losses suffered (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, other than lost profits), whether before or after 30 April 2017 so long as they can be proven to have been caused by the Plaintiff’s breach(es) of contract.

In fact, counsel hold a unique position. Where they state the factual positions of parties by reference to evidence admitted or to be admitted, especially those of their own client, the court generally accepts the accuracy of such statement. The court’s trust in counsel, however, cannot be taken for granted. I therefore take this opportunity to remind counsel to take particular care in ensuring the accuracy of their statements. I would also add that there may well be circumstances in which a statement made in the lead counsel’s statement or an opening statement may have been relied upon by the other party in such a manner that it would be unjust to permit the first party to resile from it.

As such, the existence and breach of such a duty should plainly be determined by reference to the 2016 DA, which the Plaintiff accepts was an exclusive agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 From this, it is clear that, the issue of whether the parties’ agreements prior to the 2016 DA were also exclusive, is not particularly salient. Even if the Defendant proves that its relationship with the Plaintiff was exclusive before the 2016 DA, to make anything of this, it will also need to show that the Plaintiff breached the relevant pre-2016 DA agreement. Even then, this would still not be directly relevant to the actual issue stated above. It would only be indirectly relevant to the extent that it informs the Plaintiff’s motives behind its alleged refusal – in late 2016 – to assist the Defendant’s investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Indeed, this is precisely how the Defendant proposes to make use of the evidence.

</div> These exchanges are most significant as they directly concern how the Plaintiff responded to the Defendant’s request for assistance, and thus, whether it breached its contractual duty to cooperate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Whether the Plaintiff’s response is also “thoroughly unsurprising” in the light of past conduct, is entirely ancillary. References to the Plaintiff’s past conduct alone is not sufficient to show that it <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> refused to support the Defendant’s investigations in late 2016. The evidential value of the Plaintiff’s alleged past conduct is, as such, minimal. It will only be of some significance if the contemporaneous evidence is equivocal, but not so equivocal that such past conduct cannot do anything to sway the conclusion either way. For these reasons, I do not find it necessary to determine whether the 2014 DA – or the parties’ unwritten contractual relationship before the 2014 DA – were exclusive agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disputes arising during the 2014 DA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I turn next to the period following the parties’ execution of the 2014 DA in October 2014. For approximately six months thereafter, their relationship as supplier and distributor carried on smoothly. However, sometime in April 2015, one of two issues arose which would ultimately lead to the parties terminating the 2014 DA, executing the SCA (the “settlement and contribution agreement”: see [3] above), and entering into the 2016 DA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I will refer these two issues as the: (a) “Misrepresentation Issue”; and (b) “Misdescription Issue”. They relate to certain food safety concerns which arose in respect of the Haribo Group’s products. Before I set them out, however, it bears noting that – though these were issues which arose whilst the 2014 DA was still in force, and before the parties executed the SCA – they nevertheless form a part of the Defendant’s counterclaim based on the 2016 DA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Briefly, the Defendant’s case is that these issues went unresolved even after the SCA and 2016 DA were executed; that the Plaintiff remained obliged to resolve them under the 2016 DA, notwithstanding the SCA; and thus, that the Plaintiff acted in breach of the 2016 DA.

The consumer complained that a wood contaminant had been found in one packet of the Haribo Group’s products, and threatened to file a formal complaint with the South Korean authorities. Costco informed the Defendant about the complaint, and concurrently enquired about the measures the Haribo Group’s production factory had put in place to prevent such occurrences. In particular, it queried whether x-ray screenings were conducted to identify contaminants. The Defendant then conveyed this query to the Plaintiff, which in turn, extended it to the manufacturer of the Group’s products, Haribo Produktions GmbH &amp; Co KH (“Haribo Produktions”).

The parties’ relationship was, at this point, quite acrimonious and I do not ascribe any blame for that state of affairs. All I find is that the Plaintiff could not have breached its duties of cooperation under cl 3.7 or 8.9 given the absence of an issue in respect of which its cooperation was needed to solve. Correlatively, I also find that there was no breach of cl 8.8. If the Misdescription Issue was not a live one at the time the Defendant made its request for assistance, the Plaintiff’s failure to provide assistance surely cannot be construed as conduct that is “likely to destroy or seriously damage or undermine the relationship of trust and confidence”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Misrepresentation Issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 At around the same time the parties butted heads over the Misdescription Issue, grievances regarding the <span class="font-italic">Misrepresentation</span> Issue were also being aired.

In support of this, it relied on two key points. First, contrary to the Defendant’s claim (see [61] above), there was no evidence that it used the Plaintiff’s 8 April 2015 letter to assure the MFDS, South Korean businesses, and consumers, of the safety of the Haribo Group’s products.

</div> On these bases, I accept the Plaintiff’s account that the Misrepresentation Issue was not a live one in respect of which the Defendant actually required their assistance. Thus, the Plaintiff did not act in breach of cll 3.7, 8.8, and 8.9 of the 2016 DA by failing to issue a letter of correction upon request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Two further points support this finding. First, even on Prof Grigoleit’s reading of cl 3.7, the Plaintiff was only obliged “to cooperate in any way necessary <span class="font-italic">to resolve food safety issues</span>”.

</div> The necessary implication of this is that there must have been a food safety issue to resolve. The fact that a false statement was made to the Defendant is not, in my view, sufficient to give rise to such an issue. Based on the wording of cl 3.7, the Defendant would need to show that the misrepresentation caused it to <span class="font-italic">infringe</span> “food safety laws and regulations” (see [71] above). Thereupon, the Plaintiff would be obliged to provide support to ensure compliance.

</div> As such, by the time the Defendant made its request for assistance on 20 September 2016 (see [75] above), it is unclear what more assistance the Defendant required in correcting the earlier 8 April 2015 letter. It could simply have utilised these newer letters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Before moving to the next section, I should also state clearly that the reasons above apply equally to cll 8.8 and 8.9 of the 2016 DA. One, as regards cl 8.8, I do not find that the Plaintiff’s conduct was “likely to destroy or seriously damage or undermine the [parties’] relationship of trust and confidence”. If the Misrepresentation Issue was not a live one as on 20 September 2016, I cannot see how the Defendant’s trust and confidence in the Plaintiff to fulfil its obligations would have been damaged by its inaction. Two, cl 8.9 obliges the parties to “cooperate in good faith with each other in order to fulfil their obligations under … the [2016 DA]”. Clause 3.7 prescribes the more specific obligation to cooperate in good faith to ensure compliance with food safety laws and regulations. If there is no breach of cl 3.7, it follows that cl 8.9 would also not have been breached.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">New disputes: MFDS Inquiry and Parallel Imports Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is clear from the foregoing that the matters which led to the termination of the 2014 DA – namely, the Misrepresentation and Misdescription Issues – were still areas of friction between the parties. However, they alone did not cause the parties’ eventual falling out. This brings me to the three new issues which only arose during the course of the 2016 DA: the “MFDS Inquiry Issue”; the “Parallel Imports Issue”; and the “Product Delivery Issues”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The MFDS Inquiry Issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In sum, as regards the MFDS Inquiry Issue, the Defendant’s case is that early in October 2016, it learnt that the MFDS was investigating a complaint made by a South Korean customer earlier in August 2016.

</div> By this point, the Plaintiff had already issued its First Termination Notice, and seeing as how the MFDS’s Inquiry had still not been resolved, it was not in my view, unreasonable for the Plaintiff to take it upon itself to issue a letter to correct any misconceptions about the process its factories use to detect foreign substances. While the Defendant was the appointed distributor for the Haribo Group’s products in South Korea, the reputation of the Haribo brand was, ultimately, the Plaintiff’s to protect. Further, though cl 3.7 provides that it is the Defendant’s responsibility to ensure compliance with food safety requirements, it does not positively exclude the Plaintiff from taking steps in that direction. In fact, the clause obliges the Defendant to “consult the [Plaintiff] prior to any correspondence with authorities, and any public statements or communication to the press” (see [71] above). This statement, in my view, makes it difficult to construe the imposition of responsibility on the Defendant, as excluding the Plaintiff’s involvement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Before turning to the Parallel Imports Issue, however, I will explain why I do not accept the Plaintiff’s last response.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having considered the evidence, I accept the Plaintiff’s account for two reasons. One, the Defendant’s request for assistance was premised on its rather bare claim that Haribo GmbH had been supporting parallel importers. It is unclear how it made this discovery, whether there was supporting evidence, or whether its source was even reliable. Accordingly, I agree that more was required to engage the Plaintiff’s duty of cooperation. The existence of a duty of cooperation (here, under cll 8.8 and 8.9, but not cl 3.7 as that pertains only to food safety) cannot mean that the obligor must cooperate with all requests, whether grounded or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Two, as mentioned at [54] above, the Defendant avers that the Plaintiff “historically … actively courted other distributors in [South] Korea”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-4569d0dc-14eb-46a9-967b-b7012271b165" data-toggle="modal" type="button">162</button></sup>

</div>
</div> Even if this were true, it is not alone sufficient to prove that the Plaintiff refused to abide by its duty of cooperation for ulterior motives, in breach of contract. I have explained this at [55] and [56] above. For these reasons, I find that there is no evidence that the Plaintiff breached its duty of cooperation under the 2016 DA in respect of the Parallel Imports Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The Product Delivery Issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I turn finally, to the Product Delivery Issue. As stated at [17(b)] above, the Defendant’s case is that, in response to its requests for assistance for the above-discussed issues, the Plaintiff deliberately halted product deliveries and cancelled production of goods it had ordered. In particular, the Defendant avers that its orders for the months of June to December 2016 (the “Orders”) went entirely unfulfilled, or, if they were partially fulfilled, that they were delayed (the “Undelivered Portions”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This brings me then to section 307(1). The Defendant’s argument is that condition 2 fails the requirements of clarity and comprehensibility. Specifically, such failure stems from fact that the condition empowers the Plaintiff to: (a) take an indefinite period of time to issue a written confirmation; and (b) vary descriptions and images of products, even after written confirmation has been issued. This, the Defendant says, is not tolerable because it is left “hanging on potentially indefinitely”.

In this regard, I accept Prof Lehmann’s view that condition 2 should be read with cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA (text at [94] above). The latter obliges the Plaintiff to use reasonable best endeavours to deliver goods in a timely manner in accordance with the sales reports produced by the Defendant. The result of this, Prof Lehmann states, is that the Plaintiff “does not reserve to itself the right to unreasonably long or insufficiently specific periods of time for acceptance or rejection of an offer or for rending performance”.

The Orders can be sub-grouped into those placed in July to October 2016, and those placed in November and December 2016. In respect of the orders from July to October 2016, the Plaintiff accepts that when the Defendant placed its orders, <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices were issued.

</div> Its position, however, is that such invoices do not amount to written confirmation of the Defendant’s orders. Rather, they merely acknowledge receipt of the order, prior to the Plaintiff’s internal checks as to what can be produced and delivered.

Condition 2 states that “written confirmation” is required, but does not specify a particular form such confirmation must take. It is perfectly possible for written confirmation to take the form of the <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoice. If the Plaintiff merely wanted to acknowledge but not confirm the Defendant’s order, it could have done so by saying as much. There was no need to issue an invoice in the manner it did. As an aside, I note that the literal meaning of “<span class="font-italic">pro forma</span>” – “for the sake of form” – may appear to support the Plaintiff’s position. However, I do not think much of this label. The parties were free to title their documents with anything they wished.

</div> If the invoice is not a confirmation of the order, it is odd that it sets out instructions to pay. On the Plaintiff’s case, this line would not only be meaningless, but it might also lead the Defendant to pay when it is not obliged to. Suppose the Plaintiff is correct, and that the Defendant places an order on 14 July 2016. It receives a <span class="font-italic">pro forma invoice</span> and on 3 August, it proceeds to make payment. At this point, the Plaintiff has not given what it considers “written confirmation”, and it ultimately decides not to give such confirmation. If so, it then needs to return the sum paid. This begs the question, why ask the Defendant to make such payment in the first place? This is commercially illogical, and it supports the conclusion that a <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoice must have been the Plaintiff’s written confirmation of an order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Two, in an email from Mr Karpuzov on 23 January 2017, he states, “Please note that we have issued [<span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices] for all the orders until order 2016-TEN#4 and <span class="font-italic">we will deliver all the ordered quantities</span>”.

</div> I do not accept this characterisation in light of Mr Karpuzov’s 23 January 2017 email (see [106] above). There, Mr Karpuzov draws a connection between the issuance of <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices and the delivery of ordered quantities. This suggests that the Plaintiff viewed such invoices as the “written confirmation” required for the purposes of condition 2. Thus, when he asked in December 2016 why the Defendant wanted <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices when they were no longer needed, there seems only to be two possible ways to interpret his statement. One, that <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices were no longer needed and, in any case, that the Defendant’s orders were not confirmed. Or two, that the <span class="font-italic">pro forma </span>invoices were no longer needed, and the Defendant need not ask for them because their orders had, in any case, been confirmed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In my view, the second interpretation of Mr Karpuzov’s email is more natural. If he wished specifically to state that the Defendant’s orders had not been confirmed, one would expect him to have stated so. By merely asking why the Defendant needed <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices, it seems implied that the orders had been confirmed save without said invoices. The fine distinction which the Plaintiff draws between an “acknowledged” order and a “confirmed” order, in my view, does not hold in this context. On this basis, I find that the Orders for November and December 2016 had also been confirmed, that a binding contract had arisen, and that the Plaintiff was obliged to deliver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Having found that the Plaintiff was obliged to deliver the Orders, I need then to consider the Plaintiff’s defences to its late and non-deliveries. Before I do so, however, I note as an aside, that the Defendant sought to rely on a doctrine in German law called “eloquent silence” in respect of Mr Karpuzov’s lack of a reply to the Defendant’s 20 December 2016 email (see [108] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 For the following reasons, I find that none of these defences apply. As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the burden of proof to establish these defences lies on the Plaintiff. It is not for the Defendant to disprove them. Even though the parties’ agreement is governed by German law, it is trite that matters of procedure are governed by the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Star City Pty Ltd (fka Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Ltd) v Tan Hong Woon</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 306 at [8] to [14]). It is plain that rules of evidence are matters of procedure, as such, given that the Plaintiff asserts the facts underlying its defences, it bears the burden of proving those facts (s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed); <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank </span><span class="font-italic">BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale</span>”) [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">Sufficient Stock Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The essence of the Sufficient Stock Defence is that the Defendant had enough inventory to last it until 30 April 2017, and it had no justification for placing more orders which it would not have been able to sell before the end of the 2016 DA. On this basis, the Plaintiff claims it was under no obligation to fulfil the Orders. To make out this defence, the Plaintiff needs to show that the Defendant <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> had sufficient stock, and that, <span class="font-italic">under German law</span>, it had the legal right to withhold deliveries on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Plaintiff’s submissions were focused on the latter.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, it made two key points. One, that the extent of its obligation under cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA was only to ensure that deliveries were made in accordance with the timelines set out in the Defendant’s sales report, or as the parties mutually agreed. It was not to make any and all deliveries at a time requested by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Two, that in determining the scope of the Plaintiff’s obligation under cl 9.3, the court ought to take into account: (a) the fact that the 2016 DA was coming to an end; and (b) that it is not commercially sensible to allow the Defendant to stock up on products towards the end of the 2016 DA at the expense of the Plaintiff’s interests. As regards (a), the Plaintiff suggested, more specifically, that the impending termination of the 2016 DA meant that it was <span class="font-italic">only obliged</span> to deliver products that the Defendant would have been able to sell by the date on which the contract was going to end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In my view, the second point is flawed. Commercially, principals and distributors are in business for themselves. The former earns from sales to the latter, and the latter earns from sales to wholesalers and retailers. It is therefore strange for the Plaintiff to argue that it was not commercially sensible for it to sell to the Defendant, the stock it wished to purchase, because the 2016 DA was coming to an end. Whether the Defendant would have been able complete its sales is its own concern. So long as the Plaintiff fulfils its end of the transaction, it is entitled to payment on the goods delivered. If the Defendant is unable thereafter to complete sales before the end of the 2016 DA, it would no longer be entitled to sell the goods pursuant to cl 7.7, and the Plaintiff would not even be obliged to repurchase the balance goods as cl 5.2 provides. Further, if the Defendant attempted to sell its products after the 2016 DA had ended, injunctive relief could be sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 For context, cll 5.2 and 7.7 provide:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">§ 5  Inventory Holding</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.2  <span class="font-italic">At the end of this Agreement, the </span><span class="font-italic">[Plaintiff’s] </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall be entitled, but not obliged</span><span class="font-italic">, to take back unsold Products from the </span><span class="font-italic">[Defendant] at the respective prices charged</span>, but with a maximum of the current market value, together with all reasonable logistical and warehousing costs incurred (properly documented) by the [Defendant] in relation to the unsold Products, whereby the relevant Products must have an outstanding shelf life of at least 12 weeks (best before date).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">§ 7 Duration and Termination of the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.7  After the termination of the Agreement the [Defendant] shall no longer act as [Plaintiff’s] Distributor in the Territory.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I am bolstered in my view by Mr Karpuzov’s own evidence that, after the 2016 DA actually ended, it had “1.2 million products for [the Defendant]”

</div>
</div> As I mentioned at [37] above, in December 2016 and January 2017, the Defendant issued notices under cl 7.5 of the 2016 DA, demanding that the Plaintiff make deliveries on some of the Orders. It was only after the Plaintiff failed to do so that the Defendant issued its own Termination Notice on 3 February 2017. Accordingly, if the Plaintiff had simply acted on the demands for delivery, it would not have needed to sit on goods tailor-made for the South Korean market which had not been spoken for. It could have passed on the burden of finding customers to the Defendant. It was by their failure to deliver, that they took on that onus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I therefore do not think these points support the Plaintiff’s position that cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA should be construed as conferring on it the right to withhold delivery from the Defendant. Such an interpretation is neither commercially sensible for the Plaintiff, nor the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In support of the Plaintiff’s position, Prof Lehmann cites a case heard by the <span class="font-italic">Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main</span> (the Court of Appeal of Frankfurt) which he says decided that “where a distribution contract is coming to an end, the principal is ‘at the most’ obliged to deliver products that can be sold until this moment”.

</div> This may well have been the court’s view. However, German cases do not create binding precedent, and without an accompanying provision of the BGB which suggests this rule, or at least a closer analysis of the court’s reasons for its conclusion – which Prof Lehmann does not provide – I do not accept this as being an appropriate way to construe cl 9.3. Indeed, there is nothing about the text of cl 9.3 which suggests that the Plaintiff’s obligation should be relieved in this manner. The ordinary principles of interpretation in German law can simply be applied, and I will turn to them momentarily, after I address a point of expert evidence raised by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In its written reply submissions, the Plaintiff argues that, since Prof Grigoleit has not contested the above-mentioned Frankfurt Court of Appeal case, this point of undisputed German law “<span class="font-italic">must</span> be accepted by this Court”.

Although the court ought not to substitute its own view for that of an uncontradicted expert, it is entitled to scrutinise the premises adopted by and analytical reasoning of the expert. Here, Prof Lehmann’s view that the Plaintiff was, “at the most”, obliged to deliver goods which the Defendant would have been able to sell by the end of the 2016 DA, stands on rather shaky ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 His report does not set out the reasoning of the Frankfurt Court of Appeal; whether it stated its decision to be a general rule thereafter applicable to all distribution contracts; the specific words of the principal’s delivery obligations in that case, or even what the facts of that case were.

To explain this, I can do no better than quote Evans LJ in <span class="font-italic">MCC Proceeds Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc</span> [1999] CLC 417 at [13] (followed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 391, though this passage was not referenced there):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the answer varies according to the nature of the issue which arises in the particular case and the kind of decision which the trial judge and now the Court of Appeal is called upon to make. Sometimes the foreign law, apart from being in a foreign language, may involve principles and concepts which are unfamiliar to an English lawyer. The English judge’s training and experience in English law, therefore, can only make a limited contribution to his decision on the issue of foreign law. But the foreign law may be written in the English language; and its concepts may not be so different from English law. Then the English judge’s knowledge of the common law and of the rules of statutory construction cannot be left out of account. He is entitled and indeed bound to bring that part of his qualifications to bear on the issue which he has to decide, notwithstanding that it is an issue of foreign law. There is a legal input from him, in addition to the judicial task of assessing the weight of the evidence given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The notion that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal may have relieved principals of their contractual obligations to deliver when their distributorship agreements with their distributors are approaching an end, is not a concept beyond the grasp of this court. I can fully appreciate how this would operate. What I require from Prof Lehmann, is not his bare assertion of such a rule, but rather his proof that the court did in fact lay down such a rule. Such proof could have come in the form of an explanation as to the basis on which such rule overrides the express obligations in the parties’ contract, the rationale for the rule (especially in light of my observations at [117] above), and so on. Without this, I cannot accept that such rule applies contrary to the plain words of cl 9.3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Having addressed the Plaintiff’s argument on proof of foreign law, I now return to cl 9.3, the full text of which is set out at [94] above. Saliently, it provides that the Plaintiff “shall ensure timely delivery of the Products … in accordance with the timelines as stated in the ongoing and updated Sales Reports … or as mutually agreed upon in writing”. The latter half of this sentence can be ignored; it is not either parties’ case that they had agreed to any specific delivery dates in writing. We are only concerned with the statement in the first half of the clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 From the evidence, despite cl 9.3, it does not seem that the expected delivery dates were ever stated expressly in the sales reports. Those tendered to the court only contained difficult-to-decipher sales volumes and percentages.

</div> In cross-examination, Mr Karpuzov similarly testified that delivery timelines had never been strictly agreed upon or set out. However, he accepted that it was “a rule of thumb” for the Defendant to submit its purchase orders four months in advance of the expected delivery. Although he suggests that this timeframe was not strict, it was “more or less” followed. Further, he also accepted that the Defendant “more or less” placed orders in accordance with quantities forecasted in its sales reports.

</div> The question which arises from this, is whether the parties’ practice affects how cl 9.3 should be read.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Professor Lehmann explains that the “most important rules of interpretation for private contracts are laid down in [sections] 133 and 157 [of the] BGB. German courts must interpret the parties’ declarations in light of their intent. ‘Declarations’ are, in particular, offer and acceptance, which together amount to a contract. According to [section] 157 [of the] BGB, contracts must be interpreted in line with the requirements of good faith <span class="font-italic">and any custom existing between the parties</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This, in my view, squarely addresses how cl 9.3 should be interpreted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Defendant did not, over the course of their agreement, seem to have expressly set out the expected date of delivery in its sales reports. However, they did eventually come to an understanding that orders would be placed “more or less” four months in advance. Mr Karpuzov’s evidence shows that the Plaintiff also regarded this as customary. Accordingly, I find that cl 9.3 obliged the Plaintiff to deliver the Defendant’s confirmed orders within approximately four months from the date of the order. It was therefore obliged to deliver the Orders – which were placed from July to December 2016 – from October 2016 to April 2017 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 This obligation is a strict one – as contractual obligations are – and the Plaintiff must make <span class="font-italic">timely</span> deliveries (as prescribed by cl 9.3), bearing in mind the four-month custom. A failure to do so, subject to the Plaintiff’s other defences considered below, amounts to a breach of contract. However, an issue which arises – given the slight ambiguity in the word “timely”, coupled with the fact that the four-month timeline is described as applying “more or less” of the time – is how far off from four months would be considered “untimely”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In my view, a period of four months to the end of the month is reasonable. That is, if the Defendant placed its order sometime in August 2016, the Plaintiff would have had to make delivery by 31 December 2016. This is consistent with the custom of the parties. All seven Orders were placed around the middle of the month, with the Defendant requesting that most deliveries be made four months later, but without any particular date. For example, the Order for August 2016 was placed on the 18th that month, and the request was for it to be delivered by “December 2016”.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In sum, for the reasons above, I find that the Sufficient Stocks Defence fails, and the Plaintiff was obliged under cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA to deliver within a period of four months to the end of the month from the date on which the Order was placed. On the evidence, that means:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Orders for June and July 2016, both placed on 14 July 2016, were to be delivered by 30 November 2016;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Order for August 2016, placed on 18 August 2016, was to be delivered by 31 December 2016;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Order for September 2016, placed on 13 September 2016, was to be delivered by 31 January 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Order for October 2016, placed on 14 October 2016, was to be delivered by 28 February 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Order for November 2016, placed on 18 November 2016, was to be delivered by 31 March 2017; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Order for December 2016, placed on 19 December 2016, was to be delivered on 30 April 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 On this last delivery, I note that 30 April 2017 is the same day on which the 2016 DA would have ended <span class="font-italic">if</span> the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice was valid. However, as I have stated at [121] above, there is nothing about cl 9.3 which suggests that the Plaintiff’s obligation to deliver should be limited by the 2016 DA coming to an end. If the Defendant was willing to place and pay for an order it may not have been able to sell, and for which the Plaintiff was under no obligation to buy back, it was free to take that risk. However, liability and quantum are distinct issues. The Plaintiff could have breached its obligation to deliver by 30 April 2017 (subject to my consideration of the other defences below), but that does not necessarily mean the Defendant should be entitled to any damages if it cannot show that it would have been able to profit from this final order within the day. I will return to this at [200] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Before I turn to the next defence, I make a further observation about the Plaintiff’s case. Even if I had preferred their interpretation of cl 9.3, I was not satisfied that the Defendant <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> had sufficient stock. Two points in particular suggest this. One, the Plaintiff relies on its own stock calculations of the Defendant’s stock levels in March 2017.

</div> Apart from the Frankfurt Court of Appeal case discussed at [121] above, the Plaintiff also specifically relies on Prof Grigoleit’s “concession” that, if an order is “100 times as much” as can be expected from previous dealings, then it is “probably a fair reason” for the Plaintiff to reject an order.

In this regard, I do not think Prof Grigoleit’s “concession” meaningfully assists the Plaintiff. If the principal had not wished to accept such an order, it was free to do so upon the distributor’s offer to purchase being made. However, once it is accepted – and I have found that the Plaintiff did accept the Orders in this case (see [104] to [110] above) – the parties ought to be bound by their contractual obligations.

Saliently, I found that the Plaintiff did not breach its contractual duties of cooperation in respect of the Misdescription, Misrepresentation, MFDS Inquiry, and Parallel Imports Issues. These hooks, on which the Defendant hangs aspects of its claim for breach of contract, therefore fall away. I found, however, that the Plaintiff was obliged by cl 9.3 to deliver the seven Orders placed by the Defendant between July and December 2016; and that none of the defences it raised applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 With these facts and findings in mind, I turn to seven outstanding issues necessary for me to dispose of this suit:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether cll 7.5 and 8.7 restrict cl 7.2.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether sections 138, 226 or 242 of the BGB were breached.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the Defendant’s Termination Notice was valid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the Plaintiff’s breach of cl 9.3 is actionable. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) If so, the Plaintiff’s liability for such breach.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The proper calculation of the Plaintiff’s claim for interest.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Whether the parties’ claims can be set off against each other.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Preconditions to clause 7.2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The parties’ arguments in respect of the alleged preconditions to cl 7.2 are set from [19] and [21] to [27] above.

</div> They refer to this rule using the Latin, <span class="font-italic">falsa demonstratio non nocet</span>, which translates literally to “a false demonstration does not harm”. In other words, the falsity of the written term <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the parties’ subjective understanding does not vitiate the contractual effect of such understanding. The common law analogy would be the doctrine of mutual mistake, given effect by the equitable remedy of rectification. I cannot find, however, that this applies because there is no evidence that the parties understood cl 7.2 as limited by cl 7.5 at the point at which the 2016 DA was executed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Third, based on the wording of cl 7.5, there is no practical or logical way it can be applied in relation to cl 7.2. The former obliges the <span class="font-italic">innocent</span> party to issue a cure notice, and empowers it to terminate with immediate effect if the defaulting party fails to cure its breaches within 45 days (see text at [21] above). It is incredibly awkward to extend this to a case where the allegedly defaulting party is the one seeking to exercise cl 7.2. This further supports the conclusion that the parties could not have subjectively intended cl 7.5 to restrict cl 7.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I turn next to cl 8.7. The key issue on which the parties engaged, was whether this clause operated in connection with termination or litigation.

</div> I respectfully disagree. The second half of this statement does not follow from the first. Suppose, for example, that the Plaintiff and Defendant were <span class="font-italic">not</span> in dispute about any issue. However, the Defendant wished to bring the 2016 DA to an end to pursue other commercial ventures. If the Defendant is right about cl 8.7, it would have needed to initiate dispute resolution processes before it could serve notice of termination under cl 7.2, <span class="font-italic">even though</span> there would have been no disputes to resolve.

</div>
</div> This, in my view, is a more coherent reading of the clause as a whole. The first half of cl 8.7 (see text at [21] above) empowers and obliges specified individuals to communicate in good faith to resolve disputes which cannot be settled by the parties’ day-to-day management teams. The second half then states that <span class="font-italic">if</span> such disputes cannot be resolved within 30 days (or such other period as the parties agree in writing), their dispute may then be submitted to the Singapore High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 This is reminiscent of clauses which oblige parties to attempt mediation before commencing either litigation or arbitration (compare, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">International Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 130 at [7] and [62]). Such clauses are relatively commonplace given the general shift towards cheaper, non-adversarial means of dispute resolution. However, the reading proposed by Prof Grigoleit – which results in incongruity between the first and second half of cl 8.7 – is quite novel. Therefore, absent some evidence that the parties subjectively intended cll 7.2 and 8.7 to be applied together (cross-reference [156] above), I do not accept his view.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 For these reasons, subject to my finding as regards the Plaintiff’s alleged violation of sections 138, 226, and 242 of the BGB (in the next paragraph), the Plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">First</span> Termination Notice was valid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: Breaches of sections 138, 226 or 242 of the BGB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In light of my factual findings that the Plaintiff did not breach its duties of cooperation in respect of the Misdescription, Misrepresentation, MFDS Inquiry, and Parallel Imports Issues, I find that sections 138, 226 or 242 of the BGB are not engaged, and therefore the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice is not invalidated by the application of any of these three provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 While I have found the Plaintiff to have been in breach of cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA, this is not in my view sufficient to substantiate allegations that the Plaintiff’s conduct was either contrary to good morals, amounted to unlawful chicanery, or objectionable according to the German standards of good faith and fair dealing. I will address each in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 First, the threshold to be met for a claim of “contrary to good morals” is, expectedly, quite open-textured. However, in support of the manner in which the Defendant has developed its case, Prof Grigoleit suggests that reprehensible motives such as vengeance would suffice.

</div> Though I am content to accept that vengeance is sufficient, I do not find sufficient evidence that the Plaintiff acted for this purpose. The first key piece of evidence on which the Defendant relies in support of its claim is the End of the Road Pronouncement in response to its requests for assistance (see [146] above). However, this appears far less an internal plan to exact vengeance than an exasperated declaration that the parties could no longer continue working together, given the acrimony. In fact, having considered the exchanges between the parties, it does seem to me that their communications were far from friendly or collegiate.

</div> This exasperation can, and in my view does, explain why the Plaintiff exercised its right to terminate under cl 7.2 shortly thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The second key piece of evidence is the fact that the Plaintiff failed to complete delivery of the Orders as I have discussed from [93] to [145] above.

Accordingly, I find that this is not enough to prove that the Plaintiff acted contrary to good morals when it came to exercise its right under cl 7.2 to terminate the 2016 DA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 On the second ground, Prof Grigoleit accepts that unlawful chicanery can only be established if the Plaintiff acted for “no other purpose than causing damage to the [Defendant]”.

As such, for the same two reasons, I also dismiss this allegation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Finally, on the third ground, Prof Grigoleit suggests that a breach of “good faith and fair dealing” “may be based upon the particular requirements of <span class="font-italic">loyalty to the other party and of trust in the continuance of the exchange</span>” [emphasis added]. More than this, in fact, he submits that the standards of good faith increase even further when the court is concerned with contracts which have lasted for a long duration.

The Professor’s suggestion seems to lead to the conclusion that section 242 of the BGB operates to impose a fiduciary-like duty to bear in mind the counterparty’s interest in preserving the contract, and act in furtherance of that interest, even if it may not align with the actor’s own interests. This, in my view, goes slightly too far in the field of contract – even when we take into account notions of good faith in German law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Professor Lehmann presents a much more balanced view. He cites a case in which the principal (also under a distribution agreement) attempted to force the distributor to accept a variation to their contractual terms which would have seriously disadvantaged it. When the distributor refused to do so, the principal exercised its right of termination. The German Federal Court found that the single determinative reason for the principal’s termination was the distributor’s refusal to accept those varied terms. This, it held, was conduct which violated the standards of good faith and fair dealing.

</div> The facts of this case are quite different, and prohibits the kind of conduct which is antithetical to ordinary good faith and fair dealing. By contrast, the kind of conduct Prof Grigoleit says should be proscribed suggests that a kind of <span class="font-italic">uberrimae fidei</span> (or “utmost good faith”) is required. This is a threshold which the text of section 242 of the BGB does not seem to envision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Furthermore, the mere fact of a lengthy contractual relationship – on which Prof Grigoleit relies to bolster the Defendant’s position on the facts – is neither here nor there. He suggests that length is a relevant consideration because a distributor may have undertaken considerable expense in preparing for its role, and a baseless, arbitrary termination would result in these expenses being thrown away.

</div> This is not necessarily true. Contrary to the Professor’s view, a lengthy relationship may have allowed the distributor to turn a sizeable profit, and the costs incurred may be relatively insignificant in the grand scheme of things. On the other hand, the costs incurred in a short relationship may be proportionately far greater than the amount the distributor may have been able to earn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 For these reasons, I also find that that section 242 of the BGB was not engaged, and that the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice was not invalid on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Validity of Defendant’s Termination Notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The validity of the Defendant’s Termination Notice and opposingly, the Plaintiff’s Second Termination Notice, turns on whether the Defendant had a valid basis to terminate the 2016 DA with immediate effect on 3 February 2017. Given my finding on the Misdescription, Misrepresentation, MFDS Inquiry, and Parallel Imports Issues, the only ground on which the Defendant could have effected termination validly, was the Plaintiff’s breach of cl 9.3 in respect of the Product Delivery Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 As stated at [117] above, distribution agreements operate on the simple premise that principals supply and distributors resell. This premise, in my view, quite plainly suggests that the Plaintiff’s breach was a repudiatory breach for which the Defendant could, subject to cl 7.5, terminate the 2016 DA with cause. Afterall, the absence of deliveries breaks down the fundamental purpose of a distribution agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Prof Lehmann argues the contrary position, but his evidence relies too heavily on contingent defences and thus, does not squarely address the issue. In essence, he points to the Plaintiff’s claims that the Defendant had sufficient stock; that it was only obliged to use best reasonable efforts to make deliveries in a timely manner; and that the Defendant had ordered in excess of its sales reports. On these bases, he suggests that the Defendant had no cause to terminate the 2016 DA with immediate effect on 3 February 2017.

The clause is set out in full at [21] above, but for present purposes two portions are salient. One, the clause provides that, the party who wishes to terminate with immediate effect for cause (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Defendant) must first give written notice to the other party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff), describing the nature and scope of that party’s alleged breaches, and demanding that those breaches be remedied within 45 days.

</div> Thus, to the extent that condition 7 excludes or limits liability for intentional damage in any manner, it is invalid. In this regard, it is pertinent to highlight that the third sentence of condition 7 purports to limit the Plaintiff’s liability for intentional damages to those which are “reasonably foreseeable”. Professor Lehmann concedes that such restriction is prohibited.

</div> and I prefer it to Prof Grigoleit’s. While I appreciate that numerous German Federal Court cases may be aligned in striking down exclusion clauses for simple negligence, accepting that these decisions amount to a general rule is to accept that they override the fundamental inquiry laid down in section 307(1) of the BGB. No doubt, the cases may be useful and significant, but the starting point must be to apply the provisions of the BGB as stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In any event, applying Prof Lehmann’s approach, I find that condition 7 unreasonably disadvantages the Defendant, and therefore falls afoul of section 307(1) of the BGB. More specifically, I find that it limits an essential right of the Defendant which is inherent in the nature of the 2016 DA to such an extent that attainment of the purpose of the contract is jeopardised (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, section 307(2), sub-paragraph 2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Prof Lehmann argued the contrary on two bases. First, he contended that condition 7 only excludes intangible losses, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a loss of profits. Second, in any event, such exclusion only applies to cases of simple negligence, and does not permit exclusion of liability in respect of damage arising from intentional acts or grossly negligent conduct.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I do not agree with his first point. The plain words of condition 7 (see [182] above) clearly excludes “<span class="font-italic">all </span>claims for damages”, and reference to “lost profits” is made only to illustrate “consequential damage”. This has the effect of depriving the Defendant of recourse for all remedies, not just for lost profits. Further, even if I take Prof Lehmann’s argument at its highest, I cannot see why “intangible loss” and “lost profits” should be treated lightly when concerned with a <span class="font-italic">distributorship</span> agreement. As I have stated multiple times by this point, such agreements are fundamentally simple – the principal supplies goods, and the distributor resells them for a profit. The main loss a distributor suffers when his principal fails to abide by the terms of their agreement, <span class="font-italic">is lost profits</span>. Indeed, this is the case here. Excluding the recovery of lost profits does away with most of what an aggrieved distributor can hope to recover in the event of a breach on the part of his principal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 As regards the Professor’s second point, while I agree that condition 7 does not entirely absolve the Plaintiff of liability, I think his reliance on the fact that the Plaintiff remains liable for intentional damage and gross negligence is beside the point. The Plaintiff cannot, as a matter of law, exclude such liability in any case. It is not as though the Plaintiff benevolently chose to retain liability when it did not need to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Viewed against the background of these two points, it appears to me that excluding the Plaintiff’s liability for simple negligence does limit an essential right of the Defendant. As stated, the claims which the Defendant can feasibly make are likely to be for lost profits, and although other provisions of the BGB protect its interest in cases of intentional damage, such cases would be considerably rarer than those concerning simple negligence. This is particularly so in respect of distributorship agreements, where it is in the principal’s interest not to intentionally harm its distributor. Where a distributor suffers damage, it more likely than not arises from his principal’s inadvertent rather than deliberate conduct. Accordingly, I find that section 307(1) read with section 307(2), sub-paragraph 2 is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In light of this, there is no need for me to consider the second issue (see [180] above). I will nevertheless address it briefly. As stated at [181] above, Prof Lehmann concedes that the third sentence of condition 7 is invalid because it seeks to limit the damages recoverable for intentional breaches by imposing a requirement that such damages need to be “reasonably foreseeable”. On this basis, Prof Grigoleit, suggests that the invalidity of the second and third sentence read together, invalidates the whole condition.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 I, however, can believe Mr Hahn. Such a practice appears to me to be a sensible one. It avoids disappointing customer expectations, and also serves to maintain good relations with said customers. The purchasers, I am sure, would have appreciated knowing in advance, the quantities of goods which they could expect to be delivered. It would have been more cumbersome for them to place orders with the expectation that they would be fulfilled, only to be later notified that short or no deliveries would be made. Indeed, the annoyance of the Defendant in this very case, reflects the benefit of the Defendant’s own practice with its customers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Furthermore, the attack which the Plaintiff mounts on the Defendant’s case does not answer the more fundamental point I raise at [195] above. Namely, that it contradicts common sense for the Defendant to place and expect to pay for orders it believed it had no hope of reselling before 30 April 2017. The Plaintiff’s submissions do not have an answer to this, and I accordingly find that the Defendant suffered lost profits <span class="font-italic">as a result of</span> the former’s failure to complete its delivery obligations in a timely manner, as required by cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA. I now turn to the question of quantification.

</div> The most important question in this regard is <span class="font-italic">how much</span> of the undelivered goods the Defendant would have been able to sell by 30 April 2017.

</div> This, the Plaintiff submits, are “wildly optimistic and unsubstantiated” expectations, citing <span class="font-italic">JWR Pte Ltd v Edmond Pereira Law Corp</span><span class="font-italic">oration </span>[2020] 4 SLR 832 (“<span class="font-italic">JWR</span>”) in support of its argument that such expectations ought not to attract an award of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Before I address these arguments, I should state that the quantification of damages is to be determined by Singapore law as the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> (<span class="font-italic">Goh Suan Hee v Teo Cher Teck</span> [2010] 1 SLR 367 at [16]). Now, turning then to the Plaintiff’s arguments; my view is that <span class="font-italic">JWR</span> does not quite support its case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 In <span class="font-italic">JWR</span>, the claimant sued its lawyers, Edmond Pereira Law Corporation (“EPLC”), for negligence in respect of the way it rendered legal advice and conducted legal proceedings on its behalf. Those legal proceedings were against a one Helen Lee (“Lee”). It was the claimant’s case that Lee represented to it that she was a director of a company called Immunotec Research (S) Pte Ltd (“IRS”), which was the sole distributor of Immunotec products in Singapore. Such products were manufactured by Immunotec Incorporated (“Immunotec Inc”), a Canadian company operating in Singapore. This induced the claimant to enter a distributorship agreement with IRS, to distribute Immunotec products, in Singapore. Subsequently, Lee told the claimant that IRS’s name needed to be changed to United Yield International Pte Ltd (“UYI”), which required a new agreement to be executed. The claimant duly did so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 After some time, the claimant discovered that the representations made by Lee were false. One, IRS and UYI were distinct companies. Two, neither IRS nor UYI were the sole distributor for Immunotec products in Singapore, as there were, in fact, other distributors. Following this discovery, the claimant terminated the agreement and sued Lee and UYI a few years later. This suit was struck out and thus, the claimant brought a claim against EPLC for professional negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In the suit against EPLC, it sought to recover the losses it would have been able to recover in its suit against Lee and UYI, had EPLC not been negligent. As to quantity, it submitted a report (prepared by the claimant’s own director) which projected the market for Immunotec products. The valuation in this report varied quite substantially from the claimant’s earlier positions, and it was in any case, derived by the claimant’s own calculations. It was in this context that Aedit Abdullah J remarked that the valuations in the report “were not substantiated … [and] at the very least, wildly optimistic” (at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 This is not remotely akin to the present case, where the Defendant sought to commit itself to pay for actual orders. In <span class="font-italic">JWR</span>, the claimant put down nothing, and its valuation relied on numbers out of thin air in an attempt to justify the highest possible quantum in its claim for damages. Whereas, here, the very <span class="font-italic">fact of</span> the Defendant’s Orders suggests that it was ready and able to sell what it had purchased, and could therefore, have turned a profit. Put colloquially, it was ready to put its money where its mouth was, and this, in my view, gives the Defendant’s valuation strong ground to stand on. This is unlike the valuation in <span class="font-italic">JWR</span>, which was pure, risk-free conjecture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 From cl 5.2 of the 2016 DA, the Defendant must have known that the Plaintiff was not obliged to buy back any unsold goods, and from cl 7.7, it must also have known that once the 2016 DA ended, it no longer would have the right to sell unsold goods. At the same time, the Defendant did not need to place any particular volume of orders. If its sales were going to be low, it offends common sense to think that the Defendant would have been willing to put down money knowing it would not get any back. On this basis, rather than Ms Teo’s reliance on historical, unproven data, I accept that the Defendant would have been able to completely sell the Undelivered Portions of the Orders had they been delivered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Indeed, I extend this even to the Order for December 2016, which I have found the Plaintiff was only obliged to deliver by 30 April 2017, the last day of the 2016 DA (see [133] above). The Defendant’s Order for December 2016 indicated that it expected delivery sometime in April 2017,

This, in my view, is a sufficient basis to find – on a balance of probabilities – that the Defendant would have been able to pull off a complete sale.

</div> Having considered these submissions, I am not convinced that they tipped the balance back in favour of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 First, none of these submissions address the fundamental query I have. That is, if the Defendant’s sales were really so poor, why then would it have placed the orders it did, if it could not come remotely close to reselling them before 30 April 2017. There is no basis for me to think that the Defendant would have acted contrary to its own interests. Second, I do not place substantial weight on the decrease in sales. A consequence of my finding that the Sufficient Stock Defence is not made out (see [134] above), is that the Defendant’s lower sales in the second half of 2016 can probably be explained by the fact that they were short on stock. Third, although the Defendant lowered its sales forecasts for January to April 2017 in October 2016, it adjusted them <span class="font-italic">up</span> for the months of October to December 2016.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 I do not accept these characterisations. By relying on the expenses that the Defendant <span class="font-italic">actually</span> incurred, Ms Teo seems to be reasoning backwards. She assumes that the lack of a variation after the Defendant ceased to sell the Haribo Group’s products, means the unvaried (or lowly varied) expenses are fixed. This may be true at or below the level of the Defendant’s sales operations in 2017 and 2018. However, the opposite conclusion, that these administrative expenses would have remained fixed had the Defendant’s business expanded to complete sales of the Undelivered Portions of the Orders, does not follow. Put simply, Ms Teo’s analysis treats such expenses as a ceiling when they could have been a floor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 In this regard, I prefer Mr Nicholson’s view that it is not realistic for the Defendant to assume that these administrative expenses would have remained unchanged despite the proposed increase in sales.

</div> Accordingly, without a granular analysis of why each expense would not have increased – which neither the Defendant nor Ms Teo offers – I find that all the administrative expenses (save for “severance pay” and “overseas payment fees”, which I will turn to in a moment) ought to be scaled with the Defendant’s increase in sales.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I turn next to the question of “severance pay”. The issue which arises in respect of this head of expense – which appears in the Defendant’s accounts – is straightforward. In essence, the Plaintiff contends that this expense, like the rest of the Defendant’s administrative expenses, should scale with its sales.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 On this, Mr Nicholson suggests that severance pay varies with the number of people the Defendant hires,

</div> and in my view, the number of people it hires varies with its volume of sales. The more the Defendant sells, the more people it will need to engage. This seems axiomatic unless some other explanation, such as the automation of the Defendant’s processes, exists. There is no such explanation, but the Defendant nevertheless contends that severance pay is an extraordinary expense which may or may not be incurred in a given year.

I would not think otherwise. Although the Plaintiff’s claim arises in debt and the Defendant’s in damages, they are both contractual in nature. The Professor does, however, suggest that section 388 is not satisfied on the grounds that the Defendant’s declaration of set off “did not specify the counterclaim … with sufficient precision”.

</div> the Defendant expressly stated that it would be setting off its debt with its claim for breach of contract. In fact, in the second of these letters, the Defendant specifically writes that it is “quantifying the full estimate of [its] losses and damages”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 In my view, this is a sufficient declaration of set-off. It cannot be that a party must present its precise calculations of loss and damages simply to trigger the right to set off, which is what Prof Lehmann suggests is required.

</div> This is a rather extreme view, given that he accepts – as a matter of German law – that an explicit declaration is not necessarily required. A set off, he says, can “follow from the circumstances”.

</div> If an explicit declaration is not even needed, it follows, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, one given explicitly need not be so specific as to disclose the particulars of the cause of action that will be brought, and the quantification of the relief to be sought. Certainly, it is difficult to imagine how such specificity would feature in an implicit declaration. In this respect, I find Prof Grigoleit’s evidence as to the state of German law, more convincing;

</div> These objections only stand if I did not find against the Plaintiff on these matters. Specifically, that the Defendant did in fact suffer damage and that such loss was caused by the Plaintiff (at [196] above); and that appendix 2, condition 7 of the 2016 DA is not invalidated by section 307 of the BGB (at [189] above). However, given my findings, these objections peter out. Indeed, the Professor accepts that, if these requirements are met, “the [Defendant’s] declaration of set off results in the extinction of the Plaintiff’s payment claim … [and] the Defendant would thus not be obliged to make the respective payments”.

</div> Accordingly, I find that the Defendant is entitled to set off the Plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 It will be observed that my analysis does not address two issues which were raised by the parties. First, whether the SCA settled the Misdescription, Misrepresentation, MFDS Inquiry, and Parallel Imports Issues (see [39], [58] and [59] above). Given my findings that the Plaintiff did not commit breaches in respect of these issues, the point was moot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Second, the manner in which the issues surrounding the quantification of the Defendant’s lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017 should be resolved. In light of my firm finding that the Plaintiff’s First Termination Notice was valid (see [154] to [171] above), there was no need for me to consider these issues. The Defendant was simply not entitled to damages after this date because, causally, any losses of profit it suffered thereafter, could not be attributable to a breach of contract on the part of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion, orders, and observations on set off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 The Plaintiff had prayed for contractual interest to apply until the date of payment, but I think that it is just, on the facts of this case, to terminate the contractual interest at an earlier date for the following reasons. First, the contractual interest rate of 15.12% is rather high, and in the context of the present-day interest rate environment, it behoves this court to be cautious in making any such award. Second, I have found that the Defendant is entitled to a counterclaim that is of a similar order of magnitude to the Plaintiff’s claim. After setting off the counterclaim, the sum for which the Defendant is indebted to the Plaintiff would be greatly diminished. In these circumstances, I am minded to exercise the discretion vested in me under s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) to order the Defendant to pay the contractual interest rate on the Plaintiff’s claims up to 30 August 2018, the date of filing of the Defence and Counterclaim, with interest thereafter to run at 5.33%. I also order interest at 5.33% on the sum ordered under the Counterclaim to run from the same date, 30 August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 For the foregoing reasons, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for the principal sum of €1,526,224.76 and its claim for contractual interest of 8% over the base BGB-prescribed interest rate of 7.12% (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15.12%) for the following sums from the following dates: (a) €1,390,464.86 with interest payable from 4 February 2017 until the date of the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018; and (b) €135,759.90 with interest payable from 4 March 2017, also until the date of the counterclaim. In respect of (a), there are 573 days between 4 February 2017 and 30 August 2018, both dates inclusive. As such, interest amounts to €330,045.31. For (b), there are 545 days and interest payable amounts to €30,649.75.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Thereafter, from the day after the counterclaim, 31 August 2018, to the date of this judgment, 2 December 2021, I order that the Plaintiff shall only be entitled to interest at the usual rate of 5.33% on the full principal sum of €1,526,224.76, as provided for in para 77(9) of the Practice Directions. There are 1190 days in this period (this takes into account the Leap Day in 2020), and interest amounts to €265,216.05. Thus, in total, <span class="font-italic">as of the date of this judgment</span>, the Plaintiff is awarded the sum of €2,152,135.87. I will denote this sum (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 On the other end, I allow the counterclaim in part, and find the Plaintiff liable to pay the Defendant ₩1,969,018,000 with judgment interest of 5.33% from the date of the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018, until the date of this judgment. There are 1190 days in this period, and the Defendant is therefore entitled to ₩342,161,383 in interest. The total award to the Defendant under the Counterclaim is, therefore, ₩2,311,179,383 (which is roughly €1.7 million). I will denote this sum (<span class="font-italic">D</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 With sums (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">D</span>) in mind, I turn then to the issue of set off involving a complication concerning currency exchange rates. The starting point is that I order that the parties determine the applicable exchange rate and set off their respective judgment debts on the <span class="font-italic">date of this judgment</span>. That is, (<span class="font-italic">D</span>) should be converted to Euro based on the exchange rate on 2 December 2021 and deducted from (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span>). As such, as of this date, the Defendant would only owe the Plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span> – <span class="font-italic">D</span>), a sum in Euro, which I will denote (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">2</span>). Thereafter, the Plaintiff would only be entitled to 5.33% interest on (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">2</span>) – as opposed to (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span>) – from the day after this judgment, 3 December 2021, to the date of full payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 As is apparent, (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">1</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">D</span>) are sums expressed in different currencies. The question which calls for an answer in respect of this complication, is whether the date of judgment – as I have decided – is an appropriate date for the Defendant’s smaller judgment debt to be converted to Euros and set off against the Plaintiff’s larger judgment debt. The crux of the problem which arises in cases like these, where parties have crossclaims for different currencies, is that the underlying value of the plaintiff’s claim fluctuates as against the defendant’s counterclaim or set off, and vice-versa. As Charles Proctor, <span class="font-italic">Mann on the Legal Aspects of Money</span> (OUP, 7th Ed, 2012) explains, “the date with reference to which the set-off is effected can, of course, have a significant impact on the amount payable, because exchange rates between the relevant currencies may have fluctuated between the date on which the respective liabilities were incurred” (at para 8.20).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 This is not likely to be a particularly difficult problem to resolve on the facts of most cases. Indeed, in the present case, the date of judgment seems to be the only viable choice because the Defendant’s counterclaim only succeeds for a sum lower than the Plaintiff’s claim (barring any sudden, wild variations in the exchange rate between the Euro and South Korean Won). The lower sum must clearly be set off against the larger sum, and so, given that the Defendant’s counterclaim for <span class="font-italic">damages</span> only accrues on the date of this judgment, the earliest a set off can be applied is this date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 That said, as there seem to be no local cases which have dealt with this issue, I will endeavour to set out some of the relevant principles for determining the date of set off in cases involving crossclaims for different currencies. I do so by answering three questions which arise from my decision in <span class="font-italic">this</span> case: (a) why I applied the date of judgment; (b) why not a later date; and (c) why not an earlier date. Questions (a) and (b) can be addressed together. A later date <span class="font-italic">could</span> possibly be fixed, but – absent a good reason for postponing set off – I would suggest, as a matter of principle, that this should not be done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 The very function of a set off is, <span class="font-italic">procedurally</span>, to extinguish a debt or claim for damages fully or partially. Though the underlying value of set off is derived from a contractual or equitable right, the right to set off as a feature in the litigation process <span class="font-italic">itself</span> has independent value because – if successfully invoked – it enables the judgment debtor to absolve or reduce his liability <span class="font-italic">notionally</span> rather than actually. In other words, there need not be a real exchange for the claim against him to be offset. A notional exchange is not always desirable or possible, and this is why, for a set off to be successfully invoked, requirements beyond the basic counter cause of action need be established. As can be seen from [230], this is also the case in German law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 The salient question which arises then is how the Defendant may most effectively realise the <span class="font-italic">procedural</span> value gained from successfully establishing set off. Given that it is fairly typical for the courts to award post-judgment interest, my view is that the best way to do so, would be to apply the set off <span class="font-italic">as soon as the right </span><span class="font-italic">(to set off) arises</span>. In cases like the present, where the party who pleads set off makes a claim for damages to be assessed, this would be the date of the judgment in which the entitlement to damages is determined. If the set off is delayed, the overall judgment debtor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the party with the smaller successful claim) unnecessarily continues incurring post-judgment interest on a principal sum larger than his own judgment debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Since the right to set off is a notional one which requires no time to execute or enforce, there is no reason for its application to be delayed. Indeed, not only is there no reason to do so, doing so is antithetical to the function of a set off as I have just explained, and also does not accord with its nature as a <span class="font-italic">defence</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Stooke v Taylor</span> (1880) 5 QBD 569 at 577 and <span class="font-italic">Gathercole v Smith</span> (1881) 7 QBD 626 at 628). A defence operates to shield a defendant from liability upon being found to be applicable. It is therefore unprincipled to forcefully hold such shield down upon the conclusion of proceedings, unless, as stated, there are good reasons for doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 I turn then to question (c) – why should the conversion and set off not be applied earlier? The answer is again, is that there must be a good justification, which may not be easy to find. For this, I turn to the case of <span class="font-italic">Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</span> [1976] AC 443 (“<span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span>”). Most will be familiar with this case, so I can set out what it decided quite simply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 The court was faced with a claim for a sum expressed in a foreign currency (but no issue of set off), and it ultimately decided to do away with the “breach-date rule”. Originally, where a claim in contract was made for a sum of foreign currency, pursuant to the line of authorities following <span class="font-italic">Di Ferdinando v Simon, Smits &amp; Co</span> [1920] 3 KB 409, the breach-date rule provided that the sum had to be converted – before judgment was entered – to the local Pound sterling. The rate of conversion was taken to be that either on the date on which: (a) the debt was payable; (b) the relevant breach of contract occurred; or (c) the damage being claimed was suffered, whichever was applicable. By its decision in <span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span>, the House of Lords allowed judgments to be entered for a sum expressed in a foreign currency, and only where it was necessary to execute the judgment in England, would that currency be converted to Pound sterling <span class="font-italic">on the date which execution is authorised</span> (at 497H to 498A).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 In <span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial Society (Pte) Ltd v Ebrahim </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 667 (“<span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial</span>”), Michael Hwang JC confirmed that the Lords’ decision had been applied by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tatung Electronics (S) Pte Ltd v Binatone International Ltd </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 231 (see <span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial</span> at [10] and [16]) and was therefore binding on him. He then went on to determine that <span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span> could not be applied in reverse. That is, if a claimant prays for relief in a foreign currency, he cannot then: (a) elect for it to be entered in the local currency of the court if the foreign currency depreciates against that local currency; nor can he (b) ask for the conversion (for the purposes of execution) to be calculated based on the rate of exchange on any date other than the date on which execution is authorised (see [19] to [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Whilst reasoning why the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial</span> should not have the right to elect, Hwang JC cites two passages by Lords Wilberforce and Fraser respectively (at [35(d)] to [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Quite apart from authority, I believe that there should be no right of election open to the plaintiff for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The short answer to what the plaintiff seeks to do in this case is to be found in <span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span> itself. Once the breach-date rule was abandoned, an alternative date for conversion of the foreign currency into the local currency had to be found. Lord Wilberforce said (at 468) that the choice: </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">is between (i) the date of action brought, (ii) the date of judgment, (iii) the date of payment [meaning the date on which the court authorised execution].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 He went on to say (at 469) that of these, the date of payment undoubtedly “gets nearest to securing to the creditor exactly what he bargained for”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 Lord Fraser put the matter thus (at 502):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any conversion date earlier than the date of payment would, in my opinion, be open to the same objection as the breach date, viz that it would necessarily leave a considerable interval of time between the conversion date and the date of payment. During that interval currency fluctuations might cause the sterling award to vary appreciably from the sum in foreign currency to which the creditor was entitled. In my opinion, it would not be justifiable to disturb the existing rule of taking the breach date, merely to substitute for it some other date rather nearer to the date of payment but still more or less distant from it. If the date of raising an action in this country were taken for conversion, a period of a year or more might easily elapse, allowing for appeals, before payment was made. The date of judgment would be better but there seems no reason why one should stop short of the latest practicable date, which seems to be the date when the court authorizes enforcement of the  judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In essence, Lords Wilberforce and Fraser seem to be saying that, if the rate of exchange is applied immediately before the payment, the effect would be that the winning party gets exactly what he bargained for, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a stated quantum, paid in the currency of his claim. As Lord Wilberforce said elsewhere in <span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span>, “[t]he creditor has no concern with pounds sterling; for him what matters is that a Swiss franc for good or ill should remain a Swiss franc” (at 466). This, in my view, is sound. The more time there is between the date of conversion and the date of payment, the more time there is for the exchange rate to fluctuate. For example, suppose P succeeds in obtaining judgment against D for US$1 million in Singapore, and on the date of the judgment, the exchange rate is US$1 is to S$1.35. Applying the conversation rate on this date would render D liable for a sum “locked in” at S$1.35 million. Suppose then by the date of payment, the rate increases to US$1 is to S$1.4. By this time, D’s payment of S$1.35 million does not satisfy a debt of US$1 million, and so P turns up short. Conversely, if the Singapore dollar had instead appreciated against the US dollar, D would then be obliged to pay more than he owes. Neither situation is desirable and can be avoided, as the Lords suggest, by carrying out conversion on or as close as possible to the date on which payment is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 How then does the Lords’ reasoning apply to a case involving set off? Given that set off is, as I have suggested at [244] above, a kind of notional payment, the conversion should be effected as close to the date of “payment” as possible, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of set off. Ideally, they should both be carried out on the same day. Consequently, if the set off cannot be effected before the date of judgment, there would likely be no convincing justification for the conversion to be backdated either. This is particularly true in cases such as the present one, where the right to set off is premised on a claim for <span class="font-italic">damages</span>. An entitlement to damages is determined by the court, and thus, can only be said to accrue upon decision (also see [242] above). So, it would be difficult to argue, in such a case, that the conversion and set off should be applied even before the entitlement is determined as a matter of fact. As Deputy Judge George Leggatt QC in <span class="font-italic">Fearns </span><span class="font-italic">(trading as Autopaint International) v Anglo-Dutch Paint &amp; Chemical Co Ltd </span>[2011] 1 WLR 366 (“<span class="font-italic">Fearns</span>”) notes (at [39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ordinarily the date at which a set-off ordered by the court will be effected will be the date of the order. No doubt the court has power to order the set-off to be effected at an earlier or later date. <span class="font-italic">I cannot, however, see justification for back-dating the set-off to any earlier date than the earliest date at which a set-off would have been possible</span>, that is when the existence and amount of the two liabilities was finally determined by judgment or agreement. Equally, <span class="font-italic">if the amount of one or both liabilities has not yet been finally determined at the date when the order is made, the date of the set-off should be the date on which that determination takes place</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 In <span class="font-italic">Fearns</span>, the claimant sought to recover damages for trademark infringement and passing off. On the other end, the defendants claimed a debt owed for certain goods which had been delivered. The debt arose sometime in 2005 and the suit concluded in 2010, whereupon the claim for damages was allowed. The difficulty, however, was that the exchange rate of the Pound to the Euro varied quite significantly from 2005 to 2010. In 2005, the rate was £1 is to €1.45, and by 2010, the Pound fell to £1 is to €1.20. The consequence of this difference was that, if the 2005 rate was adopted, the defendants would owe the claimant around £36,000 after their respective claims were set off; and if the 2010 rate was adopted, the claimant would owe the defendants around €68,000. Naturally, the claimant (who was British), argued that the set off should be effected using the 2005 exchange rate while the defendant argued the opposite.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 The court, applying the principles quoted two paragraphs above, concluded that the defendants’ liability was only determined in 2010 and so the set off should be applied then. In coming to this conclusion, it also gave the following procedural guidance, which is useful in the present case (at [50(5)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The approach which the court should adopt when ordering such a set-off between amounts payable in different currencies is: (i) to assess and add to each principal amount any interest accruing up to the date of the set-off; (ii) to convert the smaller amount into the currency of the larger amount at the exchange rate prevailing at that date; and (iii) to order payment of the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is the approach I have applied (see [240] above), and even if I had not had the benefit of considering <span class="font-italic">Fearns</span>, I would still have reached the same conclusion. It accords most closely with common sense and what parties should be entitled to recover in the face of a successful opposing claim. I would simply add that payment of the balance sum owing would be in the currency claimed by the overall judgment creditor, and where he seeks to enforce payment of that balance, the process in <span class="font-italic">Miliangos</span> should be applied accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 It is for these reasons that I held (at [240]) that the parties set off their claims on the date of this judgment, and consequently, that the Plaintiff is only entitled to receive 5.33% interest on (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">2</span>) from the day after this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chou Sean Yu, Oh Sheng Loong Frank, Daniel Lee Wai Yong, and Eve Dana Ng Shi Ying (WongPartnership LLP) for the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gregory Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Kevin Tan, Devathas Satianathan, Low Weng Hong, and Ng Shu Wen (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
