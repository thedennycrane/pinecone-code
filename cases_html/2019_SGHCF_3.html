Interim Judgment was granted on the Defendant’s amended counterclaim on 31 March 2016. The ground was the unreasonable behaviour of the Plaintiff.

I will deal with the issues raised in the Appeal by the Plaintiff at [8] above under the respective steps in that approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Division in long single-income marriages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 To divide the matrimonial assets, the DJ had applied the structured approach referred to in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”), <span class="font-italic">ie</span> to obtain the average contribution of parties after considering their direct and indirect contributions and assigning proper weightages to these contributions. She also applied the “broad brush” approach that decided cases preferred (GD, at [2]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 After the DJ’s decision was delivered on 29 November 2016, the Court of Appeal handed down on 3 March 2017 its decision in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”), a case which involved a 35-year marriage where the husband supported the family economically while the wife looked after the household. The court recognised that the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK</span> approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse” (at [44]), and “should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be applied to Single-Income Marriages”. The court further expressed the view that it was in general agreement with the approach of tending towards equal distribution of matrimonial assets in “<span class="font-italic">long </span>Single-Income Marriages” (at [48] and [54]), and upheld the decision of the High Court to order a 50:50 division of the matrimonial assets in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As the Defendant did not work throughout the marriage, I therefore treat it as a single-income marriage. In the light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK,</span> it becomes necessary to review the results of the approach used by the DJ (which is more appropriate for dual income marriages) to see if a fair and equitable decision has been arrived at.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The DJ had also divided the matrimonial flat separately from the rest of the matrimonial assets, and after considering parties’ contributions in relation to each class, arrived at percentages for division for them which were very similar (GD, at [6] and [7]). This is the classification methodology described in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> at [32]. I do not think this method is necessary for this case, as the respective contributions of parties are not so different for the various assets in each of the two classes. No one asset was acquired through the exceptional efforts of one of the parties, but were all slowly built up over time. The global assessment methodology would have sufficed. Moreover, as noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span>, the two methodologies are likely to arrive at the same result, which was the case here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Identification of the Matrimonial Assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The date of determination of pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo &amp; ano</span><span class="font-italic">ther appeal</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Ang Choo</span>”) at [39], the Court of Appeal held that the cut-off date for the division of matrimonial assets can be the date of separation, date of filing of divorce, date of interim judgment, or the date of hearing of ancillary matters. This is because the circumstances of acquiring an asset by a spouse are so varied, and it is best left to the court to determine where the line should be drawn after taking account all the circumstances (at [32]). Indeed, multiple dates are possible, and the adoption of an operative date or dates might not be as critical as arriving at a just and equitable division (at [36] – [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The parties separated in 2012, the divorce petition was filed in 2014 and the Interim Judgment was granted in 2016.

In that case, however, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the fairer date was the date on which the ancillary matters proceedings were commenced. This was because, besides caring for the children (which was not exceptional), some of the husband’s assets which were acquired after the interim judgment date were very substantial, and could be attributed to the wife’s indirect contributions before the interim judgment (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The DJ chose the date of the Interim Judgment (GD, at [7]), and included in the pool of matrimonial assets – the matrimonial flat, the Plaintiff’s car, and the CPF and other savings of parties.

</div> The Plaintiff submits that the proceeds of sale should be subject to division. Although I accept this is correct in principle, it should be noted that the flat was sold some ten years before the matrimonial assets were to be divided.  There is no evidence of how much was left by the time of the Interim Judgment, or even at the time of the separation or the commencement of divorce. There is also a dispute between parties on how the money was spent. The Defendant said that the Plaintiff had used most of it, with $20,000.00 spent on the renovations of the matrimonial flat as well. The Plaintiff denies this.

There, I found that the Plaintiff, the 1st Intervener and the 2nd Intervener to have shares of 87.79%, 5.18% and 7.02%, respectively. I also held that in the event that the matrimonial flat is sold, the net proceeds of sale would be distributed to them according to their shares. Further, as they had used their CPF savings to acquire their interests in the matrimonial flat, they would be required to return to their respective CPF accounts the savings that they had used in accordance with the rules governing such transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, while the Plaintiff’s share of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial flat would be what is available for apportionment upon the sale, what is to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division is a different matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As I have stated in my judgment in the Application, when the acquisition of the Interveners’ beneficial interest in the matrimonial flat was examined against the backdrop of the events that had taken place in 2012, the timing was just too coincidental. The Plaintiff had executed the transfer document on 2 October 2012, very soon after the Defendant, having left the matrimonial flat in August 2012, filed a maintenance application in September 2012, and just before the grant of a consent maintenance order on 18 October 2012. The Plaintiff then filed for divorce on 10 November 2014 on the ground of four years’ separation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The marriage was obviously failing rapidly. As this is not the Plaintiff’s first divorce, he would certainly have been aware of how matrimonial assets are dealt with in a divorce. Moreover, the Plaintiff has stated that he had made the Interveners joint tenants of the matrimonial flat with him because he wanted to let them feel a sense of ownership, and to protect their interest in the matrimonial flat. Indeed, it was his submission in the Application that each Intervener acquired an immediate one-third share in the matrimonial flat as joint tenants. I therefore find that the Plaintiff was taking steps to reduce the Defendant’s potential share of the matrimonial assets in the event that divorce proceedings were commenced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, the Court of Appeal considered how the proceeds of sale of a property ($331,057.77) that was sold two months before the wife commenced divorce proceedings that the husband had disposed of should be dealt with. The husband there had used $43,000.00 to buy a car for the younger son, $18,000.00 to partially repay a car loan, $20,257.00 to help the younger son purchase a HDB flat, $63,000.00 as a loan to a friend (who has not repaid the loan), and $60,000.00 to buy shares in a friend’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The court held at [24] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">….. the issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Interveners were included as joint tenants in 2012, and had been allowed to acquire shares in the beneficial interest in the matrimonial flat. The event was proximate enough in time to the divorce proceedings started by the Plaintiff in 2014, which was on the ground of four years’ separation. Therefore, even if the Plaintiff was not taking steps to reduce the Defendant’s share of the matrimonial flat, the share of interest in the matrimonial flat that the Plaintiff has foregone as a result of including the Interveners as joint tenants has to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets for division. This means that the entire matrimonial flat is in the pool of matrimonial assets.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">BGT v BGU</span>, the husband had bought an apartment in his sole name shortly before he married the wife in 1995, using his CPF savings and a bank loan. They lived in it until 2001, when they moved into a house bought in their joint names. The husband, who paid for the mortgage solely using his CPF savings, sold the apartment about one month before the wife filed for divorce. A sum of $678,996.00 was deposited into his CPF account. Although the High Court held that the apartment was not a matrimonial asset (see [28]), the money that the husband expended after the marriage to pay off the mortgage would have to be included as part of the matrimonial assets (see [29]). This is because if the money was not used to pay off the mortgage, it would have remained in the CPF account and will be available for division. The High Court therefore included for division the $678,996.00 less the husband’s CPF savings of $138,834.48 that were acquired before the marriage.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Court of Appeal, in its decision in <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC</span>, held that assets that become matrimonial assets because of the operation of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>assets acquired before the marriage that became so converted) need not be divided in the same way as matrimonial assets under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>assets acquired during the marriage). The court would have the discretion to divide it in such manner as may be most equitable bearing in mind the nature of the asset, how it was paid for (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>whether it was partly paid for during the course of the marriage) and the length of time during which the parties ordinarily used or enjoyed it during the marriage (at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Unlike the property in <span class="font-italic">BGT v BGU</span> which had already been sold at the time of the division, the matrimonial flat in the present case remained registered to the Plaintiff and the Interveners at the time of the division and the CPF savings used by the Plaintiff to acquire the matrimonial flat were still commingled in the property. In the circumstances, these direct contributions of the Plaintiff should not be excluded before the division. It is only when these premarital direct contributions have reverted to their original form at the time of division, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, when the matrimonial asset has been sold and the proceeds of sale returned to the CPF account, such as in <span class="font-italic">BGT v BGU</span>, that they should be excluded from division. Also, by the time of the time of the separation in 2012, the parties had been living in the matrimonial flat for 9 years if the year of the marriage in 2003 is taken as the starting point, and 19 years, if the starting date of the cohabitation chosen by the DJ (1995) is taken as the starting point. During those years, the Plaintiff has used his CPF savings to pay for the mortgage. It is therefore equitable for the entire value of the matrimonial flat to be included, as the Defendant can be said to have contributed indirectly to the accumulation of those savings through looking after the family and household.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 At the time of the Ancillary Matters hearing, the matrimonial flat was fully paid up. Parties have agreed the valuation of the matrimonial flat to be $500,000.00. Although this was an estimated sum,

</div> the DJ has taken this as the value in making the order for the division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Since I have found at [45] above that the entire matrimonial flat is to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets, it follows that the amount that is available for division is the agreed sum of $500,000.00.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The car</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As I have found at [25] above, the car is a matrimonial asset that is available for division. The DJ has used $54,167.00 as the value of the car (GD, at [6]).  This was the “Price of the Goods” that is stated in the hire purchase agreement, and did not include the “Price of the Certificate of Entitlement”, which was valued at $45,000.00. The agreement stated that the “Cash Price of the Goods” was $99,167.00, which was the total of the two amounts. This would have been the value of the car at the time of the purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 By the time of the Ancillary Matters hearing in November 2016, the car that was bought in April 2016 was only about seven months old. I do not think the DJ was correct to find that its value has depreciated by almost half. In my view, a more correct depreciation would be about 10%, and the value of the car at the time of the Ancillary Matters hearing would thus be $90,000.00. At the start of the hire purchase agreement, the Plaintiff had to pay 59 monthly instalments of $557.00. As he would have paid seven instalments by November 2016, the remaining loan was $28,964.00 ($557.00 x {59 - 7}). The net value of the car was thus $61,000.00 ($90,000.00 - $28,964.00, rounded down). I therefore include this amount into the pool of matrimonial assets for division.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The CPF and other bank savings of the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The CPF savings of the Plaintiff were acquired over the years, both before and after his marriage to the Defendant. When the Plaintiff turned 55 in March 2010, he became eligible to withdraw the savings in his CPF Account that year, but did not do so. There is no evidence of what the amount was, or if he made any withdrawals. By 28 June 2016, the balances in his CPF Account were as set out in the table below:

The Interveners’ payments cannot be counted as part of the Plaintiff’s contributions as these were not loans to him, but amounts they paid to acquire their respective interests in the matrimonial flat. Indeed, at the time the Interveners made their payments, the Plaintiff had enough CPF savings to discharge the mortgage himself. Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s direct contribution was $186,271.24.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Defendant claimed that the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial flat in her 1995 marriage were paid into a bank account which the Plaintiff became a joint account holder of, and he had availed himself to the money. She further claimed that the amounts he withdrew included $20,000.00 that he spent on the renovation of the matrimonial flat when she moved in after their marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that the ratio of direct contributions represents “each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the<span class="font-italic"> </span>acquisition <span class="font-italic">or improvement </span>of the matrimonial assets” (at [22]). Thus contributions to renovations can be considered as direct contributions if it can be shown that the renovations had improved the matrimonial flat. This would usually be the case when the asset is first acquired, and renovations are needed to make it habitable. For renovations which take place long after its acquisition, evidence of improvement would be necessary to show that the matrimonial asset was indeed improved by the renovation. In the present case, there was no such evidence. Although the DJ did find that the Defendant had contributed $20,000.00 towards renovation, and treated the amount as her direct contributions, I am unable to do so as there was no evidence that the renovations did improve the matrimonial flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Moreover, the only documentary evidence that the Defendant furnished in support was for the cleaning of the air conditioners in the matrimonial flat. She explained that she was unable to obtain the necessary documents because she could not gain access to the matrimonial flat where these were kept. While I was reluctant to overturn the finding of fact by the DJ, I could only consider the amount as part of her indirect contributions instead. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The car</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The DJ has used the value of the car ($54,167.00) as the direct contribution of the Plaintiff in the acquisition of the car. I do not think this is correct. The direct contributions of a matrimonial asset are the amounts spent by parties to acquire it. In this case, the Plaintiff had paid a cash sum of $69,999.00 at the time of purchase, and monthly instalments of $557.00 from 14 May 2016. By the hearing of the ancillary matters in November 2016, he would have paid instalments of $3,899.00 ($557.00 x 7). His contributions would therefore have been $73,898.00 ($69,999.00 + $3,899.00), and not $54,167.00. I will use this amount as the Plaintiff’s direct contributions for the car.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The CPF and bank savings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As stated above, the CPF savings of the parties that formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets is $169,823.77 for the Plaintiff and $3,400.00 for the Defendant, and the bank savings of the Plaintiff is $7,000.00. I will treat them as parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition of these assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The length of the marriage is generally a factor to be considered when dealing with the division of matrimonial assets to establish a party’s indirect contributions to the marriage. An issue which arose in this respect was whether the date of alleged cohabitation or the date of the marriage should have been used as the commencement date for length of marriage. Although the parties registered their marriage in 2003 and Interim Judgment and Final Judgment were granted in 2016, making it a marriage of 13 years, the DJ has treated this a marriage of 20 years (GD, at [6]). This is because she found that the parties were cohabiting since 1993, before their marriage was registered. This was based on the uncontested Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) before the affidavits filed in the ancillary matters averred otherwise. However, the DJ chose as the starting year 1995, when the Defendant’s previous marriage ended. She took the end of the marriage to be when Interim Judgment was obtained, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> 2016 (GD, at [7]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Plaintiff disputed that he and the Defendant had started cohabitation from 1993/1994, and that she was helping him to look after the Interveners. He said that she was only a paid baby sitter after his previous wife left in 1994, and it was his mother who was looking after them. The Interveners were only either eight and six, or nine and seven, in 1993/1994. The Plaintiff claimed that at the time his wife left him, they were independent and was able to walk to their school nearby, and he was able to buy them meals, wash their clothes, and care for them when he returned from work. The Defendant’s version was that the Plaintiff often stayed away for weeks. The Interveners frequently missed their school bus and called her, and she would have to rush to bring them to school. They would also mess up the kitchen when they tried to cook, and she had to clean up after them as they were afraid of being disciplined by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having regard to the evidence of the parties, I do not think that the DJ was wrong to conclude that parties had started cohabitation in 1993/1994. The Plaintiff was then employed in a petrol refinery as a technician doing shift work on an island off the southern shore of Singapore.

He could not have done all that he was claiming to do, and managed without help. The admission by the Plaintiff that one of the Interveners had gone to live for a few months with the Defendant in 1999 after parties had a quarrel and she moved out was also evidence of the close relationship between her and the Interveners, and showed that it was she and not the Interveners’ grandmother who was looking after them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Moreover, the Plaintiff had his dates wrong.

</div> which refused to treat the period of cohabitation as being included in “the duration of the marriage” within the meaning of s 25(1)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (UK). That section provides that for both financial provision orders (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> maintenance) and property adjustment orders (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> division of assets), the court should take into account the “duration<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the marriage”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The factors to be considered when dividing matrimonial assets are set out in s 112(2) of the WC.

</div> These included his payslips, letters from his former employer which would confirm if he did receive any retirement benefits when he retired after working for 40 years, or had other assets that he did not disclose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I agree with the Defendant that the documents could have been obtained by the Plaintiff if he had wanted to. For example, even though he has now left his employment, he could have obtained a written confirmation from his former employer to support his position. Statements from banks, credit card companies, CDP and IRAS could also be obtained if requests were made. Even if such documents were not forthcoming, there was nothing to show that he has even tried to ask for them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Plaintiff has since belatedly furnished the documents listed in para 5 of the Appellant’s Case. These are: his payslips for 2015 (April to November), 2016 (March to July and September to December) and 2017 (March to April); photograph of the gold medal he received upon his retirement in 2015; letter from the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) to show that he does not and did not have any SGX accounts; 2016 Notice of Assessment from IRAS; CPF statements for 2015 and 2016; CPF Investment Scheme yearly statements for 2014 to 2016; letter from DBS stating that he does not have a DBS Cashline account, nor certain credit card accounts; monthly statements of his POSB current and savings accounts from January 2014 to July 2015 and August 2015 to April 2017; quarterly credit card statements for 2014 and 2015 and others. He submitted that they show that there was no basis for an adverse inference to be drawn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Leaving aside the prejudice to the Defendant who now has to deal with a case of the Plaintiff that is not the same as that at the Ancillary Matters hearing before the DJ, I am of the view that these documents still do not fully address all the reasons for the drawing of the adverse inference. For example, while the 2016 Notice of Assessment shows his taxable income from 2015, there is still no information on what he received from his former employer. Besides the gold medal, there is no indication if he received other retirement benefits, such as a lump sum pension, which do not normally appear in payslips as it is not a salary, that may be subject to different rules for taxation. Nor did the Plaintiff provide statements of a bank account that was revealed in his first Affidavit of Means, nor bank accounts which would show where the over $230,000.00 that he withdrew from his CPF Account have moved to.

The increase in the Defendant’s share of the matrimonial properties by 10% ordered by the DJ was within her discretion based on the non-disclosure of the documents at the time of the Ancillary Matters hearing, and I do not see any reason to depart from it based on the non-disclosure of the documents at the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I now turn to whether the overall division of the assets is just and equitable in the light of parties’ direct and indirect contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 If the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v </span><span class="font-italic">ANK</span> is used, the parties’ direct and indirect contributions are as set out in the table below:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Type of contribution</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defendant</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total</span></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-italic">Direct Contributions</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Matrimonial flat ($)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">186,271.24</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">-</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">186,271.24</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Car ($)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">73,898.00</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">-</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">73,898.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">CPF savings ($)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">169,823.77</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">3,400.00</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">173,223.77</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Other savings ($)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">7,000.00</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">-</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">7,000.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total ($)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">436,993.01</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">3,400.00</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">440,393.01</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Percentage (%)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">99.23</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">0.77</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">100.00</span></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="txt-body text-center"><span class="font-italic">Indirect Contributions</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Percentage (%)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">50.00</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">50.00</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">100.00</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Average (%)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">74.62</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">25.38</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">100.00</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The difference between the above calculations and the DJ’s calculation stems mainly from the exclusion of the $20,000.00 from the Defendant’s direct contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 However, as I have pointed out at [18] above, this was a single income marriage. Accordingly, the approach in <span class="font-italic">TNL v </span><span class="font-italic">TNK</span> should be used instead of the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider if different weightages should be given to the direct financial contributions and indirect contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Having accepted that the marriage should be treated as one lasting 20 years, I am of the view that it would be just and equitable to give the Defendant 41% of the matrimonial assets. This is after taking into consideration the adverse inference drawn against the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Based on the pool of matrimonial assets of $741,223.77, the Defendant’s share will be $303,901.75, which is a little more than the $303,098.00 ordered by the DJ. Since there is no appeal by the Defendant, her share of the matrimonial assets will remain as that ordered by the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apportionment of the Matrimonial Assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As the Plaintiff has on 1 August 2016 withdrawn over $230,000.00 from his CPF Account, the option in the order of the DJ for the Plaintiff to transfer to the Defendant various amounts from his CPF Account (in the event he wishes to retain the matrimonial flat) is no longer available. With the only major matrimonial asset available for satisfying an order of the division of these assets being the matrimonial flat, I order that it be sold within six months of this order, and for the net proceeds of sale to be used to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The proceeds of sale, after deducting the relevant expenses incurred in the sale, shall be distributed as follows –</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $299,698.00 (being $303,098.00 - $3,400.00) to be paid to the Defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Defendant is to retain her CPF savings of $3,400.00;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 5.18% and 7.02% of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial flat to be paid to the 1st Intervener and 2nd Intervener, respectively, from the Plaintiff’s share of the net proceeds of sale, with each of them to refund to their respective CPF accounts such amounts as are required under the CPF rules;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the balance of the net proceeds of sale to be paid to the Plaintiff, with him to refund to his CPF account such amounts as are required under the CPF rules; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Plaintiff is to retain his car, and other CPF and bank savings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Regarding the quantum of maintenance, the Defendant asked for a maintenance amount of $850.00 per month, which was the amount ordered under the consent order in 2012, for a period of ten years. She asked that this be paid in a lump sum given the multiple times the Plaintiff has defaulted in making the maintenance payments ordered previously. The total amount was therefore $102,000.00 ($850.00 x 12 x 10). The Plaintiff, on the other hand, asked that there be no maintenance, or that the amount should be reduced (GD, at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The DJ considered the factors set out in s 114 of the WC, and reviewed the expenses claimed by the Defendant when deciding the reasonable amount that she needs for maintenance. She reduced the monthly maintenance sum to $400.00. Taking note of the Plaintiff’s health condition, she took the view that he could still work for another 10 years, and ordered a lump sum payment of $50,000.00 ($400.00 x 12 x 10, rounded up) (GD, at [8] and [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I accept that unless the DJ has committed an error of law or principle, or failed to take into consideration crucial facts, it is not for an appellate court to interfere with the order and substitute what it views should be the correct amount for maintenance. In this regard, I do not think that the DJ was wrong in deciding that a fair amount for the Defendant’s monthly maintenance was $400.00. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 With regard to the period of maintenance, the Plaintiff submitted it should not exceed 3 years.

A maintenance period of 10 years assumes that he is likely to be employed until 71 years old, and will receive the same or similar pay until he stops working eventually. I do not think that this is realistic, given that he was already suffering from Stage 4 cancer. The Plaintiff asked for the maintenance period not to exceed three years. I agree that a more appropriate period is three years from the date of the ancillary matters order. In doing so, I note that after the diagnosis and treatment that he received in 2014, a medical report in 2015 shows that it has spread.

This amount of $14,400.00 ($400.00 x 12 x 3) is an amount which the Plaintiff will be in a position to pay using his share of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial flat, and will not cripple him financially.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the division of the matrimonial assets, this Appeal involves the consideration of evidence that was not before the DJ, for example, the documents on the financial contributions of the Interveners towards the matrimonial flat, and various documents on the finances of the Plaintiff from the banks, credit card companies, IRAS and the CPF.
