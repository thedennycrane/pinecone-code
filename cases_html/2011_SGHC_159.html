                    an application under s 4 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act
                    (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) regarding the sale of a
                    two-storey shophouse at 145 and 145A Sims Avenue, Singapore 387467 (“the
                    Property”). The Plaintiffs are asking for:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the Dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiffs were granted the Option to
                    purchase the Property, which was 217.5 sq m, for $2.85 million. In return for
                    the Option, they paid an option fee of $28,500.00. On 15 April 2011, they
                    exercised the Option and paid a further sum of $256,500 (10% of the purchase
                    price minus the option fee). Following the exercise of the Option, the
                    Plaintiffs’ solicitors sent their legal requisitions to the various
                    relevant authorities, including the LTA. The original completion date of the
                    Option was 10 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In LTA’s reply contained in the
                    28 April 2011 Road Line Plan, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors noted that a
                    substantial portion of the Property was coloured in red and required as Road
                    Reserve. According to paragraph 3.1 of the Explanatory Note accompanying the
                    28 April 2011 Road Line Plan, the portions of land required as Road Reserve
                    are to be:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">set aside when development/redevelopment takes place on the subject lots
                            <b><u>or</u></b> when road construction/ improvement
                        is carried out by the Land Transport Authority, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The LTA confirmed in a letter dated 5 May
                    2011 that the land is required to be set aside when development/redevelopment
                    takes place <em>or</em> when road construction/improvement
                    is carried out by LTA, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiffs estimated that about 40% of the
                    Property was required as Road Reserve and will have to be set aside when either
                    development/redevelopment <em>or</em> road
                    construction/improvement is carried out. The Plaintiffs therefore argued that
                    LTA’s reply was clearly unsatisfactory since the road reserve will require
                    a substantial portion of the land to be surrendered to LTA and the existing
                    building to be reconstructed when road construction or improvement is to be
                    carried out by LTA. This will substantially diminish the Property’s value.
                    Their solicitors gave notice to the Defendant’s solicitors on
                    28 April 2011 that the Plaintiffs were rescinding the agreement pursuant to
                    clause 10 of the Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Clause 10 of the Option is set out as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The sale and purchase herein shall be <em>subject to the
                            Purchaser’s solicitors receiving satisfactory replies to their

                        to the various Government Departments and Land Transport Authority (LTA)
                        insofar as such replies/Interpretation Plan relate to the Property and
                            <em>if any of such replies and/or Interpretation Plan are

                        forthwith refund to the Purchaser all monies paid by the Purchaser to the
                        Vendor or the Vendor’s solicitors but without any interest,
                        compensation or deductions whatsoever and thereupon neither party shall have
                        any claim or demand against the other for costs, damages, compensation or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics, emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Defendant’s solicitors replied on
                    29 April 2011 that the Plaintiffs had no right to rescind because of clause
                        10(<em>b</em>) of the Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The dispute thus centred on the legal
                    interpretation of clause 10(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Legal Interpretation of Clause 10(<em>b</em>) of the Option</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ Interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiffs’ interpretation gave clause
                    10 (<em>b)</em> a narrow ambit. The Plaintiffs argued that
                    proviso (<em>b</em>) specifically contains the words in
                    parentheses “(whether actual or proposed or to be implemented <em>only</em> if there is any redevelopment of the
                    property)” (emphasis added). Proviso (<em>b</em>)
                    thus failed to deal with the situation, in the present case, where the road
                    reserve will <em>also</em> be implemented when road
                    construction/improvement is carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiffs have thus read the words in the
                    parentheses “(whether actual or proposed or to be implemented <em>only</em> if there is any redevelopment of the
                    property)” as <b><em>limiting</em></b> what will be
                        <em>deemed</em> as a satisfactory reply by the LTA. The
                    limiting phrase “only if there is any redevelopment of the
                    property” will apply to “actual”, “proposed”
                    and “to be implemented”. Under such a reading, clause 10
                        (<em>b</em>) will not deprive the Plaintiffs of their
                    right to rescind under the general provision of clause 10 which makes the Option
                    “subject to satisfactory replies”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s Interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defendant’s interpretation gave
                    clause 10(<em>b</em>) a very wide ambit. The Defendant
                    argued that the key structure of clause 10(<em>b</em>) is:
                        “<em>any</em> road or drainage line schemes or
                    proposals… affecting any part of the property shall be construed as
                    satisfactory” (emphasis added). The words in the parentheses thus do not
                    limit what will be deemed as a satisfactory reply by the LTA, but they merely
                    “amplified” the “plain meaning of the key structure of
                    clause 10(b)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Under such a reading, clause 10
                        (<em>b</em>) will deem satisfactory LTA’s reply
                    that the Road Reserve will set aside the land when development/redevelopment
                    takes place <em>or</em> when road construction/improvement
                    is carried out by LTA, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Defendant further argued that the words in
                    parentheses “merely set out 3 scenarios where the key structure of the
                    clause will have an impact”, as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) “Actual” road line schemes or proposals affecting any
                        part of the property. In other words the authorities have implemented
                        schemes and proposals which are taking place currently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) “Proposed” road line schemes or proposals affecting any
                        part of the property. In other words the authorities contemplate the
                        implementation of the schemes and proposals in the future. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) Road line schemes or proposals affecting any part of the property
                        which are “to be implemented only if there is any redevelopment of
                        the property”. In other words, these schemes or proposals will
                            <u>not</u> be implemented by the authorities
                        unless and until the redevelopment of the property is initiated and
                        commenced. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under such an interpretation, the phrase “only if there is any
                    redevelopment of the property” applies only to “to be
                    implemented”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Preferred Interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The crux of the interpretation of clause
                        10(<em>b</em>) therefore lies in the effect given to
                    the words in the parentheses. Are they to be interpreted as (i) <b><em>limiting</em></b> what will be deemed satisfactory or (ii)
                        <b><em>enumerating</em></b> merely an example of one of the
                    scenarios that will be deemed a satisfactory reply? In my view, the
                    Plaintiff’s interpretation is to be preferred and Clause 10 (<em>b</em>) has a narrow ambit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i) Clause 10 of the Option to be considered in its entirety </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     First, the nature of clause 10 of the Option
                    should be considered in its entirety. Clause 10 of the Option consists of the
                    general provision allowing the Purchaser to rescind the Option if the replies to
                    the legal requisitions are found to be <em>unsatisfactory</em>, with the specific proviso of clause 10
                        (<em>b</em>) deeming certain <em>types</em> of replies as satisfactory. It is important to consider
                    the commercial context of clauses such as Clause 10 of the Option, since the
                    Court of Appeal case of <em>Sandar Aung v Parkway Hospitals
                        Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 891
                        (“<em>Sandar Aung</em>”) on reviewing the
                    principles governing the construction of documents has at [29] stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key concept here is that of <em>context</em>. No
                        contract exists in a vacuum and, consequently, its language must be
                        construed in the context in which the contract concerned has been made. We
                        would go so far as to state that even if the plain language of the contract
                        appears otherwise clear, the construction consequently placed on such
                        language should not be inconsistent with the context in which the contract
                        was entered into if this context is clear or even obvious, since the context
                        and circumstances in which the contract was made reflect the intention of
                        the parties when they entered into the contract and utilised the language
                        they did. It might well be the case that if a particular construction is
                        placed on the language in a given contract is inconsistent with what is the
                        obvious context in which the contract was made, then <em>that</em> construction might <em>not</em> be
                        as clear as was initially thought and might, on the contract, be evidence of

                    1 WLR 989 at 996 as emphasising the “general task of the court

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is often said that, in order to be admissible in aid of construction,

                        contract, but this requirement should not be stated in too narrow a sense.

                    in <em>Chu Yik Man v S Rajagopal &amp; Co &amp; Anor</em>
                    [1987] 2 MLJ 557 at 559:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, the common thread that runs through these three decisions [he
                        was referring to <b>Tatlien</b>`s case, <b>Teo Hong Choo</b>`s case and <b>Peh Kwee
                            Yong</b>`s case (at first instance)] was the intention of the
                        parties as expressed in the formula `satisfactory reply to requisitions`. In
                        my view, that formula is intended to give the purchaser substantially what
                        he has bargained for, taking into account his purpose in purchasing the
                        property and such other circumstances which have a direct or indirect effect
                        on the fulfilment of that purpose. <em>What seems clear is
                            that the general provision allowing the Purchaser to rescind if the
                            replies to the legal requisitions are unsatisfactory is to give the
                            Purchaser what he substantially bargained for</em>. The clause
                        regarding legal requisitions allows parties to sign “instant
                        contracts”, ie the Option, before checking if there are road plans,
                        etc, affecting the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics, emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The commercial context and understanding of clause 10 regarding the
                    replies to the legal requisitions is thus clear – the general provision
                    allowing the Purchaser to rescind if the replies to the legal requisitions are
                    unsatisfactory is to give the Purchaser what he substantially bargained for
                    because parties recognise that the Purchaser had not been given a chance to
                    check if there are road proposals affecting the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In this context, the specific proviso in
                    clause 10(<em>b</em>) is thus an <em>exception</em> to the general right of the Purchaser to rescind the
                    agreement if the replies to the legal requisitions are unsatisfactory. It may
                    also be understood as providing certainty between parties of what replies are
                    clearly deemed satisfactory in order to prevent dispute between parties in the
                    future. Therefore, if the Defendant’s interpretation is to be adopted;
                    that “<em>any</em> road or drainage line schemes or
                    proposals… affecting any part of the property shall be construed as
                    satisfactory” – the necessary implication is that <b>no</b> reply from the LTA concerning any road or drainage
                    line scheme or proposal no matter how drastically it may affect the property
                    could ever be unsatisfactory. Such a reading actually renders hollow the general
                    right of the Purchaser to rescind the agreement in regard of replies from the
                    LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Under the Defendant’s reading, even if
                    the road proposal affects 90% of the land area of the Property, the Purchaser
                    cannot rescind the agreement by stating that the reply from LTA was
                    unsatisfactory. If <em>indeed</em> that was what the
                    Purchaser bargained for, there is no reason for the court not to uphold such a
                    bargain, however unfair it must seem to the Purchaser. However, when the
                    phrasing of the specific proviso of clause 10(<em>b</em>)
                    is ambiguous enough to support two completely different interpretations (to be
                    developed further at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> below), there is
                    much merit in letting the general provision in clause 10 prevail over the
                    exception in the specific proviso of clause 10(<em>b</em>)
                    or even applying the rule of <em>contra
                    proferentum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In fact, in <em>Wong Meng Yuen
                        Eddie &amp; Anor v Soh Chee Kong &amp; Ors</em> [1990]
                    3 MLJ 352 (“<em>Wong Meng Yuen
                    Eddie</em>”), the court held that if the vendor wanted to rely on
                    the specific proviso deeming certain types of replies to the requisition as
                    satisfactory, the vendor bore the burden of proving that the specific proviso
                    was fulfilled. Therefore, the burden of proof is on the Defendant to show that
                    clause 10(<em>b</em>) is satisfied to render LTA’s
                    reply as satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii) Ambiguity in the Drafting of Clause 10(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The usual grammatical use of the parentheses
                    is that the material within could be omitted without affecting the meaning of
                    the sentence. The usual grammatical use of the parentheses would thus support
                    the Defendant’s interpretation of clause 10(<em>b</em>) since the Defendant argued that the words in the parentheses
                    only <em>amplifies</em> and is explanatory of the main
                    sentence. However, such a reading does not rest naturally with the <em>actual</em> words that are contained within the parentheses -
                    “(whether actual or proposed or to be implemented <em>only</em> if there is any redevelopment of the property)”
                    (emphasis added). The use of the word “<em>only</em>” in the parentheses goes against the Defendant’s
                    argument that the words in the parentheses <em>amplifies</em> the main sentence – a more natural reading would
                    be that it <em>limits</em> the substance of the main
                    sentence. In my view, the words in the parentheses is explanatory of what
                        <em>type</em> of replies clause 10(<em>b</em>) deems satisfactory – however the word
                    “only” in the words in the parentheses suggests that the sphere of
                    application of clause 10(<em>b</em>) is <em>restricted</em> by what is set out within the parentheses. Therefore,
                    the words in the parentheses will <em>exhaustively
                        define</em> the type of replies clause 10(<em>b</em>) will deem satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The critical question would be how to
                    interpret the words in the parentheses. The Defendant’s interpretation of
                    the words in the parentheses broke the words up into unnatural divisions –
                    “(actual <em>or</em> proposed <em>or</em> to be implemented only if there is any redevelopment of the
                    property)” (emphasis added). As stated in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above, under such an interpretation, the phrase
                    “only if there is any redevelopment of the property” applies only
                    to “to be implemented”. As the Defendant argued that the words in
                    the parentheses are explanatory of the main sentence of clause 10(<em>b</em>), such an interpretation would mean that <b>all</b> the possible scenarios under “any road or
                    drainage line schemes or proposals… affecting any part of the
                    property” shall be construed as satisfactory. However, such an
                    interpretation would make the words in the parentheses completely unnecessary.
                    If parties had indeed intended for clause 10(<em>b</em>) to
                    have such a wide sphere of application – for any road or drainage line
                    schemes or proposals whether <em>actual</em> or <em>proposed</em> or <em>implemented only if there
                        is any redevelopment of the property</em> to be deemed a satisfactory
                    reply, the simplest and clearest way would be to <em>delete the
                        words in the parentheses altogether</em>, <em>ie</em>,:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">any road or drainage line schemes or proposals <del>(whether actual or proposed or to be implemented
                            only if there is any redevelopment of the property)</del> affecting
                        any part of the property shall be construed as satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my opinion, the commercial context of the
                    Option supports the view that the words in the parentheses were carefully and
                    specifically chosen. The significance of the words in the parentheses becomes
                    even more apparent when we interpret it within the commercial context of replies
                    to legal requisitions regarding road or drainage proposals that are <em>typically</em> deemed satisfactory in Option to Purchases. In
                        <em>Wong Meng Yuen Eddie</em> and <em>Kua Beng Koon v Kwok Wai Tien &amp; Anor</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR 101, the specific deeming proviso was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">any replies to legal requisitions or plan indicating that the said
                        property will be affected by road or drainage proposal or government
                        acquisition or scheme <em>arising from a redevelopment of the
                            said property</em> shall not be deemed to be
                        unsatisfactory;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Choo Boo Ching &amp; Anor v Heng Guan Hong
                        Geoffrey</em> [1997] SGHC 99, the specific deeming provision
                    similarly emphasized that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[f]or the avoidance of doubt any road or drainage line or proposal which
                        is to be <em>implemented only if there is any redevelopment
                            of the property</em> shall be deemed to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although these specific deeming provisos are not strictly standard
                    clauses, they reflect a common commercial understanding that it is a <em>narrow group</em> of road or drainage proposals that are
                    generally found to be consistent with what the Purchaser has substantially
                    bargained for and will typically be deemed satisfactory, <em>ie</em>, road or drainage proposals that affect the property
                        <u>only if there is any redevelopment of the
                        property</u>. In my view, the particular phrase “<em>only if there is any redevelopment of the
                        property”</em> in the parentheses was intended by parties to
                    apply to road or drainage line schemes or proposals whether “actual
                        <em>or</em> proposed <em>or</em>
                    to be implemented” and not only to “implemented”. Any other
                    reading would not give the phrase “only if there is any redevelopment of
                    the property” the operative effect the parties intended for the
                    specifically chosen phrase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is trite law that the court’s main
                    objective in interpreting a contract is to ascertain the objective intention of
                    parties (see <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold
                        Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 1029). If the parties had intended to deviate from the
                    commercial norm of restricting the deeming of satisfactory replies to road or
                    drainage proposals that affect the property “<em>only if
                        there is any redevelopment of the property</em>”, such an
                    intention would be best exemplified, as suggested in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above, by deleting any reference to the phrase in clause
                        10(<em>b</em>) altogether. The fact that the particular
                    phrase was placed within the parentheses supports the proposition that the
                    parties did not objectively intend to <em>deviate</em> from
                    such a commercial norm. This was a case where the substance of the clause should
                    take precedence over the “form” of the clause in the use of
                    parentheses. The court should not read clause 10(<em>b</em>) such as to render otiose the Purchaser’s general right to
                    rescind the agreement if LTA’s reply to the legal requisitions is
                    unsatisfactory based solely on the use of parentheses. Furthermore, the
                    Defendant’s reading of clause 10 (<em>b</em>) renders
                    the words within the parentheses unnecessary when the specific examples embodied
                    in the parentheses lead to the more natural inference that it was parties’
                    intention to limit only these <em>specific types</em> of
                    replies as satisfactory. It is clear within the commercial context of the case
                    that the words in the parentheses were carefully chosen to give the Purchaser
                    what they substantially bargained for in the Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Therefore, it is my opinion that reading the
                    sphere of application of clause 10(<em>b</em>) as being
                        <em>limited</em> by the words in the parentheses to
                    give operative effect to the phrase “only if there is any redevelopment
                    of the property” will be the reading most faithful to the commercial
                    understanding and objective intention of parties. If clause 10(<em>b</em>) was really meant to have the draconian effect as
                    argued by the Defendant, <em>eg</em>, any road or drainage
                    line scheme or proposal would be deemed as satisfactory regardless if it
                    affected 99% of the land area of the Property, such a clause could have and
                    should have been drafted clearly. Under clause 10(<em>b</em>)’s particular phrasing with the specific choice of words
                    in the parentheses, clause 10(<em>b</em>) is restricted to
                    deeming satisfactory any road or drainage line schemes or proposals (whether
                    actual or proposed or to be implemented <em><u>only</u></em><em>if there is any redevelopment of the
                    property</em>).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1    Where the Vendor is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    unable, or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) unwilling, because of difficulty, delay or expense or for other
                        reasonable cause, to remove or to comply with any objection or
                        requisition of the Purchaser as to title, contract, sale plan and these
                        Conditions, the Vendor has the right to annul the sale, notwithstanding
                        any previous negotiation or litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.2    The Vendor must give the Purchaser not less than
                            10 days’ written notice to annul the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.3    The sale is to be treated as annulled after the
                            Vendor’s notice has expired, unless the objection or requisition
                            is withdrawn before the expiry of that notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.4    When the sale is annulled, the Purchaser is
                            entitled to the return of the deposit but without interest, costs or
                            compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Therefore, as the specific proviso in clause
                        10(<em>b</em>) only deems any road proposal
                    satisfactory whether actual or proposed or implemented <em>only
                        if there is any redevelopment of property</em>, it cannot deem
                    LTA’s reply in this case satisfactory as the road proposal includes the
                    possibility of setting aside the land <em><u>also</u></em><u>when road construction/improvement is carried
                    out</u>. Therefore, the Purchaser has the right to rescind the agreement
                    based on an unsatisfactory reply from the LTA and the Defendant could not argue
                    that a road proposal that affected 40% of the Property’s land area would
                    be satisfactory on any reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Plaintiffs are entitled to receive the
                    declarations (as stated in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) that
                    they asked for. I order the Defendant to pay the Plaintiffs a sum of $285,000
                    without any “interest, compensation or deductions” based on the
                    general provision in Clause 10 of the Option. Clause 10 also states that
                    “neither party shall have any claim or demand against the other for
                        <em>costs</em>, damages, compensation or
                    otherwise” (emphasis added). I am of the provisional view that the
                    parties in reference to “costs” in Clause 10 did not intend for it
                    to cover litigation costs of a <em>contested</em>
                    application regarding the satisfactoriness of the reply to the legal
                    requisitions. Furthermore, s 4(2) of the CLPA enables the court to order how and
                    by whom the cost of the application under s 4 of the CLPA should be paid. Unless
                    the parties wish to be heard on costs or to have them fixed, I order the
                    Defendant to pay the Plaintiffs’ costs for this application to be taxed if
                    not agreed.</p>
