        Lee Kim Shin JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Disputes
between family members over family assets are some of the most difficult
cases to adjudicate for a number of reasons. The evidence is usually
incomplete either because family members generally do not document
their dealings unlike in a commercial environment, or because a long
passage of time has passed between the events which give rise to
the dispute and the commencement of proceedings, or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
veracity of the available evidence too is often difficult to assess, especially
when much of the evidence comprises direct testimony from family
members, most of whom are emotionally charged by the dispute and therefore
prone to dramatising their recollection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       That
was the exact scenario I struggled with in this unhappy dispute involving
the administration of a Muslim estate. The dispute is between a mother
(“Mother”), her eldest son (“Jahir”) and two daughters (“Aysha” and
“Noorjahan”) on the one side (collectively “the Plaintiffs”), and
another son as the sole defendant on the other (“Dawood”). I will
sometimes refer to Jahir, Aysha and Noorjahan collectively as “the
Plaintiff Siblings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
sole family asset that was in dispute is a landed property at No.
4 Merryn Terrace (“the Property”) which had been conveyed into the
joint names of Mother and Dawood in 2005 following the death of
the father (“Father”) in 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Plaintiffs’ principal claim was that Dawood had deceived them in a
number of ways which caused the Plaintiffs to agree to the conveyance
of the Property to him and Mother as joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After
considering the pleadings and the evidence in detail, I dismissed the
Plaintiffs’ claims on 8 July 2014. Whilst there were problems with
the narrative from both sides, the burden ultimately was on the
Plaintiffs to prove their case, which they did not do. I was not
convinced that Dawood had, on a balance of probabilities, procured
the conveyance of the Property through deceitful means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I
had intimated at the commencement of proceedings that the dispute was
one that perhaps ought to have been mediated and settled. I repeated this
hope that parties could settle their differences amicably to the
parties’ counsel in the course of delivering my oral judgment. I
did this because I was convinced that a mutually beneficial settlement
was a realistic possibility (particularly having regard to the fact
that Mother remains a joint tenant), if only the parties could put
aside their bitterness and prioritise the bond of family that they
used to cherish.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Given
that the Plaintiffs have appealed against my decision, it would appear
that the parties are not able to resolve their dispute without a
final decision of the Court of Appeal. These are my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Property was purchased in cash by Father in June 1979 and registered
in Father’s sole name. The Property had been the family home since
its purchase though, at the time of the proceedings, only Mother
and a helper lived in the Property. The four children, all of whom
are married, moved out of the Property at different times. The last
of them to move out was Dawood in November 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Father
suffered a stroke sometime between 1989 and 1993 (the date was disputed
but nothing turns on this) and was bedridden until he passed away
in March 2000. Jahir and Dawood both took on the fatherly role in
the household in maintaining the family, the home and Father’s business
from the time Father became bedridden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Father’s
business in question is the sale of mutton at a stall in Tekka market.
At that time, it was the sole source of income for the family. Jahir helped
with the running of the business even before Father became ill, whereupon
Jahir took over the running of the business and Dawood came on board
to assist Jahir. It was agreed between all the parties that Jahir
was the successor of the mutton stall business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dawood
was then a first-year student studying accountancy at the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU). He suspended his studies to help
out with the mutton stall business which appeared to be facing some financial
difficulty. He stopped helping with the business sometime in 1996 but
he did not return to NTU to complete his studies. Instead, he enrolled as
a cadet with Singapore Airlines (SIA) and eventually became a pilot.
He is still a pilot with SIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
only family members who were living at the Property after 2001 were
Dawood and Mother. Everyone else had moved out by then. Noorjahan
moved out around 1992, Aysha in 1996, and Jahir in 2001. The Property
was still in Father’s name in 2001 even though he had passed away close
to a year ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Inheritance Certificates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
first attempt to administer Father’s estate came about four months
after the demise of Father, in July 2000. Dawood wrote to the Syariah
court on 13 July 2000 seeking what is known as a Certificate of Inheritance.
The certificate was issued on 21 July 2000 (“the 1st Inheritance Certificate”).
Curiously, it named Mother and himself as the only beneficiaries
of Father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
1st Inheritance Certificate only surfaced in the course of cross-examination.
It was produced by Dawood in response to a question by the counsel
for the Plaintiffs, Mr Bernard Sahagar (“Mr Sahagar”). But it was quickly
ascertained and agreed to by all sides that the 1st Inheritance Certificate
was erroneous. The Plaintiff Siblings were excluded under the 1st
Inheritance Certificate because their names were omitted in the
answer provided by Dawood to the staff officer who had asked who
was living at the Property at the time the request was made for
the 1st Certificate of Inheritance. Whatever the case, because the
parties agreed that the 1st Inheritance Certificate had no evidential
value, and that it was the later Inheritance Certificate obtained
on 24 February 2004 (“the 2nd Inheritance Certificate”) that was
material, I did not think it was necessary to give any weight to
the 1st Inheritance Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
2nd Inheritance Certificate was obtained by Dawood (see [18] below),
but this time as the properly appointed administrator of Father’s estate.
He was appointed by the Plaintiffs sometime in early 2004 (certainly before
February 2004). There was some dispute as to why the family decided
to appoint an administrator in 2004 when nothing had been done for <em>almost four years</em> after Father’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Again,
this difference was immaterial to the outcome as the Plaintiffs had
agreed that Dawood was to be appointed as administrator by the family to
handle the administration of father’s estate. That was not in dispute. Specifically,
the Plaintiffs also agreed that Dawood was authorised to consult
solicitors, that, after such consultation, he had reported to the family
that they needed to apply for letters of administration, and that Dawood
was authorised to apply for letters of administration on behalf
of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Dated
24 February 2004, the application for the 2nd Inheritance Certificate
was not made by Dawood but by Messrs Harjeet Singh &amp; Co, the firm
of solicitors engaged by Dawood. The lawyers who dealt with Dawood were
Mr Harjeet Singh and Ms Gurmeet Kaur (hereafter collectively referred
to as “the Solicitors”). The Solicitors appeared as Dawood’s witnesses
in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
beneficiaries of Father’s estate and their respective entitlement were
listed under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Jahir
(son) – 14 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dawood
(son) – 14 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mother
– 6 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     Aysha
(daughter) – 7 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     Noorjahan
– 7 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Plaintiffs claimed that they (or at least Aysha and Noorjahan) were
shocked at how little of Father’s estate Mother was entitled to
under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate. For the purposes of these
proceedings, the parties’ interest in Father’s estate was limited
to the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Plaintiffs further claimed that it was then suggested – and all family
members agreed – that the four children would “defer” their interest in
the Property until Mother passed away (the “Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It
was not clear what that meant, legally. Nevertheless, it was clear,
on the Plaintiffs’ case, that the consequence of the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement was that the Property would be transferred into Mother’s
sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dawood’s 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Dawood,
however, had his own version of an agreement that was vastly different
from the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. In his version (“Dawood’s 2004
Agreement”), Dawood asked all his siblings, in early January 2004,
to gather at the Property to discuss the administration of Father’s
estate. At this meeting, which was also attended by Mother, Dawood
informed the family that they needed to engage a lawyer to assist in
the application for letters of administration. The family agreed
that Dawood should be responsible for this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Dawood
claimed that the family also agreed, at the same meeting, that the
Property should be registered in the joint names of Mother and him. Dawood
said that the Plaintiffs agreed to this as he was the only unmarried child
then, and was also the only one living with Mother at that time.
As part of this agreement, Dawood would take care of Mother and
pay all household and related bills. There was also a suggestion
that this entire arrangement – the ownership of the Property and
taking care of Mother – was in line with Father’s wishes. I will
return to this suggestion in due course (see [155] to [161] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Transfer of the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Leaving
aside for now whether and which of the two agreements reflected
the true situation, the Property was eventually transferred to and registered
in Mother and Dawood’s names as joint tenants. This took place following
the execution of various documents. The principal documents relating
to the transfer are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest dated 27 February 2004
under which Jahir, Asyha and Noorjahan renounced all interest in
the Property in favour of Mother and Dawood;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
Transmission Application No IUA 72518P dated 29 March 2005 for the
Property to be transmitted to Dawood as the sole administrator of
Father’s estate; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
Transfer Document No IA 72519A dated 29 March 2005 and registered
on 15 April 2005 under which the Property was transferred from Dawood
as the administrator to Mother and Dawood as joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It
appeared that the new certificate of title and the completed administration
papers were returned by Messrs Harjeet Singh &amp; Co to Dawood
sometime in May 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
Plaintiffs claimed that they were never given or shown the original
certificate of title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discovery of the transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
Plaintiffs claimed that they only discovered that the Property had been
transferred to Mother and Dawood as joint tenants sometime in the beginning
of 2011; in other words, 11 years after the demise of Father, and almost
six years after Mother and Dawood became joint tenants of the Property.
This was prompted, the Plaintiffs said, by Mother’s request to see the
title deed. Aysha then approached a friend who was a lawyer, one
Mr Ibrahim, who did a search of the land registry and informed her
that Mother and Dawood were joint tenants of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It
was not clear what immediate steps the Plaintiffs took after they found
out about the joint tenancy from Mr Ibrahim. In any event, according
to Aysha, Mr Ibrahim told her (when she subsequently approached
him for advice) that she should lodge a caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Aysha
thus suggested to Jahir and Noorjahan that they should lodge a caveat.
They agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On
15 November 2011, Mr Ibrahim filed a caveat on the Property on behalf
of the Plaintiff Siblings (“the Caveat”). The Caveat alleged that Dawood,
as the administrator of Father’s estate, had no right to gift the Property
to himself and Mother to the exclusion of the interests of the caveators
(that is, the Plaintiff Siblings). Although Mother was not listed
as a caveator, there was no dispute that she was aware and had implicitly consented
to the filing of the Caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Dawood
was notified of the filing of the Caveat by way of a letter from the
Singapore Land Authority (SLA) on 19 November 2011. However, he did
not take steps to set aside the Caveat. Dawood said that he spoke
to Aysha and Jahir and asked them why they had lodged the Caveat
but they avoided giving him a proper answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Dawood
said that he also asked Mother about the Caveat to which she said
that the Plaintiff Siblings “just wanted some money”. According
to Dawood, Mother said she would talk to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">These proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On
13 February 2013, the Plaintiffs instructed solicitors to issue
a letter of demand to Dawood alleging that he had breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004
Agreement by registering the Property in the joint names of Mother and
him. The letter gave Dawood until 20 February 2013 to remove his name
as a joint owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After
an initial holding letter, Dawood’s solicitors responded on 14 March
2013 denying the existence of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Shortly
thereafter, on 27 March 2013, the Plaintiffs commenced these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In
essence, the Plaintiffs claimed that by transferring the Property
to Mother and himself as joint tenants “surreptitiously and/or in
bad faith”, Dawood had breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement which
was an agreement between the four siblings to “waive all or any
interest in the estate, particularly in relation to the Property
and name [Mother] as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the
Property”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
Plaintiffs also challenged the “authenticity of the probate papers”, not
so much that they were forged, but in the sense that irrespective
of what the documents said, the Plaintiffs thought that the documents
that they had signed were for the purpose of giving effect to the
Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
Plaintiffs sought the following substantive reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     a
declaration that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner of
the Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
declaration that Dawood has no legal or beneficial interest in the
Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     Transfer
Document No IA 72519A dated 25 March 2009 and registered on 15 April
2005 is null and void; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dawood
to deliver possession of all title deeds relating to the Property,
sign all documents and deeds necessary to register Mother as the
sole legal and beneficial owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dawood’s pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Dawood’s
main defence was that the Plaintiff Siblings had, under the Deed
of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest, waived all of their legal
and beneficial interests in Father’s estate in favour of Mother
and himself. He claimed that their renunciation was in furtherance
of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Dawood
also claimed that to the extent that the Plaintiffs alleged that there
was an implied contract, that is, the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,
the cause of action arising from the registration of the Property
with Mother and Dawood as joint tenants accrued on 15 April 2005
(see [25(c)] above). Pursuant to s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap
163, 1996 Rev Ed) – which limits the prosecution of contractual
claims to six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued
– the Plaintiffs’ claim was therefore time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thirdly,
Dawood counterclaimed that the Plaintiff Siblings’ lodgement of
the Caveat was wrongful, vexatious or without reasonable cause.
Dawood therefore sought damages for losses that he had incurred
in relation to the lodgement of the Caveat, namely costs of obtaining
legal advice and costs associated with obtaining a copy of the Caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     If
however the court found that the Plaintiff Siblings did have a legitimate
interest in the Property, Dawood counterclaimed for a declaration
that the Plaintiff Siblings are liable, in proportion to their respective
interests in the Property, for the costs and expenses related to
the administration of Father’s estate and the upkeep of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Based
on the parties’ respective pleadings and submissions, it was common
ground that the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to their reliefs, in particular the
claims for declarations that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial
owner of the Property and that Dawood has no legal or beneficial
interest in the Property, were predicated entirely on my finding
in relation to the issue of whether Dawood had, on the Plaintiff’s
case, breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. Although the question
of ownership and title to the Property was governed by the provisions
of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed), both sides were content
to rest the dispute on the issue of whether Dawood had breached
the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. Both sides accordingly made no submissions
on whether the provisions in the Land Titles Act had any bearing
on the declarations sought. I proceeded on that same footing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Thus,
the issues before me were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the Plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     if
the Plaintiffs’ claim was not time-barred, which of the two agreements
– the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement or Dawood’s 2004 Agreement – was
concluded and binding;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     if
the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was concluded and binding, whether
Dawood, in transferring the Property to Mother and his joint names,
had breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     finally,
whether the lodgement of the Caveat was wrongful, vexatious or otherwise
without reasonable cause and if so, what were the consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Plaintiffs’ claim
was time-barred</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable provision in
the Limitation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Throughout
their pleadings, the Plaintiffs’ referred to the Plaintiffs’ 2004
Agreement by a somewhat confusing description – “representation and/or
understanding and/or agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This
description was all important because Dawood’s defence was that
the Plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act
but s 6 only applies if the Plaintiffs’ claim can be properly characterised
as one founded in contract or tort (there are other categories but
they clearly do not apply).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
my view, the cause of action disclosed by the pleadings was an action
for breach of contract. The Plaintiffs’ principal claim was that
there had been a Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement which Dawood breached
by transferring the Property to Mother and himself under a joint
tenancy. This was a plain vanilla contract claim. Although the Statement
of Claim had used words such as “representation” or “understanding”,
these were used synonymously with the word “agreement” in the contractual
sense and not as self-standing elements of a different cause of
action. In any event, I did not think that the pleadings disclosed
any other cause of action outside of contract or tort. For that
reason, s 6 was applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I
did not agree with Mr Sahagar’s submission that s 6 of the Limitation
Act did not apply because the Plaintiffs’ claim was an action to recover
land (which under s 9 has a 12-year limitation period) or, alternatively,
a claim to any share of Father’s estate (which under s 23 has no
limitation period).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     First,
s 9 of the Limitation Act applies to cases involving a cause of action
for the recovery of land that is premised on an existing proprietary right.
For example, Steven Chong J in the High Court case of <em>Teh Siew Hua v Tan Kim Chiong</em> [2010] 4
SLR 123 noted at [40] that s 9 is concerned with an action by a
person with legal title to the land against an adverse possessor.
In another High Court case, <em>Tay Tuan Kiat </em><em>and another v Pritnam Singh Brar</em> [1985-1986]
SLR(R) 763, L P Thean J considered a claim for an order to demolish
an existing retaining wall and to build a new wall in its place
but in a different location, as falling within s 9 because it gave
the plaintiff possession of a portion of property that had been encroached
upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     A
breach of an agreement over the administration and division of an estate
is not a cause of action for the recovery of land premised on an existing
proprietary right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Accordingly,
the Plaintiffs’ claim was not governed by s 9 of the Limitation
Act to the exclusion of s 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As
for Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission that the Plaintiffs’ claim was
a claim for a share or interest in Father’s estate, I did not agree
with this submission either because the pleadings plainly did not
disclose such a cause of action. Although the Property concerned
was at one point part of Father’s estate, there was no averment
to the effect that the Plaintiffs were entitled to a general or
specific share of Father’s estate either by way of a will or under
relevant intestacy laws. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, counsel for Dawood
(“Mr Zhulkarnain”), rightly pointed out that there could not be
a claim to Father’s estate because, on the Plaintiffs’ own case,
they already each had an interest in Father’s estate; it was those
very interests which they had given up to Mother (on the Plaintiffs’
case) under the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. The
remedies sought by the Plaintiffs (see [39] above) were also inconsistent
with a claim to a share of Father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Accordingly,
the Plaintiffs’ claim was not governed by s 23 of the Limitation
Act to the exclusion of s 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Further reasons against time-bar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr
Sahagar gave two further reasons why the claim was not time-barred,
notwithstanding the operation of s 6 of the Limitation Act. First, equity
will not allow a statute to be used to further a fraud. Secondly,
the commencement of the limitation period was postponed by s 29
of the Limitation Act because there was fraud involved which could
not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. I will discuss
these two reasons in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Equity will not allow
a statute to be used to further a fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr
Sahagar had misunderstood the application of the maxim which he
had taken from <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol
9(2) (LexisNexis, 2003) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”)
at para 110.014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The
purpose of the rule that equity will not permit a statute to be
used as an engine of fraud, as stated in the same paragraph of the
same volume of <em>Halsbury’s</em>, is to
provide a means of escape for a deserving plaintiff who has failed
to comply with prescribed formalities, a failure which would ordinarily
render the transaction unenforceable at law. Prescribed formalities
refer to rules requiring, for example, a declaration of trust over land
to be evidenced by a memorandum signed by the person able to declare
it; an assignment of an equitable interest to be effected in writing
by the person disposing of it; or a contract for the sale of land
to be evidenced by writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Ostensibly,
the maxim had no application to the present case, and certainly
not in the way that Mr Sahagar submitted it should apply, that is, to
preclude the application of s 6 of the Limitation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In
summary, save for s 29 of the Limitation Act, all the other exceptions
raised by Mr Sahagar to postpone the limitation period under s 6 of
did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Postponement of the
commencement of the limitation period by s 29 of the Limitation
Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
argument here was that because of Dawood’s surreptitious transfer
of the Property, his breach of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement remained
concealed until 2011 when Aysha learnt of the ownership of the Property
from Mr Ibrahim. Accordingly, pursuant to s 29(1)(<em>b</em>)
of the Limitation Act, which postpones the limitation period in
cases where the right of action is concealed by the fraud of the
defendant, the six-year limitation period only started running from
the time the Plaintiffs discovered the fraud, that is, 2011. On
this basis, the Plaintiffs’ commencement of proceedings in 2013
was therefore well within the limitation period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It
is a prerequisite of s 29(1)(<em>b</em>)
of the Limitation Act that the “right of action is concealed by
the fraud of [the defendant]”. In other words, at the minimum, the
Plaintiffs had to show that Dawood had “knowingly or recklessly
committed a wrongdoing in secret without telling [the Plaintiffs]” (see <em>Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association
v Herman Iskandar</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 848 (“<em>Bank
of America</em>”) at [73]–[75] which was cited with approval
by the Court of Appeal in <em>Chua Teck Chew Robert
v Goh Eng Wah</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 716 (“<em>Goh
Eng Wah</em>”) at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     To
address this issue, it was necessary to descend into the facts.
Unlike most of the other pleas of limitation periods which are typically
disposed of as a preliminary issue by way of a summary judgment
application (see Andrew McGee, <em>Limitation Periods</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 2005) (“<em>McGee</em>”) at para
21.007), the specific issue of the postponement of the limitation
period because of fraud and concealment is, in some cases, unsuitable
for preliminary determination. This is because the question of fraud
and concealment, which further brings into question the plaintiff’s
diligence in discovering the fraud or concealment, often turns on
the proving of a myriad of facts which are hotly contested: see
for <em>eg</em>, <em>Bank
America</em> and <em>Goh Eng Wah</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Less
apparent are situations where the issue of postponement of the limitation
period may be moot as a result the court’s findings and holdings in
relation to the cause of action which is said to be infected by
the same fraudulent conduct that concealed the cause of action from
the plaintiff. The present case is one such example. Here, the very
basis of the postponement of the limitation period, Dawood’s alleged
fraudulent conduct in relation to the transfer of the Property,
was founded on the same alleged factual matrix supporting the Plaintiffs’
claim for breach of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     My
findings on the evidence in relation to that factual matrix were therefore
determinative of both the main cause of action, as well as the limitation
period issue. Notwithstanding, it is important to note that in such
cases, both the merits and the limitation period issues have been determined.
This distinction is important because generally, the effect of a holding
that an action is time-barred by a limitation period is the action may
not be brought in <em>that</em> court, even
though the right to bring the cause of action is not extinguished
(see <em>McGee</em> at para 1.008), whereas
the holding that the cause of action is dismissed on the merits
renders that cause of action determined and hence subject to the
usual <em>res judicata</em> principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Although
Mr Sahagar’s submissions refer specifically to s 29(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Limitation Act. I noted that
the factual matrix alleged by the Plaintiffs may also fall within
s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Limitation Act,
which similarly postpones the limitation period where the cause
of action is based on fraud of the defendant. For the avoidance
of doubt, the views that I have expressed above (at [61] to [64])
apply to an argument based on s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) as
well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For
the above reasons, I shall reserve articulation of my decision on the
postponement of the limitation period on account of s 29(1) of the Limitation
Act until after I have described the factual controversies and given
my findings in relation to those controversies (see [163] to [168] below).
I turn to these now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Which of the two agreements
was concluded and binding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There
were three possibilities: (a) the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was concluded
and binding; (b) Dawood’s 2004 Agreement was concluded and binding;
or (c) there was no agreement concluded on the terms of either agreement.
These were all mutually incompatible options. Largely due to the
paucity of consistent and credible evidence, it was difficult to
determine which of the three options reflected the true situation
in 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In
the end, the decision on the existence and validity of the various agreements
came down to a rather technical (and some might say, unpalatable
principle) – he who alleges bears the burden of proof. I was not convinced
that either side had proven that their version of the agreement was
the true agreement. In my view, it was more likely that agreement
on the ownership of the Property was never properly discussed and
concluded. All that can be said – and all that matters as far as
the present proceedings were concerned – was that the parties executed
certain documents which in their nature had the effect of transferring
of the Property to Dawood and Mother as joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I
shall explain the reasons for my conclusion, beginning with the problems
with the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Lack of particulars
of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As
alluded to above, I found several aspects of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement
troubling. The first concerned the details of the formation of this
agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The
cornerstone of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was a meeting in which
the Plaintiffs and Dawood consented to the arrangement for the Property
to be conveyed into Mother’s sole name. Yet, despite the importance
of this meeting, none of the Plaintiffs gave or could give particulars
of the meeting, including for instance, when the meeting took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     All
four affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs” or “AEIC”) by the Plaintiffs
only provided vague references to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement being
formed four years after Father’s death. It is apposite to mention,
here, that the combined length of all four of the Plaintiffs’ AEICs
(excluding exhibits) was a measly 39 pages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Nevertheless,
because the reason given by the Plaintiffs for the Plaintiffs’ 2004
Agreement was their surprise at how small Mother’s share of the
Property was under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate (which was issued on
24 February 2004), it can be inferred that this meeting which led
to the conclusion of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement took place only
on or after 24 February 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The
fact that a meeting took place was not even mentioned in the Plaintiffs’
affidavits. It only came to light during Aysha’s cross-examination, though
she could not recall the date of the meeting. She said that the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement “took place” during a meeting one afternoon at the
Property. By “took place” I understood her to mean “was formed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Parties present at
this meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     When
asked who amongst the parties were present, she said “Dawood, myself,
my mum”. She could not remember whether Jahir was there; she was
certain, though, that Noorjahan was not. In his own testimony, Jahir
said that he was not present at this meeting. Jahir claimed that
he had not seen Dawood throughout the relevant time. In fact, Jahir’s evidence
was that he did not have sight of the 2nd Inheritance Certificate
at the time that he allegedly agreed to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Therein
lay the problem. For the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement to have been
concluded, Jahir, Dawood, Aysha and Noorjahan must have offered
to waive their interests in favour of Mother and simultaneously
accepted the offer by the others to do the same. Aysha said she
called Noorjahan during the meeting to inform Noorjahan of the contents
of the 2nd Inheritance Certificate, and that according to the lawyer
that Dawood consulted, if the children wanted Mother to be the sole
owner, each child had to give up his or her respective interest
to Mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I
was not sure whether such a conversation took place but there were other
problems even if I could accept that the conversation did take place. The
most obvious problem was the continued absence of Jahir. It was
never established when or how Jahir came to be part of this Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement. He was not present at the alleged meeting, and neither
was he informed through a call in the same way that Noorjahan apparently
was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Jahir
agreed to the suggestion put to him by Mr Zhulkarnain that he did
not “know whether Dawood agreed to the [Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement]”.
At minimum, there was no offer and acceptance as between Jahir and
Dawood. It is worth pausing here to note that if there was no agreement
between Jahir, who is one of the Plaintiffs, and Dawood, it was difficult
to find in favour of the Plaintiffs’ submission that there was a Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Jahir
seemed to me to be ignorant of the salient features of his own case,
in particular, details of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. He even candidly
admitted that much of what he had allegedly “agreed” to, or knew about
(in relation to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement) came from Aysha
and Noorjahan. That admission could be read in a number of ways.
Suffice to say, I did not think Jahir had any material or significant
part to play in this Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     More
than that, Jahir even made statements that contradicted what the
other Plaintiffs were saying. For example, in direct opposition
to Aysha’s evidence (see [74] above), he said that the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement was reached “following several conversations between
the siblings and our mother”. Just on the basis of Jahir’s involvement
(or the lack thereof) and his evidence on what transpired alone,
I thought that the Plaintiffs’ case for the existence of the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement was rather weak.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Problems with Aysha’s
testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     There
was a more serious issue. Aysha’s testimony (at [76] above) was internally
incoherent. According to her, Dawood produced the 2nd Inheritance
Certificate for the first time in the same meeting where the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement was formed. She testified that it was <em>only </em><em>then</em> that
the Plaintiffs – or at least Mother and her – found out about the respective
interests each person was entitled to under Syariah law. If this meeting
was the first time that Mother and her knew about the shares that each
family member was entitled to, and hence there could not have been any
understanding prior to this meeting that the children were going
to give their shares to Mother, why would Dawood have sought legal
advice as to how Mother could inherit the entire Property? This
part of Aysha’s testimony simply did not make sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Given
that the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was only formed at this meeting
at the earliest, Dawood had no reason to take pre-emptive steps
to find out how the children could transfer their interests to Mother
to enable her to be the sole owner of the Property during her lifetime,
as Aysha claimed. Mother had not known of her relatively small share
before she was shown the 2nd Inheritance Certificate at this meeting.
Jahir, Aysha and Noorjahan, too, did not know how much their respective
shares would be. Dawood therefore could not have known before this
meeting that the Plaintiffs wanted to transfer their shares to Mother
because her share was the smallest compared to theirs. Accordingly,
Dawood did not have any reason to and would not have asked Mr Singh
how Mother can be the sole owner of the Property notwithstanding
the 2nd Inheritance Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Problems with Mother’s
testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There
was also Mother’s testimony which went against the Plaintiffs’ 2004
Agreement. Although some leeway ought to be given to Mother’s ability
to recall events given her advanced age, I could not ignore or discount
her positive assertion during cross-examination that she had told Dawood
to transfer the house to her name after Father passed away, and that
Dawood had agreed to her request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     If
this were true, then it was Mother’s idea that the Property be transferred
to her sole name. This was not in any of the Plaintiffs’ AEICs, nor
was this alluded to in the Statement of Claim. Mother made no mention of
this in her own AEIC. To the contrary, her evidence there was significantly
more passive – “[f]rom what I recall, the children agreed to defer
the division of the house [until] after I pass[ed] away”. This can
also be interpreted uncharitably as a point of inconsistency between
her affidavit and oral evidence regarding the source of the instruction
for the transfer of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     There
were a few other different motives given in the AEICs of the Plaintiff
Siblings, chief of which was that the children had out of filial
piety agreed to give up their interests to Mother because she had
received the smallest share under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate.
This was also the reason given by Noorjahan in her oral testimony.
Aysha’s affidavit evidence suggested yet another reason for the
transfer – transferring ownership of the house into everyone’s respective
shares required much more paperwork and would have incurred unnecessary
stamp fees and legal costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Problems with Noorjahan’s
testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Apart
from the discrepancy relating to the motives for the transfer of the
Property between the testimony of Noorjahan and that of Mother (compare
[83], [84] and [85] above), Noorjahan’s testimony departed from the
others in at least one other material aspect. When asked how she
knew that all the siblings had agreed to the terms of the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement, she said that that was what Aysha had communicated
to her in the phone call that was made in that meeting with Dawood
where everyone first found out about the shares under the 2nd Inheritance
Certificate (see [76] above). Noorjahan specifically said that she
agreed to give up her share to Mother as well because Aysha had
told her that “[the] brothers were okay with it”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     This
was incorrect. Jahir was not at the meeting. This was in Jahir’s testimony
and the testimony of Aysha, and there was no suggestion by Aysha
that she had called Jahir to ask him for his opinion. In fact, Aysha’s own
evidence was that on the day that Dawood showed Mother and her the 2nd
Inheritance Certificate, she could not recall whether Jahir had
agreed. It was therefore not likely that Aysha would have said that
the brothers, that is, Jahir and Dawood, had approved of the Plaintiffs’
2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   The Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Perhaps
most critical of all, the Plaintiffs had to explain away the Deed
of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which flatly contradicts
the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     At
this juncture, it has to be emphasised that the Plaintiffs acknowledged
that they had signed this deed. At no point did the Plaintiffs dispute
the authenticity of their signatures on any of the relevant documents
that they had signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The
Plaintiffs’ sole dispute in relation to the documents was the manner
of execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On
that premise, the Plaintiffs had to explain why the Plaintiff Siblings
had signed the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which clearly
stated that they were waiving their interest in favour of Mother
and Dawood. Another discrepancy that required explanation was why
the Plaintiffs did not consider it odd that Dawood did not sign
the same document if it were clearly their agreement that the four
children were to waive their interests in favour of Mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The
Plaintiffs’ explanation for both discrepancies was essentially the same,
which is that Dawood had deceived them into signing the Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest. In the main, the Plaintiffs’ claimed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     they
had signed various documents at different times and at different
places – some in the Solicitors’ office, but others at home;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     they
were mostly only given – either by Dawood or the Solicitors – the
signature pages of each document to sign;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     there
was never any explanation by anyone, including the Solicitors, as
to the nature and contents of the documents; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     they
had signed whatever that was presented to them unquestioningly because
they had assumed that Dawood was carrying out the Plaintiffs’ 2004
Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     All
of the above were of course denied by Dawood, as well as the Solicitors.
The Solicitors asserted that the Plaintiffs had signed the relevant documents
in the Solicitors’ office, and only after the contents and implications
of the documents had been explained by Mr Singh to the Plaintiffs.
Dawood corroborated this assertion with further evidence that he had
accompanied the Plaintiffs at various times to the Solicitors’ office
to sign the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Specifically,
in the case of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which
was signed on 27 February 2004, the evidence of the Solicitors was
that the Plaintiff Siblings had attended at their office, were informed
by Mr Singh in English of the nature and implication of this deed, and
that they had signed this deed only after Mr Singh’s explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Another
deed was also signed on 27 February 2004. This was the Deed of Renunciation
of Persons with Equal Rights. Under this deed, the four Plaintiffs
agreed to renounce their right to letters of administration of Father’s
estate, which effectively meant that Dawood was solely responsible for
the administration of Father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Ms
Kaur was very clear in her evidence that Mr Singh and she had explained
to the Plaintiffs that the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest
and the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights were two
different documents. She said there was “no hint of disharmony or dissent
of any sort between the family members” and that the Plaintiffs simply
agreed and nodded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Limiting
the issue to the signing of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest (as this was the most crucial document), the diametrically
opposed evidence from both sides could in my view be resolved by
the determination of just one question: whose testimony – that of
the Plaintiffs on one side or that of Dawood and the Solicitors
on the other – relating to the Plaintiffs’ visit to the Solicitors’
office on 27 February 2004 was more credible?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     This
was the lynchpin of both sides’ evidence because either the Plaintiffs
were right and that not all of them were present on 27 February 2004
(in which case Dawood and the Solicitors were all lying and everything
thereon could not be believed), or conversely, the Plaintiffs were all
present on 27 February 2004 (which meant that the Plaintiffs were
all lying about signing single signature pages at home, with the
corollary that Dawood and the Solicitors were telling the truth).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Although
I am cognisant of the firm rule of evidence that the evidence of
a witness ought not to be rejected completely simply because the
witness was unreliable or untrue in some parts, recently emphasised
by the Court of Appeal in <em>Alwie </em><em>Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal</em> [2013]
4 SLR 308 at [59]–[61], both sides had organised their case and
mustered their evidence on an all-or-nothing basis – the entire
case theory put forward by either side on the circumstances surrounding
the signing of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest had
to be accepted or rejected in full. There was no room for any middle
ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In
my judgment, for the following reasons, I found Dawood, Mr Singh
and Ms Kaur’s combined testimony that the Plaintiffs were all present
in the Solicitors’ office on 27 February 2004 to be more credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Inconsistencies in
the Plaintiffs’ version of events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Mother’s
evidence was that she had only been to the Solicitors’ office once,
and that she was accompanied by Aysha and Dawood on that single visit.
She could not recall the date but she could recall very clearly
that she arrived at the Solicitors’ office in the afternoon, specifically,
at 2pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Dawood’s
evidence was that the appointment was at 3pm. Mother and Aysha both
said that it was Dawood who brought them to the Solicitors’ office
on 27 February 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Mother
could remember certain things but not others. For example, she recalled
the following: she had signed only one document that day; she was
the first to sign that document; the signing took place in a room
in the office; and she left the room after signing. When asked if
Mr Singh was in the room, her response was “there were a few girls[,]
similar to what it is here in the room”. I understood her to mean
that the number of people present in the Solicitors’ office was
similar to what she was seeing in court at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Pausing
here, at least two of her above recollections were curious. The first
was the number of documents that she remembered signing. In her AEIC,
her evidence was that she had “signed <em>some</em> documents”
during the sole visit she made to the Solicitors’ office. Apart
from that, it was also strange that Mother remembered that there
were “a few girls” in the room where she signed the document(s).
Although Aysha did not say whether there were others in that room
where the signing took place, her testimony was that she had stood
outside the room when Mother was signing as the “room was small”.
If Aysha was outside, and Noorjahan was not present, who were these
girls that Mother was referring to? Even accounting for Ms Kaur’s
presence, Mother’s recollection that there were “a few girls” in
the room did not accord with the other parts of hers and/or Aysha’s testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I
could not rule out the possibility that Mother was describing the main
office where some other secretaries were seated and not the room where
the signing took place but that would only lend weight to the suggestion
that Mother’s recollection was, at best, hazy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Moreover,
despite being able to remember certain details, Mother was unsure
of a number of other details, including key details such as whether Aysha
had signed the document at all, where Aysha was when she (Mother) signed
and after she (Mother) had signed, whether Mr Singh was present
in the room; and whether it was the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest
or the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights that she had
signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In
the light of the above, I found Mother’s evidence to be, on the whole,
unhelpful and unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    There
was no basis for me to accept only evidence that she could recall and
to dismiss the fact that she was unable to recall other important
details as inconsequential. If the details that she had forgotten
were incidental to the execution of the documents, I might have
considered her memory lapses unimportant. However, the details that
she could not remember were vital. Her inability to recall vital
details immediately called into question her reliability as a witness
of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I
was mindful of my role which was to separate the wheat from the chaff
but there are situations when the wheat and chaff are so inextricably intertwined
that it would be unwise and unsafe to attempt to distil fact from fiction.
Mother’s evidence was one such instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I
turn now to Aysha’s evidence since she claimed that she was the
only other of the Plaintiffs to have been present in the Solicitors’
office on 27 February 2004. Aysha confirmed that Mr Singh was in
the room when she and Mother signed the document(s). However, she
and Mother were not in the room at the same time when the other
was signing. Aysha only signed after Mother had signed and left
the room. This was at least consistent with Mother’s testimony the
day before. Aysha also confirmed – both in her AEIC and during cross-examination
– that she had signed on more than one sheet of paper; in other
words, she signed on at least two (if not more sheets) of paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    As
only two documents – the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interests
and the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights – were signed
and dated 27 February 2004, Aysha must have signed those two documents
when she attended the Solicitors’ office even if she could not recall
or claimed not to know what she had signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Hence,
the only remaining question that was relevant was whether Aysha’s
evidence that she was only given single pages to sign without any accompanying
explanation from either Mr Singh or Ms Kaur was credible. Even leaving
aside evidence to the contrary from Mr Singh, Ms Kaur and Dawood,
I did not think that it was likely that Aysha had only been given the
signature page of the relevant documents to sign, nor was it likely
that she had signed single pages without inquiring both as to the
earlier pages of the documents as well as the nature and implications
of what she was signing. I shall explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    First,
it did not make sense for Mr Singh (he had primary carriage over
the matter) to only show the signature page to Mother and Aysha
– why would he do that? Just from a common sense perspective, it
seemed more troublesome to separate a two-page document only to
recombine the pages after the signature page had been signed by
the relevant signatories. Mr Singh had no reason to inconvenience
himself in this manner. Factor in Mr Singh’s professional standing
as a senior lawyer with more than 30 years in practice and as a
Commissioner of Oaths, it would have been extremely risky for him
to have only presented the signature pages to Mother and Aysha without
the accompanying first page, which sets out the gist of the document
that was being signed. In the absence of any ulterior motive – there
was no suggestion of a conspiracy between Dawood and the Solicitors to
cheat the Plaintiffs – I found that scenario most improbable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Second,
the signature page of both deeds begged questions to be asked. The
signature page of the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal
Rights began with:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">right and title to Letters of Administration
of the Estate of the said deceased.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    On
their own, the words at the beginning of the signature page made no
sense whatsoever. The normal, reasonable reaction would be to either ask
to see the previous page to verify that the words were part of a
sentence in the previous page, or to have asked for an explanation
from the person who prepared the document what that sentence meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    On
Aysha’s evidence, she did neither of those. On her evidence, Mother
too did neither of those. Perhaps one person might have been lax, but
two people failing to do what was the most logical and natural thing
to do, beggared belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Likewise,
the first words on the signature page of the Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest were complete nonsense on their own:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In
fact, “[Mother] and the said Dawood” was clearly even more meaningless
than “right and title to Letters of Administration of the Estate of
the said deceased” (see [114] above). No person who had enough mental faculties
to know that she was in a lawyer’s office signing legal documents would
have signed either, much less both, pages without any attempt to
find out more about the documents, unless of course the documents
had already been explained by someone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Furthermore,
the signatures required in the Deed of Beneficial Interest were
palpably different from the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with
Equal Rights. The absence of Mother’s signature or the need for
it was glaringly obvious. Aysha must have known this. She knew that
Mother was the first to sign the Deed of Renunciation of Persons
with Equal Rights which meant that she must have noticed Mother’s
signature there. She ought therefore to have noticed the absence
of Mother’s signature in the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest, and that would have been of some interest to her, at the
very least: why did Mother not sign this other document?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Thirdly,
even if Aysha had not paid attention to the incomprehensible words
at the beginning, she must have wondered what this other document, one
that did not require Mother’s signature, was about. This would have prompted
her to at least ask for the previous page, or perhaps more directly, to
ask Mr Singh or Dawood for clarification. Again, on her own case,
she did neither. She simply signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    It
is apposite to address a point made persistently by Mr Sahagar in his
submissions. He harped on the fact that Father’s name had been misspelt
in a number of the documents executed in the course of the administration
of the estate. In relation to the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest, the mistake was a missing “Mohamed” in the first page of
the document. The Father’s name was wrongly written as “Kamaldi
Bin Aboobabkar @ Mohamed Aboobakar Kamaldin” instead of “Kamaldi
Bin Mohamed Aboobakar @ Mohamed Aboobakar Kamaldin”. Mr Sahagar submitted
that if the Plaintiffs did have sight of the first page of this
deed where the error was initially made, they would certainly have
spotted the error. Hence, the fact that the error was not spotted
supported the assertion that the Plaintiffs were not given the first
page of the deed before being asked to sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr
Sahagar’s argument was, to me, an exercise in creating a mountain out
of a molehill. I was not as sure as he was that the Plaintiffs would
have spotted the error. On the Plaintiffs’ own case, for the reasons
that I have mentioned at [114] to [120] above, Mother and Aysha
were not exactly the most observant or inquisitive people. If they
could miss the numerous red flags that were screaming to be discovered
(on their own testimony they were only shown the signature pages),
I very much doubt that they would have spotted the error in the
spelling of Father’s name. Father’s name is neither simple nor short.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Even
on my finding that the Plaintiffs were present in the Solicitors’ office,
I was not convinced that just because there was an error, it must
be inferred that the Plaintiffs did not see the first page. They
could have seen it but thought nothing of it because it was evidently
clear that notwithstanding the misspelt name, the person referred
to was Father and no one else. After all, Father’s NRIC number was
written on the same page, and more importantly, the only interests
that they could possibly renounce was their interest in Father’s
estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The documentary evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The
Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest was accompanied at the
end by a declaration by Mr Singh that the signatories had voluntarily signed
the documents in his presence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Similarly,
the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Right ended with
Mr Singh acknowledging with his signature that the signatories had
signed the document before him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Therefore,
on the face of the two documents, the relevant Plaintiffs had signed
them in the presence of Mr Singh. The only theory that accommodates
this fact is Dawood’s theory – that all the Plaintiffs had attended
at the Solicitors’ office. On the Plaintiffs’ case, Mr Singh’s declaration
and acknowledgement in the two deeds were misleading because Mr
Singh was not present at all times when the documents were signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    All
the Plaintiffs had by way of supporting evidence was their oral testimony
that Jahir and Noorjahan were not present when Mother and Aysha
signed the documents, and that Jahir and Noorjahan had signed the documents
in the Property at other times when Mr Singh was not around. At
the same time, the Plaintiffs could not give direct and clear evidence
of the circumstances surrounding Jahir and Noorjahan’s signing of
the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    For
example, Jahir said he could not recall whether the others had signed
the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights before he signed
it, nor could he recall whether Mr Singh had already pre-acknowledged
that the signatories had signed the document in his presence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Noorjahan
was slightly better. She recalled being the last to sign both the
Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights and the Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest. She also recalled not seeing Mr Singh’s signature
acknowledging that the signatories had signed in his presence in both
documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    But
her credibility took a big hit, in my judgment, in her response
to Mr Zhulkarnain’s query whether Noorjahan had asked Mother for
the first page of both documents. Noorjahan replied:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First of all, we never knew there was pages
attached to this signature page, so how are we to know what page
– how many pages is – we – we are supposed to have for this sign
document and how many pages we are supposed to have for this signatory
page?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It
was almost as if Noorjahan had been rehearsing her lyrics for a song.
The only snag, though, was that she had sung at a wrong time. It
was incredible, in my view, that she could genuinely have thought
that the signature page was the only page of the two documents that
she had appended her signature to. I have already made the same
observation in relation to Mother and Aysha above, but this was
even more egregious. Here we have a sibling who had all the time
during her visiting of Mother to look through the documents before
signing. Yet, her evidence was that it did not occur to her that
the two signature pages (see [114] and [117] above) were part of
a document which had more than one page. That view was simply not
credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The
shift in Noorjahan’s testimony which occurred just moments later
was also telling. Now, instead of saying that she could not have
known if the signature page was preceded by other pages, Noorjahan
essentially said that she had signed because all her family members
had signed. To my mind, Noorjahan recognised that she had misspoken.
Again, the exchange merits full reproduction:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay.
But would you agree that there should be something in front of this
[signature] page?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Because
at that point, it didn’t matter to me who has signed the document.
It was all my family members who have sign the documents.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Whether my mum have sign, or Dawood
has sign, I wouldn’t know who – only the lawyers would know what
are the – who are the people who should be signing this document.
So we went ahead with that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Accordingly,
I was not persuaded that the oral testimony of the Plaintiffs did
enough to contradict the documentary evidence that Mr Singh was
present when the Plaintiffs signed the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with
Equal Rights and the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The Solicitors’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    I
turn then to the evidence by the Solicitors. Both were consistent
in their evidence that the Plaintiffs were all present at the Solicitors’
office on 27 February 2004, were informed by Mr Singh in English
of the nature and implications of the various documents that the
Plaintiffs were about to sign, and the Plaintiffs signed these documents
voluntarily and without demur. I did not have any good reason to
disbelieve their evidence, especially in the light of the significant
issues that I had with the coherence and reliability of the Plaintiffs’
evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The
Solicitors’ evidence appealed more to me partly because of their ability
to recall specific details. For instance, Mr Singh recalled that
Mother understood English which was why he did not have to explain
the documents in Tamil. Mother denied that she understood English
but based on my own observations after her cross-examination, notwithstanding
that a translator was present, I was convinced that she could understand
basic English. From Mr Singh’s brief re-enactment of the explanation
of the documents, I was satisfied that his explanation was simple
enough even for lay people with a very basic command of the English
language to understand. Mr Singh also recalled that the atmosphere
in the office was “very friendly and cordial”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    But
it was the Solicitors’ recollection of the personalities of the
various Plaintiffs that struck me most. Mr Singh said that Aysha,
Noorjahan and Dawood were the “chattier ones” whereas Jahir was
rather “quiet” and “simple”. What was more impressive was Mr Singh’s
specific recollection that Noorjahan and Ms Kaur were talking about
Punjabi dresses, and also, that Aysha and Mother had not donned
the Muslim attire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    When
asked by Mr Sahagar how he could remember the Plaintiffs’ traits
after all these years, Mr Singh replied that he just did, but also
because he found the family interesting, in that Dawood looked different
from Jahir. Dawood was suave, authoritative and a tad showy while
Jahir was simple and quiet even though Jahir was the eldest son.
That stuck in his mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Ms
Kaur too gave evidence that Aysha and Noorjahan were chatty and
that Jahir was “a bit quiet”. Ms Kaur also said that when the Plaintiffs first
arrived, she spoke to Mother, Aysha and Noorjahan. They exchanged the
usual pleasantries and Ms Kaur offered her condolences, all in English. At
one point, Ms Kaur said that “the ladies” – that is, herself and
Mother, Aysha and Noorjahan – chatted about “a lot of other things”
that she could not reveal because of legal privilege. In contrast,
Jahir was extremely quiet. That was how she remembered the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I
had no reason to doubt the Solicitors’ evidence which seemed wholly credible.
Mr Sahagar missed the point in his submissions when he stressed that
loquaciousness and talking about Punjabi dresses were not so distinctive
that the Solicitors had any special reason to remember this set
of clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Distinctiveness
may lend special reason to remember an event or persons, but the
absence of it cannot be a positive reason for inferring that a recollection
was not possible. My assessment was that the Solicitors could remember
pockets of what happened because there were things about the Plaintiffs,
both individually and collectively, that caught their attention. Moreover,
the Solicitors continued to interact with some of the Plaintiffs thereafter
in subsequent meetings to sign further documents. The Plaintiffs were
therefore not just clients who came only once and left in a matter
of minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   The allegation of
multiple stapling</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    I
have to deal with a technical evidential point that Mr Sahagar raised. He
stressed that the top left corner of the original Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest was in a relatively damaged state because
it had been stapled, unstapled then re-stapled a number of times.
Mr Singh confirmed during cross-examination that was the case from
the looks of the original copy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The
inference that Mr Sahagar was inviting me to draw was that the damaged
corner of the pages supported his submission that the Plaintiffs only
saw the signature page; the damage had occurred because the pages had
been separated then recombined a number of times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I
declined to draw that inference for two reasons. The first is that
Mr Singh’s explanation for the damaged state of the pages was plausible.
He said that because the amendment to Father’s name was typed into
the first page by a typewriter (it seems), the pages had to be separated.
They were therefore unstapled. Once the amendment was completed,
they were re-stapled together for safekeeping – there would be no
missing pages if all of them were stapled together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In
addition, the three pages of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest
were unstapled when copies were made by Mr Sahagar during inspection
of Mr Singh’s client files for the purposes of these proceedings. Again,
the pages were re-stapled after all the necessary photocopying was completed.
I had no basis to doubt or disagree with Mr Singh’s explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The
second wrinkle in Mr Sahagar’s argument was that his argument was,
to some extent, self-defeating. Taking his argument at its highest,
if Dawood had intended to deceive the Plaintiffs by only showing
them the signature page of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest and not the other pages, and that he had done so on each
of the different occasions that he presented the document to each
of the Plaintiffs for their signature, why would the corners of
the pages be damaged?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The
only explanation for that is after each signing by one of the Plaintiffs,
Dawood would take the document back and staple it with the rest of
the pages, despite knowing that he would have to remove the pages
again for the next person to sign. If Dawood had intended from the
outset to deceive the Plaintiffs by only presenting them with the
signature pages, he would simply have kept the signature pages of
the respective documents separately until all the Plaintiffs had
signed. There was no reason for him to remove the staple, let one
of the Plaintiffs sign, re-staple, and repeat the process until
everyone had signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I
am not saying that Dawood could not have done that. Of course he could.
But it was far more inconvenient and unnecessary and hence more implausible
than Mr Singh’s explanation, which was both logical as well as credible.
Indeed, it did not go unnoticed that Mr Sahagar’s response to Mr Singh’s
explanation was “I accept that’s a very fair explanation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(7)   Noorjahan’s subsequent
attendance at the Solicitors’ office in October 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Last
but not least, I noted Mr Zhulkarnain’s observation that Noorjahan
had attended at the Solicitors’ office in October 2004 to sign another
document, the Consent to the Dispensation of Sureties of the Administrative
Bond. This document was of markedly less significance than the Deed
of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Mr Zhulkarnain referred
to this fact to make the point that if the Solicitors had thought
it necessary for Noorjahan to sign this document, which was of relatively
less importance, in their presence, based on the same practice of
theirs, they would not have allowed the Deed of Renunciation of
Beneficial Interest, a substantially more important document, to
have been signed outside of their presence despite the Plaintiffs’
declaration to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Moreover,
it was not disputed that Noorjahan had attended at the Solicitors’
office in October 2004 to sign this document. Noorjahan admitted
this freely during her cross-examination. She even explained why she
was certain she had gone to their office in October 2004. Noorjahan took
pains to explain this point because she had previously stated that
she had signed some documents in the Solicitors’ office on February
2004 but this version was clearly inconsistent with Mother and Aysha’s
(though it was consistent with Dawood and the Solicitors’ version).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    If
the Plaintiffs were right, and the practice was that legal documents would
be left by Dawood at home with Mother for the siblings to sign as and
when they came to visit Mother, Noorjahan would not have paid a special
visit to the Solicitors’ office to sign the Consent to the Dispensation of
Sureties of the Administrative Bond. Ironically, Noorjahan’s insistence on
correcting her erroneous recollection, that she had visited the
Solicitors’ office in October 2004 (and not February 2004), fortified
my view that the Plaintiffs’ case that most of the documents were
not signed in front of Mr Singh was untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    To
conclude on the manner of execution of the Deed of Renunciation of
Beneficial Interest, I was satisfied first, that the deed was executed
in a meeting at the Solicitors’ office on 27 February 2004 that
was attended by all the Plaintiffs and Dawood, and secondly, that
the Plaintiff Siblings had only signed the deed after the nature
and implications of the deed had been explained to them by Mr Singh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    For
all of the foregoing reasons at [70] to [151] above, I could not safely
conclude that there was a Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement on a balance
of probabilities. Without the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement, the Plaintiffs’
case had nothing further to stand on. This reason was sufficient,
on its own, to justify dismissing the Plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dawood’s 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Notwithstanding
my decision on the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement, as mentioned right
at the very outset, I did not accept Dawood’s version of events
in 2004, either. Mr Zhulkarnain acknowledged, in his submissions, that
it was open to me to reject both the Plaintiffs’ and Dawood’s characterisation
of the events. Mr Zhulkarnain referred to <em>Loo
Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</em> [2010] 1
SLR 286 in which the Court of Appeal said (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The insufficiency of the evidence adduced
to prove the fact asserted could also be a result of the adduction
of evidence by the opposing party which undermines that assertion.
For instance, a party may be seeking to prove the existence of a
particular fact and has adduced evidence in support of it. The opposing
party, however, may be able to adduce some evidence as to the <em>non-existence</em> of that fact. Such evidence
may not be sufficient on its own for the court to conclude that,
on a balance of probabilities, the fact does not exist so as to
be “disproved”. Such evidence may, nevertheless, sufficiently undermine the
case of the party asserting the fact so as to cause doubt as to
its existence with the result that the party is unable to discharge
his burden of proving the fact. As a result, the fact concerned
is “<em>not proved</em>”. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Whilst
the effect of the evidence given by Dawood, namely his testimony,
when placed alongside the questionable evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs
on the whole gave me sufficient cause to conclude that the existence
of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was “not proved”, that same evidence
by Dawood was not so cogent that I could agree that there was an agreement
that existed, and that this agreement was Dawood’s 2004 Agreement.
The rule that he who asserts must prove also applied equally to Dawood
as it did to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The
main issue I had with Dawood’s 2004 Agreement was his reference
to Father’s wishes as the genesis and motivation for Dawood’s 2004
Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    This
was first mentioned in Dawood’s AEIC, where he stated that Father
prior to his death had informed Dawood that “the Property was to be
transferred to [Mother] and [Dawood] so that [Dawood] could look after
[Mother].” Dawood was 29 years old then, unmarried, and had just been
admitted as a cadet with SIA. According to Dawood, the second time Father
mentioned this wish was in January 2004, at the meeting of the family
members which resulted in Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. Dawood claimed
that the Plaintiffs agreed to transfer the Property to Mother and Dawood’s
joint names “in line with the wishes of [Father]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Mr
Zhulkarnain downplayed this in his submissions, to the point of almost
making no mention of it. This was understandable. Nevertheless,
as far as I was concerned, Father’s wish was an integral element
of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. On that count, I was doubtful that Father
ever had such a wish and if so, that it meant what Dawood said it
did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    First,
apart from Dawood, none of the other Plaintiffs, including Mother,
was aware of this wish of Father. This may not be surprising, given that
the Plaintiffs and Dawood’s interests are directly opposed. However,
at the very least, it was evident that Dawood’s oral testimony –
which was unsupported by any other piece of objective evidence –
was self-serving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Secondly,
it was strange for Father to specifically instruct one of his four
children to transfer the Property to the child and Mother’s joint
names upon his death, just “so that” the child can look after Mother
(see [156] above). Again, this seemed almost too convenient to be
true. I would imagine that a child taking care of his parent is
the norm; no further incentive or reward was needed to encourage
the norm. And why Father would say that to Dawood, to the exclusion
of Jahir, for example, required some explanation. There was none.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Third,
there was hardly any cross-examination of the Plaintiffs on the existence
of Father’s wish. If this was the source of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement
which Dawood said was communicated to the Plaintiffs before they
agreed to the terms of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement, I would have expected
Mr Zhulkarnain to have put this fact squarely to the Plaintiffs. This
did not take place. It was as if Mr Zhulkarnain had deliberately avoided
this elephant in the room.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Dawood
tried to allude to the fact that Jahir inherited the mutton stall business.
However, that would be comparing apples to oranges. Quite apart from
the absence of any figures relating to the profitability or value
of the mutton stall business, Jahir had to work to manage or operate
the business while the Property was a value-accretive asset. Leaving
aside taxes and other outgoings which were factors for both the
mutton stall business and the Property, it would seem that inheriting
the Property was, all things being equal, more valuable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Dawood had breached
the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    In
the light of my decision that there was no Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,
Dawood could not have breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the limitation period
was postponed pursuant to s 29 of the Limitation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I
return to the question of postponement of the limitation period
that I had reserved comment on earlier (see [60] to [66] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    On
the basis of my assessment of the facts above, it should be evident that
Mr Sahagar’s argument in relation to s 29(1) of the Limitation Act
– whether s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) or s 29(1)(<em>b</em>) – must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    As
I have already explained above, the evidence did not support a finding
that Dawood had procured the transfer surreptitiously. There was no
“secret” act by Dawood. Although the transfer of the Property was executed
by Dawood alone and without him informing the Plaintiffs, the basis
of the transfer was in fact the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest
executed by the Plaintiff Siblings, none of whom disputed that they had
signed this deed (see also [88] to [152] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Nor
did the evidence show that Dawood had fraudulently concealed the
alleged breach. There was no evidence or indeed even any allegation
by the Plaintiffs that there was concealment between 2005 and 2011,
much less a fraudulent concealment. The fact that the Plaintiffs
did not know of the true ownership until 2011 is not in itself proof
of concealment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    In
these circumstances, I could not see how it could be said that Dawood
had somehow fraudulently concealed the events leading to the transfer
of the Property to Mother and him as joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Accordingly,
in addition to my decision that the Plaintiffs’ claim ought to be
dismissed, their claim was in any event time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the lodgement of the
Caveat was wrongful, vexatious or without reasonable cause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Section
128 of the Land Titles Act permits compensation to any party who
sustains pecuniary loss that is attributable to a person who had
lodged a caveat wrongfully, vexatiously or without reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    In <em>Ho </em><em>Soo Fong and another
v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 181, the Court
of Appeal held (at [35]) that “without reasonable cause” is present
where the caveator has no honest belief based on reasonable grounds
that he has a caveatable interest. A “caveatable interest” simply
means an interest in land which, because it is recognised by the
law as such, can be availed protection by way of a caveat. Hence,
only persons who have an interest in land (as defined by s 4(1)
of the Land Titles Act) may lodge a caveat over that land: see <em>Aamna </em><em>Taseer v Shaan </em><em>Taseer and others</em> [2012] 2 SLR 348 at
[3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    On
the basis of my decision that there was no Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,
the Plaintiff Siblings could not claim to have any interest in the Property
arising from Dawood’s breach of the Plaintiff’s 2004 Agreement. They
could not even have held an honest belief that they had a caveatable interest
from the very beginning because, on the Plaintiffs’ own case, the terms
of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was for the Property to be registered
in Mother’s sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    In
other words, the performance of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement would
have resulted in Mother being the only person with a caveatable interest
in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    This
is consistent with the relief in the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim for
a declaration that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner
of the Property. This foreclosed any possibility that the Plaintiff
Siblings believed that they had a caveatable interest in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Accordingly,
I held that the Plaintiff Siblings were liable for Dawood’s loss
of $807.98 which was caused by their lodgement of the Caveat without reasonable
cause. The loss was the sum of Dawood’s cost of obtaining legal advice
and the amount that Dawood paid to obtain a copy of the Caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other observations – <em>non est factum</em> and mistake</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The doctrine of non est factum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In
his Opening Statement at the beginning of trial, Mr Zhulkarnain characterised
the Plaintiffs as seeking to invoke the doctrine of <em>non
est factum</em> to disavow the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest. This was peculiar because up to that point, as far as
I could tell, <em>non est factum</em> was not
an argument that had been mentioned by Mr Sahagar. This was later picked
up by Mr Sahagar and was argued at some length in both sides’ closing
submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In
simple terms, <em>non est factum</em> operates
as an exception to the general rule that a person is bound to the
terms of a document which he has signed, whether or not he fully
understood those terms. To successfully invoke the exception, the
person signing the document ordinarily needs to show that he “had
made a fundamental mistake as to the character or effect of the
document” and that the mistake was not due to negligence or carelessness
on his part: <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol
1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at paras
5-105 to 5-107.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    It
was in these circumstances that the issue of <em>non
est factum</em> came to be addressed in both sides’ closing
submissions. Both Mr Zhulkarnain and Mr Sahagar were in agreement
with this description of the <em>non est factum</em> doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Mr
Zhulkarnain’s point was that the Plaintiffs could not avail themselves
of the doctrine because there was no fundamental mistake as to the
character or effect of the documents, and further, the Plaintiffs
were at least careless in the execution of the Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest. Mr Sahagar submitted first, that the doctrine
was made out on the facts, but alternatively, “in any rate”, the
doctrine had no application because (a) ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence
Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) applied; and (b) “no third party rights
or interests were involved”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    I
shall briefly address Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission first.
To be candid, I did not comprehend the logic of Mr Sahagar’s approach.
The doctrine of <em>non est factum</em> was
beneficial for his clients, in the sense that it gave the Plaintiff
Siblings a legal basis to evade the consequences of their signing
of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Thus, an argument
that the doctrine of <em>non est factum</em> did
not apply runs counter to the Plaintiffs’ interest. Nevertheless,
in fairness to the Plaintiffs, I approached it on the footing that
the doctrine could apply (since Mr Zhulkarnain accepted this).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    On
the principal question, then, of whether the twin elements necessary
for a finding of <em>non est factum</em> were
made out on the facts, I did not think that the Plaintiffs could
succeed in the light of my findings above on the manner in which
the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest was executed (see
[88]–[151] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    On
the basis of my finding that Mr Singh had read out to and explained
to the Plaintiffs the contents and effect of signing the Deed of Renunciation
of Beneficial Interest, it was difficult to see how the Plaintiffs could
prove that they had fundamentally misunderstood the nature and effect
of the document. In my view, they did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Much
of Mr Sahagar’s submissions on <em>non est factum</em> were
ineffectual because they flowed from his primary case which I rejected,
that is, the relevant documents were not executed in the Solicitors’
office but at home, and that the Plaintiffs had only been shown
the signature pages and not the other pages that set out the nature
and description of the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Moreover,
if the person signing the document has had the document explained
to him by someone with the proper qualifications and skills (as happened
in this case), barring exceptional circumstances (and there are none
in the present case), it is highly implausible that the signatory
can subsequently claim that he was mistaken in thinking that the
document was fundamentally different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    It
was therefore not even necessary to determine whether the mistake was
a result of the Plaintiff Siblings’ negligence or carelessness.
But if it came down to that, I would likewise have held that any
mistake was attributable to the Plaintiff Siblings’ negligence or
carelessness in the execution of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    The
result, in my view, was not at all harsh. The doctrine of <em>non est factum</em> is not meant to give contracting
parties an easy way out of a bargain, especially one that was entered
into irresponsibly. Lord Wilberforce, in <em>Saunders
v Anglia Building Society</em> [1971] AC 1004 (“<em>Saunders</em>”), the leading case on <em>non est factum</em> (at 1027) said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In my opinion, the
correct rule … is that … a person who signs a document, and parts
with it so that it may come into other hands</em>,<b><em>has a responsibility, that of the normal man of
prudence, to take care what he signs</em></b><em>,
which, if neglected, prevents him from denying his liability under
the document according to its tenor</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The preceding paragraphs contemplate persons
who are adult and literate: the conclusion as to such persons is
that, while there are cases in which they may successfully plead
non est factum these cases will, in modern times, be rare.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to persons who are illiterate, or blind,
or lacking in understanding, the law is in a dilemma. On the one
hand, the law is traditionally, and rightly, ready to relieve them
against hardship and imposition. On the other hand, regard has to
be paid to the position of innocent third parties who cannot be expected,
and often would have no means, to know the condition or status of the
signer. I do not think that a defined solution can be provided for
all cases. <em>The law ought, in my opinion, to
give relief if satisfied that consent was truly lacking but will </em><b><em>require of signers even in this class that they
act responsibly and carefully according to their circumstances </em></b><em>in putting their signature to legal documents</em>.
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    It
bears repeating the origins of the doctrine of <em>non
est factum</em>. It was made in favour of those who are permanently
or temporarily unable, through no fault of their own, to have without
explanation any real understanding of the purport of a particular
document. This was a narrow class of persons who are typically unable
to read owing to blindness or illiteracy and who therefore had to
trust someone to tell them what they were signing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Looking
at the Plaintiffs and the circumstances surrounding the signing
of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest, I did not think that
the Plaintiffs could avail themselves of the doctrine of <em>non est factum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    There
was a further problem with any reliance by the Plaintiffs on the doctrine:
even if it were successfully invoked, it was unclear how it would support
their substantive relief that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner
of the Property. All they would be able to do is to claim that the
Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest is void; that on its
own does not entitle them to their relief. There is no need for
me to express any further observations on this issue since it is
now moot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Before
I leave this discussion, I should clarify that I thought Mr Sahagar’s
reliance on ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act to be misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The
first and most important point to note about ss 93 and 94 is that they
deal with <em>admissibility</em> of evidence.
Section 93 thus provides how the terms of a document may be proved,
and when evidence extrinsic to the document may be admitted for
that purpose:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">93.    When
the terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of
property have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the
form of a document, and in all cases in which any matter is required
by law to be reduced to the form of a document, <em>no
evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract,
grant or other disposition of property or of such matter except
the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases
in which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions of
this Act</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    If
the terms of the instrument have been proved according to s 93,
s 94 states that no evidence of any oral agreement or statement
shall be admitted as between the parties to the instrument for the
purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from
its terms. This general limitation is, however, qualified by six
provisos in s 94. It is proviso (a) that Mr Sahagar referenced in
support of his argument that the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial
Interest may be set aside without recourse to the doctrine of <em>non est factum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Proviso
(a) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>any fact may be proved</em> which
would invalidate any document or which would entitle any person
to any decree or order relating thereto; such as fraud, intimidation,
illegality, want of due execution, want of capacity in any contracting
party, the fact that it is wrongly dated, want or failure of consideration,
or mistake in fact or law … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    From
the opening words of the proviso, it was clear what the function of
the proviso was. It provided an exception to the general limitation against
admissibility of evidence of any oral agreement or statement. In other
words, any fact that supports an argument that the instrument ought to
be invalidated may be admitted, notwithstanding the general limitation. Thus,
facts relating to fraud, intimidation, illegality, want of due execution, capacity,
the date of the instrument, failure of consideration, and mistake
in fact or law, all of which are explicitly mentioned in proviso
(a), are admissible as evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    As
provisions which merely govern the admissibility of evidence, ss
93 and 94(a) do not contain or manifest any principle of law that
allows for the invalidation of an instrument. They therefore do
not provide any substantive legal basis for the setting aside of
the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. It was for this
reason that I considered Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission, that
the doctrine of <em>non est factum</em> did
not apply, rather curious (see [179] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mistake</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    On
the basis of the foregoing, there is very little left to be said
about the possibility of invoking the doctrine of unilateral mistake
to void the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Simply
put, I did not think that as a matter of fact, the Plaintiffs were
mistaken as to the nature and effect of their signature on the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    For
the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety
and allowed Dawood’s counterclaim for damages of $807.98 from the
Plaintiff Siblings in respect of their lodgement of the Caveat without reasonable
cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    In
terms of costs, I limited the Plaintiffs’ liability to 70% of Dawood’s costs.
This was to reflect my rejection of a major plank of Dawood’s case theory,
namely, the existence of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. I ordered that the
Plaintiffs pay Dawood’s costs, to be taxed if not agreed within
14 days of my oral judgment.</p>
