        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This defamation action arose out of events that
                    took place in the Singapore Swimming Club (“the Club”) between
                    November 2007 and the end of November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Club is run by a management committee
                    consisting of members who have been elected to various posts by the members at
                    the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Each management committee
                    holds office for a period of one year from one AGM to the next. The plaintiffs
                    were members of the management committee that was in office during the period
                    from May 2007 to May 2008 (“the previous MC”). During the term of
                    the previous MC, the first plaintiff held the position of President of the Club,
                    the second plaintiff was the Vice-President and the third and fourth plaintiffs
                    were, respectively, the Treasurer and Facilities Chairman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the elections held during the AGM held in May
                    2008 (“the 2008 AGM”), the defendant was elected as President and
                    a slew of new persons were elected as members of the 2008/2009 management
                    committee (“the current MC”). Only one member of the previous MC
                    was re-elected. The defendant was re-elected as President for a further year in
                    May 2009 and he held this position during the course of the proceedings before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs’ case is that libellous
                    statements concerning them were published in the minutes of the meetings of the
                    current MC held on 29 October 2008 and 26 November 2008. These minutes
                    were posted on the Club’s notice board. The defamatory allegations
                    complained of are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>First set of defamatory allegations published on 29
                            October 2008 (“the First Statement”)</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">President suggested that MC should correct the misrepresentation of facts
                        made by the previous MC to influence the ratification of the expenditure at
                        the last AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Second set of defamatory allegations published on
                            26 November 2008 (“the Second
                        Statement”)</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    From the foregoing,
                            President summarized the Treasurer’s findings as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">•</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">That the Club did not need a new water
                                system to rectify the breakdown of the then existing filtration
                                system which led to the shutdown of the competition
                            pool.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">•</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">After the installation of the new water
                                system it was found that the filtration pumps needed to be replaced
                                as the backwash water was still dirty. When the filtration pumps
                                were changed, they worked perfectly and the water was
                            clear.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">•</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The Club had purchased the new water
                                system without budget approval.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">•</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Therefore it appeared that the justifiable
                                emergency spending was to replace the filtration pumps at $42K and
                                that would rectify the pool water in the 2 pools and Jacuzzis. The
                                new water system at $168K was a ‘nice to have’ feature
                                and the capital expenditure spent to install the system without
                                budget approval was unwarranted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">•</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">It could be a case of misrepresentation of
                                facts to the AGM to get ratification for a capital expenditure for a
                                water system that could not be justified under the urgent/emergency
                                reason. The new water system was only an add-on system as the
                                current filtration was still the same as before and there was still
                                a need to replace the pumps.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant denies that the words complained
                    of bear the defamatory meanings ascribed to them by the plaintiffs. In the
                    alternative, he seeks to justify those allegations and, in the further
                    alternative, to rely on qualified privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Club, which is over 100 years old, prides
                    itself on being a premier swimming club. One of the top priorities of each
                    management committee is to ensure that the swimming facilities are in good
                    condition. The Club has two large Olympic-size swimming pools, one a
                    recreational pool and the other used mainly for serious training and
                    competitions. The Club is also equipped with two Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The general administration of the Club is under
                    the charge of a general manager who reports to the management committee. In
                    November 2007, the general manager was one Mr Richard Phua.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 10 November 2007, the Club’s
                    competition pool was closed by the general manager as there were complaints that
                    the water in the pool had turned yellowish and that children using the pool had
                    developed rashes. A special meeting of the previous MC was being held that day
                    to consider matters relating to the upgrading of the area surrounding the
                    competition pool and the general manager decided to table the issue of the pool
                    water and the filtration system for discussion at the same
                meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The meeting started with a presentation by a
                    company called The Water Consultant Pte Ltd (“TWC”) on a water
                    system called the Natural Water System (“NWS”). The representation
                    was given by one Mr Jeremy Rawle (“Mr Rawle”) and his
                    wife, Ms Sylvia Chan. The meeting was informed that the NWS was an
                    innovative and advanced technology which maintained water in its natural and
                    neutral form without chemicals. TWC represented that the NWS could solve the
                    filtration problem at the competition pool. After the presentation, Mr Phua
                    informed the meeting that the only operational sand filtration tank serving the
                    competition pool had become choked that morning and this had caused the water to
                    change colour. The filtration tanks at the recreational pool were partially
                    choked and would break down in a matter of months. As for the pumps, they were
                    in need of an overhaul.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To solve the filtration problem, Mr Phua
                    told the meeting that the Club could either choose to carry out conventional
                    repairs, <em>ie</em> sandblast the filtration tanks, or
                    install the NWS. The cost of sandblasting was approximately $480,000 (this
                    estimate was later reduced to $280,000) whilst TWC had offered the Club a
                    special package price of $168,800 for its system. This price would include the
                    NWS at both pools and the installation of another system, the mineral water
                    system (“MWS”), at the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After considering the information presented,
                    the previous MC was in favour of installing the NWS on the grounds of cost, the
                    time that would be taken to get the competition pool back in use and the
                    healthier swimming environment that the NWS would provide. The previous MC gave
                    its in-principle approval to Mr Phua to install the NWS at a cost of
                    $168,000. In the event, the contract when signed in December 2007 provided for a
                    sum of $168,800. This figure which I will hereinafter sometimes refer to as
                    “the expenditure” was, according to the contract, made up of the
                    following components:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The previous MC directed the general manager
                    to ensure that due diligence was carried out before the contract was signed and
                    to negotiate the best possible terms. No budget had been provided for the
                    purchase of the NWS but the Club’s financial rules allowed a management
                    committee, in case of an emergency, to authorise the expenditure required to
                    resolve the emergency and to subsequently seek approval for the same from the
                    members at the next AGM. The previous MC considered that the issue confronting
                    it was of an emergency nature and therefore gave its in-principle approval for
                    the expenditure on the NWS on the basis that the same had to be ratified later
                    by the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The next meeting of the previous MC was held
                    on 27 November 2007. The members of the previous MC were informed of the
                    series of events that had, from April 2007, led to the breakdown of the
                    filtration system of the competition pool. The general manager also briefed the
                    previous MC on his actions in relation to due diligence in respect of the TWC
                    proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 6 December 2007, the previous MC held
                    another special meeting. Mr Phua briefed the meeting on follow-up action
                    that he had taken in accordance with instructions given at the meeting of
                    27 November 2007. The previous MC then gave its approval to Mr Phua to
                    proceed to execute the contract with TWC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Installation of the NWS took place thereafter.
                    The competition pool was reopened on 11 January 2008. On 22 January
                    2008, Mr Phua informed the previous MC that the installation of the system
                    at the competition pool and the spas had been completed but that installation of
                    the system at the recreation pool would be delayed as new pumps were required
                    and would be installed in March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The 2008 AGM took place on 25 May. As the
                    expenditure incurred on the systems supplied by TWC and the new pumps had not
                    been provided for in the budget for the 2007-2008 budget year, these items were
                    put up for members’ approval at the AGM as emergency expenditure.
                    Apparently, the 2008 AGM was attended by more than 2,000 members though, since
                    it spanned several hours, not all of them may have been present throughout the
                    meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The first plaintiff in his capacity as
                    President explained to the meeting why there was a need to ratify the
                    expenditure. The general manager also addressed the meeting on these items. Many
                    questions were asked relating to whether the expenditure was justifiable and one
                    of the members proposed that an audit committee (“the Audit
                    Committee”) be appointed to conduct an independent review of the whole
                    project before the expenditure was ratified. The motion proposed was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That Items 9(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the AGM Agenda be not ratified but be
                        referred to the Special Ad Hoc Audit Committee for review of the whole
                        process and project and be reported back to the Management Committee and
                        Members within 3 months from date of the AGM</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The motion was carried with 210 members of the Club supporting it. It
                    should be noted that of the four items mentioned, the latter two were unrelated
                    to the matters involved in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Elections for the management committee took
                    place at the 2008 AGM and the plaintiffs, although they contested the election,
                    were not re-elected. The defendant was elected as President of the current MC.
                    Subsequently, the current MC appointed four members of the Club to serve on the
                    Audit Committee established by the general meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Audit Committee duly carried out its
                    investigations. It issued its report, the Audit Report, on 8 August 2008.
                    In relation to the NWS, it concluded that the prescribed procedures had been
                    followed and that the selection process in respect of the supplier was in order.
                    It also found that the works done fell within the definition of
                    “emergency”. As for the purchase of the pumps, the Audit Committee
                    came to a similar conclusion. The Audit Report was given to the current MC but
                    it was not released to the members generally at the time of its
                issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Some time in the last week of August 2008,
                    Mr Phua left the employ of the Club. Subsequently, a yellow file entitled
                    “Water Consultants” was found in his office and handed to
                    Mr Tan Wee Tin who held the post of Treasurer on the current MC. The
                    material in the file caused Mr Tan and the defendant some concern regarding
                    the representations that had been made to the 2008 AGM on the NWS. The defendant
                    requested Mr Tan to look into the matter and report his findings to the
                    current MC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In September 2008, there were some discussions
                    and correspondence between the current MC and the Audit Committee regarding
                    whether the Audit Committee would wish to review the Audit Report in the light
                    of the additional information and documents that had been found in the yellow
                    file. At that stage, the Audit Committee did not seem inclined to do so. In the
                    meantime, Mr Tan continued his investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 29 October 2008, at the monthly
                    meeting of the current MC, Mr Tan reported his findings up to that stage on
                    the issue of the purchase of the NWS. He provided the current MC members with a
                    document setting out a summary of his findings. It was during the discussion on
                    Mr Tan’s report, that the defendant made the remarks that were later
                    reported in the minutes of the meeting as the First Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The next monthly meeting of the current MC was
                    held on 26 November 2008. In the meantime, Mr Tan had carried out
                    further investigations. After Mr Tan completed a fairly lengthy report on
                    his further findings, the defendant summarised his findings so that everyone
                    understood what had been said. The discussions were subsequently paraphrased in
                    the minutes of the meeting and the Second Statement appeared as part of what the
                    defendant had said in the course of his summary. It should be noted that the
                    minutes of both the October and the November 2008 management committee meetings
                    were, when issued, posted on the Club’s notice board for all members to
                    read, in accordance with the Club’s usual practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At the November 2008 meeting, the defendant
                    suggested that Mr Tan’s findings should be set out in an addendum to
                    the Audit Report which should be released to the members of the Club so that
                    they could make an informed decision as to whether to ratify the previous
                    MC’s expenditure of $168,800. This suggestion was accepted by the current
                    MC. Subsequently in early May 2009, copies of the Audit Report together with the
                    Addendum prepared by the current MC were made available to all members of the
                    Club as part of the Notice of the 2009 AGM. At the AGM itself, the first
                    plaintiff read out a written Response on the Report of the Audit Committee and
                    the Addendum which was signed by a few members of the previous MC including the
                    first, second and fourth plaintiffs. In the event, the expenditure was not
                    ratified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The above is a very brief summary of some of
                    the events that are relevant to this action. I will go into more detail as and
                    when it may be necessary in my discussion of the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This action was started on 12 January
                    2009 shortly after the publication of the minutes of the management committee
                    meetings of 29 October and 26 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     From the pleadings, the issues that arise for
                    determination are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the First Statement and the
                        Second Statement bear the meanings pleaded by the plaintiffs at,
                        respectively, paragraphs 7 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and if so,
                        whether these meanings are defamatory of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the First and Second Statements are
                        found to bear the plaintiffs’ meanings or if they are found to bear
                        some lesser meanings that are still defamatory of the plaintiffs, whether
                        the defendant has justified the sting of the libel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the defendant is unable to justify
                        the meanings of the First and Second Statements, has he shown that they were
                        made on an occasion of qualified privilege?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     Was the defendant actuated by malice in
                        publishing the First and Second Statements so as to deprive him of the
                        defence of qualified privilege?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Meaning of the First and Second Statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In respect of both the Statements, the
                    plaintiffs’ contention is that they are defamatory according to the
                    natural and ordinary meanings of the words used. The legal principles applicable
                    in determining meaning when the “natural and ordinary” meaning of
                    a word or phrase is relied on have been laid down in several legal authorities.
                    What follows is a paraphrase of these. The court is not confined to the literal
                    or strict meaning of the words but has to decide what meaning they would have
                    conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and
                    commonsense. The test is an objective one and the meaning intended by the maker
                    of the defamatory statement is irrelevant. The court takes into account what the
                    ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words and bears in
                    mind that such person would read between the lines. It is also important to have
                    regard to the manner in which the words had been said and the surrounding
                    circumstances. Where the words appear in a publication, the publication must be
                    considered as a whole, including the circumstances in which the words are used,
                    the prominence given to any headings and the nature of the publication. It is
                    necessary to examine the context in which the words were used and if the words
                    are capable of several meanings, the court should not select one bad meaning
                    where other non-defamatory meanings are available. See <em>Lim
                        Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004 at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiffs submitted, and I agree, that in
                    the circumstances of this case where the statements were contained in the
                    minutes of the Club’s management committee meetings and these minutes were
                    published principally to Club members, the “ordinary reasonable
                    person” would be one who was a member of the Club at the material time
                    and who was interested in the affairs of the Club. I would therefore have to
                    bear in mind what the ordinary reasonable and interested Club member’s
                    general knowledge of the affairs of the Club would have been when the minutes
                    were published. I will take the Statements in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In paras 6 and 7 of the statement of
                    claim, the plaintiffs pleaded that the First Statement referred to the
                    plaintiffs by way of their office as members of the previous MC and, in its
                    natural and ordinary meaning, meant and/or was understood to mean:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the plaintiffs had
                        intentionally misrepresented to Club members that it was necessary to
                        replace the water filtration system on the basis that it was urgent and/or
                        an emergency in order to justify the expenditure and obtain the Club
                        members’ ratification of the said expenditure at the 2008 AGM;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the
                        plaintiffs had not acted in the interests of the Club and had misused or
                        abused the funds of the Club by the installation of a water filtration
                        system which was unnecessary; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the plaintiffs had acted improperly when they failed
                        to comply with the proper procedures to obtain budget approval for the same,
                        under the guise that it was necessary and/or an
                emergency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant accepted that the First
                    Statement means that in the course of seeking ratification for the expenditure
                    of $168,800, inaccurate representations were made by the previous MC to the
                    members of the Club. He did not accept that the First Statement also means that
                    those misrepresentations were made intentionally by the previous MC. Instead, he
                    said, the First Statement means:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiffs had not acted in the
                        interests of the Club and had misused or abused the funds of the Club by the
                        installation of a water filtration system which was unnecessary;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        plaintiffs had acted improperly when they failed to comply with the proper
                        procedures to obtain budget approval for the same under the guise that it
                        was necessary and/or an emergency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant argued that just because the
                    First Statement can reasonably be read to mean that the purpose of making the
                    representations was to influence the ratification, it did not imply that the
                    plaintiffs had deliberately made false representations. In the defendant’s
                    view, the word “misrepresent” does not necessarily imply any
                    deliberateness since a misrepresentation may be fraudulent, negligent or
                    innocent. Further, someone may say something to influence a result but may have
                    been mistaken. The assertion that representation was made for a specific purpose
                    therefore does nothing to illuminate the mind of its maker. Agreeing that
                    context was all important, the defendant made an analysis of the 29 October 2008
                    meeting minutes and submitted that the reasonable reader would not have
                    understood the defendant to be suggesting that the previous MC had deliberately
                    misled the members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Whilst the minutes themselves must be looked
                    at, the analysis of the impression that the First Statement would have made
                    cannot be confined to the context of the minutes. The context that must be
                    regarded is the background to the discussion that took place during the meeting
                    and the ordinary reasonable member’s knowledge of that
                background.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The ordinary member would have known what had
                    occurred during the 2008 AGM. It is not in dispute that the 2008 AGM had
                    attracted a large turnout. During the meeting, the NWS was discussed on more
                    than one occasion and both the first plaintiff and the general manager had
                    addressed the meeting on the expenditure of $168,800 and the reasons for it.
                    There had been a lively debate and the ordinary member who took an interest in
                    the AGM would have known that the previous MC sought ratification for the
                    expenditure which was unbudgeted and justified on the grounds of being an
                    emergency. Such a member would also have known that instead of ratifying the
                    expenditure, the meeting had decided to form the Audit Committee to review the
                    entire process of approval by the previous MC and to make its report within
                    three months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     When the minutes of the 27 August 2008
                    management committee meeting were posted on the notice board, members would have
                    learnt that the draft report of the Audit Committee had been circulated to all
                    the current MC members at that meeting. They would have learnt from the minutes
                    of the current MC meeting held on 24 September 2008 that the Treasurer had
                    informed the Chairman of the Audit Committee that the documents and information
                    furnished by the management to the Audit Committee might be incomplete and
                    certain documents discovered after the general manager’s dismissal were
                    now available to be considered. The current MC decided at that meeting to ask
                    the Audit Committee to revisit the Audit Report in the light of the additional
                    information. At the next meeting, the Treasurer had informed the current MC that
                    the documents found in the general manager’s office indicated certain
                    breaches of procedure in the acquisition of the new water filtration system. The
                    minutes of the 29 October 2008 meeting recorded that the Treasurer was
                    going to gather the Audit Committee for a meeting to revisit the audit and look
                    into the newly discovered documents and information. The minutes also contained
                    detailed information on the Treasurer’s investigations into the purchase
                    of the NWS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiffs submitted, and I agree, that
                    from all this information, an objective member would have understood that as a
                    result of the Treasurer’s investigation, the current MC had found
                    something untoward in relation to the expenditure. In this context, on a plain
                    and literal meaning of the First Statement, it would have appeared to the
                    ordinary reasonable member that what was being implied was not innocent
                    misrepresentation or a careless presentation of inaccurate facts by the previous
                    MC. Instead the First Statement, read literally, meant that there had been a
                    misrepresentation with a motive, specifically that the previous MC had made
                    misrepresentations to the Club members to influence the ratification of the
                    expenditure at the 2008 AGM. Therefore, the wording of the First Statement
                    coupled with the background facts would have conveyed to the ordinary reasonable
                    Club member the impression that the plaintiffs had lied in order to influence
                    ratification of the expenditure. This is a defamatory meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Turning to the Second Statement, in
                    para 12 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs pleaded that in its
                    natural and ordinary meaning, the Second Statement bore the same defamatory
                    meaning as the First Statement. The defendant took the position that the Second
                    Statement was less serious than the First Statement for three reasons. First,
                    there was no assertion that there had been any misrepresentation, only that it
                    “could be” such a case. Second, the Second Statement did not
                    attribute the misrepresentation to the previous MC. Third, in its proper
                    context, the Second Statement appeared only as a summary of the
                    Treasurer’s statements at the 26 November 2008 meeting of the current
                    MC. Indeed, the Second Statement was a fair summary of what the Treasurer said
                    and the presentation made by the Treasurer did not contain any accusation of
                    deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the previous MC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I do not accept the defendant’s
                    position. I think it places undue emphasis on the words “could be”
                    without due regard for the whole context including the report given by the
                    Treasurer on 26 November 2008. This report, as the ordinary member would
                    have known, was a report on the Treasurer’s continuing investigations into
                    the expenditure. As noted in the minutes, the Treasurer mentioned some
                    unsatisfactory features of the way in which the contract for the NWS had been
                    signed and payment had been made. The Treasurer did not mention the word
                    “misrepresentation” although he drew the current MC’s
                    attention to the fact that the stated cost of $420,000 to sandblast the old sand
                    filters which was printed in the 2008 AGM Booklet did not tally with the quoted
                    repair cost of $280,000 mentioned in a notice to members dated 12 November
                    2007. Then, the defendant summarised the Treasurer’s findings and,
                    basically, said that the Club did not need a new water system, that it had
                    purchased a new water system without budget approval and that the capital
                    expenditure on this system was unwarranted. He was reported as having then gone
                    on to say that this “could be a misrepresentation of facts to the AGM to
                    get ratification for a capital expenditure for a water system that could not be
                    justified under the urgent/emergency system”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my judgment, the Second Statement which is
                    part of the defendant’s summary of what the Treasurer stated, in its
                    natural and ordinary meaning was not speculating as to whether or not there had
                    been a misrepresentation but was stating clearly that the previous MC had
                    intentionally misrepresented the facts in order to have unwarranted expenditure
                    ratified. In context, the phrase “could be” was mere verbiage and
                    would not have changed the meaning that the reasonable member would have taken
                    from the Second Statement. Though the Treasurer had not expressly alleged
                    misrepresentation, his report indicated at least one instance where he
                    considered that wrong information had been given to the members at the 2008 AGM.
                    This may have led to the use of the word “misrepresentation” by
                    the defendant but even if the defendant was making explicit what the Treasurer
                    had implied, on the basis of what he understood the Treasurer to have said, that
                    would not excuse the defendant from responsibility for his defamatory remarks.
                    Although the Second Statement did not mention the previous MC by name, since the
                    ordinary reasonable member would have known that it was the previous MC that
                    wanted to obtain ratification for the expenditure, the Second Statement
                    necessarily implied that it was the previous MC that had made the
                    misrepresentation to the AGM. In coming to this finding, I am not ignoring the
                    fact that the defendant did not actually voice the Second Statement at the
                    meeting. Instead, the Second Statement was a printed paraphrase of his actual
                    words. Since the defendant approved the minutes, however, he bears
                    responsibility for the Second Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I am satisfied that on their natural and
                    ordinary meanings, the First and Second Statements bear the meanings imputed to
                    them by the plaintiffs as pleaded in the statement of claim and set out in
                    [30(a)] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Justification – particulars and law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I now turn to the first defence of the
                    defendant which is that the Statements were true. In para 29 of the
                    defence, the defendant pleaded that insofar as the First Statement in its
                    natural and ordinary meaning bore and/or was understood to bear the meanings set
                    out in para 7 of the statement of claim, it was true in substance and in
                    fact. In para 38 of the defence, the defendant pleaded that insofar as the
                    Second Statement in its natural and ordinary meaning bore and/or was understood
                    to bear the meanings set out in para 12 of the statement of claim, it was
                    true in substance and fact. The defendant relied on the particulars set out in
                    paras 27 and 28 of the defence to substantiate his assertions of the truth
                    of both Statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The particulars of justification were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     The NWS and the Auto Dozers were not
                        emergency purchases because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The NWS did not rectify
                            and/or address the issue of the contamination of the competition pool
                            that took place on or about 10 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The problem with the
                            contamination of the competition pool could have been rectified and/or
                            dealt with by replacing one of the pumps serving the competition pool,
                            which had broken down on or about 10 November
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       After the installation of the NWS, the broken down pump serving the
                            competition pool still needed to be replaced before the contamination
                            problem was rectified and the pool was reopened for
                        use.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The
                            Auto Dozers which were purchased as part of the $168,800 NWS for both
                            the Club’s swimming pools and which costs $9,700 each were not
                            functional and had not been in use at all after the installation of the
                            NWS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     TWC made their presentation on the new water technology to the Club’s
                        Facilities Sub-committee as early as during the eleventh Facilities
                        Sub-committee meeting held on 12 April 2007, and not at or around the
                        same time when the Club’s competition pool was contaminated and closed
                        on 10 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     Only the Club’s competition pool and recreational
                        pool were to be, and were in fact, installed with NWS at a total cost of
                        $150,000. The Club’s Jacuzzis were to be, and were in fact, installed
                        with another system the “Carefree Water System” (<em>ie</em> the MWS) at the cost of $18,800. The MWS had
                        nothing to do with the contamination in the Club’s competition pool,
                        and was therefore not an emergency purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     Only the MWS employs the process of ionising
                        water. The NWS does not carry out ionisation of water, but instead allegedly
                        uses resonance frequencies to neutralise bonding/ formation of large mineral
                        crystals and to prevent scale formation. The installation of the NWS in
                        respect of the Club’s competition and recreational pools did not
                        result in the ionisation of the water in the pools to “<em>break down the sand in the filters saving the effort to
                            sandblast the sand filters which, over the past 20 years, had coagulated
                            to the state of stone which rendered the sand filter
                            ineffective</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     Replacement of the broken down pump serving the
                        competition pool would have been the cheaper alternative to installing the
                        NWS for the purpose of resolving the contamination problem with the
                        competition pool.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_f"></a>(f)     There was no emergency need to repair or replace four filtration
                        tanks to rectify or resolve the contamination of the competition
                        pool:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       The competition pool has
                            two filtration tanks attached to it. However, one of the tanks had been
                            decommissioned several years previously and was not performing any
                            filtration function.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The competition pool had been functioning with
                            only one filtration tank for a significant period of
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       At the time of the contamination of the competition pool, only one
                            filtration tank was serving the competition pool.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The recreational pool has
                            three filtration tanks attached to it. However, one of the tanks had
                            been decommissioned several years previously and was not performing any
                            filtration function.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_v"></a>(v)       The recreational pool had been functioning with
                            only two filtration tanks for a significant period of
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       At
                            the time of the contamination of the competition pool, the two
                            filtration tanks serving the recreational pool were still
                            operational.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_f-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       In the circumstances, the breakdown of
                            swimming pool equipment and the contamination of the competition pool
                            did not include or affect the two decommissioned filtration tanks and
                            the two operational filtration tanks that were serving the recreational
                            pool. There was correspondingly no emergency need to repair or replace
                            the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_g"></a>(g)     Installation of the NWS was not a cheaper alternative to
                        sandblasting, further and/or alternatively, the previous MC had inflated the
                        costs of sandblasting the filtration tanks:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_g-p3_i"></a>(i)       The costs for refurbishing
                            the sand filter tanks for the competition pool and the recreational pool
                            had, on 15 November 2007, been quoted by Memiontec Pte Ltd at
                            $70,000 and $65,000 respectively, and not $480,000 (<em>ie</em> $120,000 per tank x 4) as represented in Appendix D,
                            or even $280,000 (<em>ie</em> $70,000 per tank x 4)
                            as stated in the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_g-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The previous MC and the former General Manager
                            had included the long decommissioned filtration tank attached to the
                            Club’s competition pool, and the two operating filtration tanks
                            serving the recreational pool in the projected costs of sandblasting
                            when there was no reason to do so, thereby inflating the costs of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_h"></a>(h)     The NWS is not a “<em>brand new

                        add-on system designed to de-scale water which may help improve the
                        efficiency of the existing filters.</p>

                        added to the Club’s swimming pools even after the installation of the
                        NWS. Further, about the same quantity of chlorine is used in the

                        contain “<em>mineral

                        sand filtration medium at the costs of between $15,000 and $25,000 for each
                        tank, which was a cheaper alternative to installing the

                        of 10 November 2007 (<em>ie</em> on the very day
                        that the competition pool was closed), and there was no “<em>lengthy study</em>” or “<em>much deliberation</em>’ prior to the purchase of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_p"></a>(p)     It was the duty of the member of the previous

                        purchase of the NWS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_q"></a>(q)     The plaintiffs failed to ensure that all material facts and matters

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I have set out the particulars of
                    justification in detail to provide a guide to the discussion that follows. I
                    accept, however, that in justifying his defamatory statements, the defendant
                    does not have to prove the truth of every word, merely that the gist of the
                    defamatory sting is true. See <em>Aaron Anne Joseph v Cheong Yip
                        Seng</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 258; <em>Gatley on
                        Libel and Slander</em> (11<sup>th</sup> Ed, Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell) at pp 320–321. Further, in justifying his defamatory
                    statement, a defendant may rely upon facts subsisting at the time of publication
                    even if he was unaware of them at that time. See <em>Musa King v
                        Telegraph Group Limited</em> [2004] EWLR 23.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Justification – the alleged misrepresentations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Before I deal with the representations made, I
                    should say a few words about the duties that the plaintiffs as members of the
                    previous MC owed the general membership of the Club. The plaintiffs accepted
                    that they were accountable to members for what they did while serving on the
                    previous MC. The first and second plaintiffs agreed that any management
                    committee had to act in the best interests of the Club. As far as the spending
                    of Club funds was concerned, if the proposed expenditure had not been provided
                    for in the budget, three of the plaintiffs agreed that then the management
                    committee would have to be satisfied that there was an emergency to be addressed
                    and that this expenditure was necessary to address that emergency. Thereafter,
                    the management committee would have to seek ratification of the emergency
                    expenditure from the general body. In this context the plaintiffs accepted that
                    the management committee concerned would be under a duty to give full and frank
                    disclosure of all the relevant facts to the members. In order to make a
                    considered decision as to whether to ratify the spending, the members would have
                    to be informed of all relevant facts, whether such facts would support
                    ratification or not. The plaintiffs also accepted that if part of the
                    expenditure did not concern the emergency, the members would have to be notified
                    of that fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In his closing submissions, the
                    defendant’s allegation was that the plaintiffs had made or condoned
                    representations falling into various categories which were actually
                    misrepresentations to procure the ratification of the expenditure. I will
                    consider these categories in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">An “emergency spend”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The first category of representations was to
                    establish that the sum of $168,800 was “an emergency spend” and,
                    according to the defendant, it contained incorrect information about what was
                    purchased. The defendant’s case was that these misrepresentations appeared
                    from the following:</p>

                                Sub-Committee decided to install a brand new filtration system
                                incorporating Hydrosmart Technology. This system adds resonance
                                frequencies to the water making it soft, removes scales and prevents
                                algae. Furthermore it does away with the need for chemical
                                additives. Members now enjoy the benefits of mineral water in our

                        up before the ratification of the expenditure was put to the
                    vote.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Before I go on to discuss the statements made
                    at the 2008 AGM, the effect of the various statements quoted from the Annual
                    Report and the Booklet was as follows. First, the members were being given the
                    impression from most of what was said that only one system had been purchased
                    and this system was designed to resolve the problems with the pools and the
                    Jacuzzis. Secondly, with regard to Appendix D, the first and second plaintiffs
                    agreed that it did not explain the differences between the NWS and the MWS.
                    Further, by stating that TWC had offered “to install the natural water
                    system for both pools as well as our Jacuzzis at a cost of SGD168K”, the
                    impression given was that the pools and the spas used the same system. The
                    second plaintiff also agreed that it would have been clear to all members
                    reading it that what was being said was that all the expenses set out in
                    Appendix D were emergency expenses and therefore every dollar of the expenditure
                    had been spent to address an emergency. The plaintiffs, however, accepted that
                    the members were not told that the system installed in the Jacuzzis was not
                    intended to deal with any emergency experienced by the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The documents did contain two references to
                    the MWS: on the cover page of Appendix D and in a heading of one page, the MWS
                    was mentioned. These portions state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    To ratify the expenditure of $168k for the
                            installation of the Natural Water System in our pools and a Mineral
                            Water System in the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The question is, however, whether these two references would have
                    alerted the members to the fact that there were two different systems when there
                    were so many other statements which pointed to only one system having being
                    purchased. The plaintiffs themselves had agreed that the members would have
                    understood that only one system was purchased. Looking at the various statements
                    made in the documents, it appears to me that most members would have thought
                    that one system had been bought which managed to provide varying benefits in the
                    pools and Jacuzzis. Members who read the material carefully would not, I think,
                    have understood that the two systems were separate and need not have been bought
                    together. Instead, they may have been confused as to what had actually been
                    purchased. In any case, the statements taken as a whole would have conveyed the
                    message to the members that all of the expenditure was effected to meet an
                    emergency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The impression given by the documents would,
                    in my view, have been reinforced by the first plaintiff’s summing up at
                    the 2008 AGM. This is the matter referred to in [46(c)] and this is what the
                    first plaintiff said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So we move to item 9 first, which is to ratify expenditures approved by
                        the Management Committee. First one is the installation of the Natural Water
                        System in the pools and Jacuzzis, at 168,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think there’s been quite a, a lot of discussion on this earlier,
                        but the question at hand is, why did the MC approve this expenditure ahead
                        of the AGM, whilst there was no budget for it. And to explain the issue, the
                        situation came about very suddenly when one day the pool water turned green,
                        and uh, there was influx of complaints from members about their children
                        getting rashes and uh drinking, swallowing green water and so on and so
                        forth. And upon investigation, we discovered what you already know, as the
                        pumps and filters, well not all of them, but uh, have started to break
                        down.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Uh the pools was [<em>sic</em>] then immediately
                        closed to avoid any further mishaps. And in the month or so that ensued, we
                        went through the routine that you already know about and finally decided on
                        this particular system which was in our minds above all the other points
                        that were discussed, really the cheaper alternative compared to having to
                        change the filters and the sand and we (shortblast) – sandblast them
                        and everything for a real heavy price, without, and ending up with
                        technology that is really 30 to 50 years old. <em>So it was
                            felt that the 168,000, uh, after the due diligence was carried out, was
                            the way to go, and up to today, we have had good comments from this, and
                            the water is crystal clear not only in the pools but also in the
                            Jacuzzis</em>, the big advantage being that the smell of chlorine
                        and your potentially bleached hair and red skin and all are all done away
                        with, so we ask that members ratify this, because it was done, a decision
                        had been made to avoid uh, problems, health problems, you know, which were
                        thrust upon us, you know, like a disaster (unclear). Nothing we could do
                        about it, so I (open it to the House). Thank you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The first plaintiff was asked whether he
                    agreed that it was quite clear that in the summing up he had portrayed the
                    entire $168,800 as an “emergency spend”. His answer was
                    “Yes”. He was then asked whether he accepted that it was wrong of
                    him not to tell the members that some components of the expenditure had nothing
                    to do with the emergency and his reply was “in hindsight, yes, maybe I
                    should have mentioned”. Then, there was the following exchange:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Thank you. By not telling them that components of
                            the 168,000 had nothing to do with the emergency, you were in fact
                            misleading them that the entire 168,000 was relevant to address the
                            emergency – agreed?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is also clear to me that the summing up
                    would have reinforced any impression that the members had obtained from the
                    Annual Report and Booklet that the expenditure had been used to purchase one
                    system which had the result of solving the problems in both the pools and in the
                    Jacuzzis. Any member who may have realised that, possibly, two systems had been
                    bought would, after hearing the first plaintiff, have considered this impression
                    to be mistaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     So to sum up, two important representations
                    made in the documents and at the meeting were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">One system was purchased.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">All of the expenditure was incurred to meet an
                            emergency.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The next question is whether these representations were
                true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     At the trial, it was common ground that two
                    systems rather than one were purchased. The evidence also showed that not all of
                    the expenditure was incurred to meet an emergency. There was no emergency with
                    the Jacuzzis and the money spent on the Auto-Dozers was not really necessary to
                    deal with the problem in the competition pool. There was also doubt as to
                    whether money needed to be spent on the recreational pool at the same time. No
                    convincing evidence was adduced that the recreation pool had any problem that
                    could not be solved by the purchase of new pumps. Only one emergency had cropped
                    up and that was the emergency with the competition pool. The members were not
                    told that the contract for the expenditure comprised several distinct components
                    or that the NWS could have been purchased for the competition pool alone in
                    order to resolve the emergency. All that the members were told was that the
                    previous MC had solved the emergency by the expenditure and that it was cheaper
                    to do it this way then to resort to the traditional sandblasting alternative. It
                    appears to me that the representations were not true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The plaintiffs’ position was that the
                    previous MC had dealt with the recreational pool and the Jacuzzis holistically
                    as a package. At the material time, the plaintiffs had been told that the
                    recreational pool was in as bad a state as the competition pool and that it was
                    a matter of time before its filtration system broke down. The recreational pool
                    had not been overhauled for the previous 20 years and there had been no
                    sandblasting of the tank during that period. Further, prior to the closure of
                    the competition pool, the previous MC had already intended to provide a budget
                    for sandblasting the filtration tanks of both pools in the Club’s capital
                    expenditure budget for the year 2008 – 2009. The upgrading of the
                    filtration system at both pools would therefore have been something the previous
                    MC would look into even if the competition pool was not closed on
                    10 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It was submitted that the previous MC had
                    therefore taken a holistic approach to resolving the problems faced by the
                    Club’s swimming pools. The decision to install the NWS at the recreational
                    pool was made <em>bona fide</em> as the decision of a
                    responsible management committee. To wait half a year for budget approval to
                    repair/upgrade the filtration system at the recreational pool would simply show
                    a lack of foresight. Inaction might well have been construed as irresponsible
                    conduct in the light of the prevailing circumstances. The plaintiffs as members
                    of a responsible management committee were entitled to deal with the matter on a
                    global basis to avoid repeated closures of the pools, which would have reflected
                    badly on the Club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As for the Jacuzzis, the previous MC had been
                    told by TWC during the presentation on 10 November 2007 that it had
                    inspected these facilities and found the water clarity to be poor. The TWC
                    representatives also mentioned that the Jacuzzis had a strong chlorine odour.
                    The first plaintiff himself had complained many times about the state of the
                    murky and smelly water in the Club’s Jacuzzis and Mr Phua was also
                    aware of similar complaints. TWC offered to remedy the problem at the Jacuzzis
                    as part of the special package which they had presented. The previous MC
                    considered that $168,800 was a good price to pay for a system that would not
                    only resolve the contamination in the competition pool, but also prevent future
                    problems with the recreational pool and the Jacuzzis. This was a reasonable
                    method of dealing with the concerns facing the previous MC at that
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiffs also suggested that the errors
                    in the representations were made innocently as they had left the details of the
                    purchase to Mr Phua and they themselves were unclear about what they were
                    buying.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It appears to me however from the evidence
                    that at the material time, the plaintiffs knew that it was not possible to
                    justify the entire sum of $168,800 as expenditure to solve an emergency. They
                    accepted that the problem with the competition pool was the only emergency. The
                    first and second plaintiffs also admitted that, while they were aware that
                    purchasing the MWS for the Jacuzzis was not intended to solve an emergency, they
                    decided to go ahead with it anyway. The solution, the first plaintiff thought,
                    would be to explain matters to the members and hope that they would understand.
                    In the event, the plaintiffs were not upfront in their explanation. They did not
                    clearly indicate to the members that they had purchased two different systems
                    and one of the systems was simply purchased because they had been persuaded that
                    it would be nice to have the MWS technology in the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the plaintiffs’ explanations that
                    at the material time they did not understand exactly what they were purchasing,
                    it is difficult to accept the same at face value. First, the evidence
                    establishes that during the presentation on 10 November 2007, TWC made it
                    clear that they were selling two different systems to the Club: the NWS for the
                    pools and the MWS for the Jacuzzis. Second, TWC informed the previous MC (and
                    this information was subsequently confirmed by the due diligence investigations
                    carried out by the management) that the two systems had two different
                    principals: Hydrosmart International Pty Ltd (“Hydrosmart”) from
                    Australia for the NWS and Carefree Clearwater Ltd (“Carefree”)
                    from the US for the MWS. The presentation made it clear that the two systems
                    were based on different principles and technologies, and were intended to
                    address two different problems. Third, prior to the signing of the contract, the
                    plaintiffs were shown two different warranties from the two different
                    principals. Fourth, the plaintiffs were informed that the MWS had been installed
                    in Singapore previously but the Club would be the first in Singapore to install
                    the NWS. At the end of the presentation on 10 November 2007, the plaintiffs
                    knew that they were buying two different systems and even if some of them were
                    confused about this, by the time the contract was signed in December 2007, that
                    confusion would have been cleared up because of the reports that Mr Phua
                    made to them regarding his investigations into the manufacturers of the two
                    systems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I do not accept the first plaintiff’s
                    assertion that he had not learnt of the differences between the NWS and the MWS
                    until two months after the 2008 AGM. This was the assertion that he made during
                    the first tranche of the trial. At the resumed hearing when the tapes of the
                    previous MC’s meetings held on 10 November 2007, 27 November
                    2007 and 6 December 2007 had been transcribed, the first plaintiff admitted
                    that it had been made clear to him and that he understood that there were two
                    different systems, one for the pools and one for the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The third plaintiff testified that he only
                    discovered the distinction between the two systems when he was preparing his
                    affidavit of evidence in chief for the trial. This was incredible on the face of
                    it. In any case, when he was confronted with the transcripts of the meetings, he
                    confirmed that he had been aware that at the meetings, the previous MC had been
                    told about the two different systems based on different technologies and about
                    their different attributes. The second plaintiff was more straightforward. He
                    admitted knowing that two systems were being bought before the contract was
                    signed because he was told about it by Mr Phua. I find that by the time of
                    2008 AGM, all the plaintiffs were aware that the NWS and the MWS were different
                    systems. Therefore they had no business representing that only one system had
                    been purchased. In fact, they should have made it crystal clear to the members
                    that two different systems had been purchased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     What I said at the end of the last paragraph
                    is also relevant to the plaintiffs’ contention that they had dealt with
                    the problems with the Club’s swimming pools in a holistic fashion and had
                    taken a proactive approach to resolving these problems. However, that is not
                    what they told the members. Instead, they represented to the members that all of
                    the expenditure was spent to address the emergency. In particular, they did not
                    inform the members that only the competition pool required the emergency
                    expenditure. Their position at the 2008 AGM was that the expenditure was
                    incurred to deal with the filtration problems in the pools. This position did
                    not justify buying the MWS which had nothing to do with the pools’
                    filtration system and this was probably why the impression was given that only
                    one system was purchased which gave the “additional” benefit of
                    providing mineral water in the Jacuzzis. There was also a great deal of
                    controversy over whether the NWS itself was a water filtration system, but I do
                    not need to determine that point. In court, the plaintiffs accepted that an
                    emergency did not give them the right to purchase items that were not connected
                    with such emergency. Their failure to disclose to the meeting that part of the
                    expenditure did not address the emergency must have been
                deliberate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The plaintiffs suggested that they had spent
                    $168,800 because they believed that they were buying a package from TWC. There
                    was, however, no suggestion by TWC during its presentation that it was selling
                    the Club a package. On the contrary, Mr Rawle testified that if the
                    previous MC had requested that TWC installed the NWS only for the competition
                    pool, it would have been agreeable. The first plaintiff himself testified that
                    he knew it was possible for the Club to buy the equipment for the competition
                    pool first. In any case, the “package” explanation would only be
                    relevant if the plaintiffs had been informed that the Club would be given a
                    discount only if it bought the entire package. The transcript of the
                    10 November 2007 meeting, however, makes it clear that the previous MC was
                    not told any such thing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was also clear from the evidence that the
                    Auto-Dozers had nothing to do with the filtration system of the pools. It was
                    not disputed that they were not relevant to solving the emergency. The first two
                    plaintiffs agreed that these items were not essential for the functioning of the
                    NWS or for resolving the chokage of the competition pool’s sand filter
                    though the second plaintiff maintained that the previous MC did not know until
                    very recently that the Auto-Dozers did not address the emergency. He agreed,
                    though, in the light of what he now knew, it was not possible to justify the
                    purchase of the Auto-Dozers as an emergency expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The plaintiffs’ pleaded case was that
                    they were not aware that the expenditure included the Auto-Dozers. The
                    plaintiffs’ stand that they knew about the Auto-Dozers only in 2009 is,
                    however, contradicted by the transcript of the 10 November 2007 meeting.
                    The transcript records that Mr Rawle had recommended that the Club add
                    “an on-demand chlorination system, which is a system that reads your
                    water”. The plaintiffs must therefore have known that what was being sold
                    to them included the Auto-Dozers. When the first plaintiff was shown this
                    transcript, he said that he knew at the time of the presentation that TWC was
                    offering the Auto-Dozers as something extra. It should be noted that the
                    transcript also shows that the first plaintiff had asked questions about the
                    Auto-Dozers during the meeting. In the light of all the evidence, it is safe to
                    infer that the plaintiffs had a general idea about the use of the Auto-Dozers
                    and knew that they had nothing to do with the filtration problem. Yet, they
                    sanctioned the purchase and, more than that, did not explain to the members that
                    this equipment was an optional extra which had no connection with the emergency.
                    It may be worth mentioning that in the event the Auto-Dozers could not be used
                    because the contract did not include two essential components: the chemical
                    tanks and stirrers. The Club ended up paying for useless pieces of equipment but
                    I am satisfied that at the material time the plaintiffs were not aware of that
                    aspect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiffs maintained that they did not
                    see the contract that was signed with TWC as this was a matter that they left in
                    the hands of the general manager. Therefore, they were not aware that the
                    Auto-Dozers were being bought or that they cost $19,400. If the plaintiffs are
                    to be believed, they authorised the expenditure without knowing what the total
                    sum of $168,800 covered or how it was made up. I find that hard to credit. Even
                    if I accepted that to be the case, I agree with the defendant’s submission
                    that in that event, the plaintiffs would have been reckless in representing to
                    the members that the entire expenditure was necessary to resolve the
                    emergency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The fourth plaintiff in particular seems to
                    have been very careless in this regard. He claimed that he did not know of the
                    existence of the Auto-Dozers and this was because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     When the previous MC approved the
                        expenditure, he had no idea what comprised the system that was being
                        purchased from TWC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     When Mr Rawle recommended the Auto-Dozers, he was not
                        interested; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although it was the previous MC’s decision to purchase the system and
                        he agreed that it must understand what was being offered before agreeing to
                        purchase the same, he did not understand what was being bought and did not
                        ask any questions about it. His position was that it was the general
                        manager’s duty to get everything straightened out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In these circumstances, it would appear that he was happy to go along with
                    whatever was said by the other plaintiffs and the general manager to obtain
                    ratification of the expenditure even though he himself did not know whether the
                    system and all the components purchased were needed to solve the emergency. That
                    makes him equally culpable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Addition of chemicals to the pool water</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It was reported in the Annual Report that
                    after the installation of the NWS the Club’s swimming pools did not
                    require the addition of chemicals. Evidence given for the plaintiffs showed that
                    the amount of chlorine added to the swimming pools was reduced by a maximum of
                    32.5% after the NWS was installed. This meant that the pools were still dozed
                    with 67.5% of the amount of chlorine that they had previously received.
                    Obviously, chlorine still needed to be added even though the NWS was in
                    operation. The plaintiffs explained that the regulations of the National
                    Environment Agency (“NEA”) require chlorine to be added to all
                    swimming pools in Singapore and the Club was adding the minimum required.
                    However, the statement in the Annual Report was categorical. It read
                    “Furthermore, [NWS] does away with the need for chemical
                    additives”. Such a statement must have given members the impression that
                    no more chemicals were being added to the pools.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It was not right to give the members such an
                    impression because the previous MC must have known that whilst the NWS was being
                    touted as reducing the need for chemicals, they had been specifically informed
                    by Mr Rawle at the 10 November 2007 meeting that even with the NWS,
                    the pool would have to “maintain at least a 1% chlorine that the NEA
                    requires” and in any case the purpose of the Auto Dozers was to provide
                    the requisite chlorination. The first plaintiff as a swimmer for several years
                    was also aware that chlorine was a compulsory addition to swimming
                pools.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Although in the context of what happened, the
                    representation as to the reduced need for chlorine after the installation of the
                    NWS was a minor misrepresentation, I think that the plaintiffs deliberately made
                    this representation in order to emphasise the benefits of the new system and
                    encourage ratification. It would be noted that in his speech quoted in <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above, the first plaintiff emphasised that
                    the smell of chlorine and the dangers of hair being bleached and skin being
                    reddened, had all been done away with by the new system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Representation that the NWS provided mineral water</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Annual Report stated that as a result of
                    the system purchased by the Club, the members of the Club were able to
                    “enjoy the benefits of mineral water in [the Club’s] swimming pools
                    and Jacuzzis”. By the end of the trial, it was not in dispute that the
                    NWS did not result in there being mineral water in the Club’s pools and
                    that the mineral water in the Jacuzzis resulted from the installation of the MWS
                    in those facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendant submitted that the statement in
                    the Annual Report was a deliberate misrepresentation. He pointed out that the
                    transcript of TWC’s presentation made on 10 November 2007 showed that
                    the plaintiffs had not been informed that mineral water would result from the
                    NWS. The plaintiffs had not explained why this statement regarding the presence
                    of mineral water in the pools had been made. Therefore, the defendant submitted,
                    the only inference that could be drawn would be that this was a deliberate
                    embellishment on the part of the plaintiffs on the benefits of the NWS to
                    convince the members to ratify the expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The statement in question appeared in the
                    section of the Annual Report on the work of the Facilities Department. It was
                    drafted by the staff but vetted by the third plaintiff who was the Facilities
                    Chairman. In court, the third plaintiff was questioned about this statement. He
                    agreed that as it stood, it was not accurate but maintained that this was
                    because certain words had been left out and testified that the relevant portion
                    of the sentence should have read “enjoy the benefits of <em>natural and</em> mineral water in our swimming pools and
                    Jacuzzis”. On further questioning, he did not agree that even with the
                    amendment, the sentence would still give the impression that there was only one
                    system that provided both natural and mineral water. In the third
                    plaintiff’s view, if the words “natural and” had been added
                    to the sentence, it would have been clear to all members that the Club had
                    bought two different systems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The third plaintiff would have me believe that
                    it was a careless mistake that resulted in the misleading statement in the
                    Annual Report. He would also have me believe that his command of English is such
                    that he honestly thought that simply adding the words “natural
                    and” would convey the message that two separate systems had been bought.
                    It is difficult to believe this when the full context of the statement is
                    considered. The material portion of the paragraph in which it appeared reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Sub-Committee decided to install a brand new filtration system
                        incorporating Hydrosmart Technology. This system adds resonance frequencies
                        to the water making it soft, removes scales and prevents algae. Furthermore
                        it does away with the need for chemical additives. Members now enjoy the
                        benefits of mineral water in our swimming pools and jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is plain from the full context that the members were being told
                    that one system alone had been purchased. The system was referred to as
                    “it” in the singular and “this system”. Nothing in
                    the paragraph indicated that two systems had been purchased and, therefore, if
                    the words “natural and” had been added to the last sentence,
                    members would have thought that the single system purchased was capable of
                    delivering two different types of water. They would not have thought that two
                    systems had been bought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Given that the third plaintiff knew by April
                    2008 that two different systems had been purchased, the defendant contended that
                    the statement was a deliberate misrepresentation emphasising the benefits that
                    the members had gained from the expenditure but hiding the fact that two systems
                    had had to be purchased in order to provide such a benefit and that the system
                    for the Jacuzzis did not address any emergency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The plaintiffs on the other hand submitted
                    that while there might have been some inaccuracies in the Annual Report about
                    the MWS and the NWS, the Annual Report simply formed part of the previous
                    MC’s update to the members about the new facilities installed at the Club
                    and was not material to ratification. The material document relating to
                    ratification was Appendix D and the heading in this document stated
                    unequivocally and prominently in the heading that two systems were installed for
                    the pools and Jacuzzis. There was no attempt to conceal any facts or to mislead
                    Club members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is true that the heading of item 1 of
                    Appendix D read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To ratify the expenditure of $168k for the installation of the Natural
                        Water System in our pools and a Mineral Water System in our Jacuzzis</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That heading if taken by itself would have clearly informed the
                    members that two separate systems had been purchased. However, the four
                    paragraphs of explanation that followed the heading were not so clear. The first
                    sentence of the second paragraph read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At about the same time Water Consultants Pte Ltd were promoting their new
                        water technology that would produce natural water for our pools and mineral
                        water for our Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This sentence gave an impression of one type of technology producing
                    two results though careful readers who compared the heading with the sentence
                    may have thought that the phrase “new water technology” referred
                    to two systems, not one. However, such interpretation would have been
                    contradicted immediately if such readers went on to read the first sentence of
                    the third paragraph which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Water Consultants offered to install the Natural Water System for both our
                        pools as well as our Jacuzzis at a cost of SGD$168k.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The implication of that sentence was that the NWS was the only system
                    being acquired. This impression would have been reinforced by the following
                    sentences of the third paragraph which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">GM was asked to check the background of the company and get some form of
                        guarantee from their principal. After securing the necessary documents and
                        assurances the contract was awarded to Water Consultants Pte Ltd on
                        28 November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second sentence of the third paragraph in particular indicated
                    that there was only one principal behind TWC who gave a guarantee. Finally, in
                    the last paragraph of this item, a reference was made to the NWS as being able
                    to break up the hardened sand in the filters thus obviating the need to
                    sandblast the sand filters. Apart from the title, there was not a single mention
                    of the MWS in the four paragraphs explaining the expenditure. Thus, the overall
                    picture that a member reading item 1 of Appendix D would have had was that a
                    single system was purchased which provided the benefits of natural water for the
                    pools and mineral water for the Jacuzzis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The wrongful impression given by the statement
                    in the Annual Report would thus have been reinforced rather than corrected by
                    Appendix D. I find that there was a misrepresentation in the Annual Report and
                    it was deliberate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Representations as to due diligence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     At the 2008 AGM, Mr Phua made the
                    following statements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    “... we have done a thorough study on this,
                            and we have also got all the pros and cons of the system ... But uh, you
                            can rest assured that the people we got in have convinced us thoroughly
                            on the system ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    “... the Committee I must say, took all the
                            precautions to make sure that the system works and is reliable.
                            We’ve got the principals of the company giving us guarantee letter
                            etc etc etc. So rest assured we have done our homework before we launch
                            into this water system.”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    “Well we’ve checked the company,
                            it’s an independent private (co) and company, private listed
                            company, Water Consultant Pte Ltd. They are the sole agents for this
                            particular system in Singapore and Southeast Asia. So we contacted their
                            principals, the one invented this system in Australia, and they’ve
                            given us documents to say that it works and it’s guaranteed, and
                            that they’ve even given us a guarantee over the guarantee given to
                            us by Water Consultants, that should Water Consultants go kaput for
                            example, they will take over and provide us the
                            guarantee.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Additionally, on the question of the
                    investigations done prior to purchase of the NSW, the first plaintiff
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    “we were concerned, and we did the best we
                            could to find various references uh, as well as due diligence, we
                            contacted the manufacturers who gave us guarantees that should the local
                            distributor fail to deliver, they would back up the local distributor on
                            this particular issue and so on and so forth.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    in the month or so that ensued [after the
                            Competition Pool was closed], we went through the routine that you
                            already know about and finally decided on this particular system
                            ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The defendant submitted that since the
                    previous MC did not correct Mr Phua’s statements at the 2008 AGM,
                    members had been given the impression that they endorsed what he had said.
                    Further, the first plaintiff had admitted in court that when he made the
                    statement in [80(a)] above, his intention was to convince members that adequate
                    due diligence had been carried out. In the defendant’s view, however, the
                    facts established that the due diligence was shoddy, that the plaintiffs had
                    decided immediately after the 10 November 2007 meeting to purchase the
                    system and had not applied their minds to its adequacy. Further, whilst the
                    plaintiffs had testified that they left the due diligence to the staff and had
                    relied on Mr Phua to discharge his duties properly, this is not what they
                    had told the members of the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The first point that the defendant made to
                    substantiate the assertions above was that the decision to purchase the NWS was
                    not made on 6 December 2007 but much earlier. This was evidenced by the
                    transcript of the 10 November 2007 meeting which contained a discussion of
                    how to pay for the system followed by an instruction to Mr Phua to
                    “build up a case” to justify the expenditure as an emergency. The
                    defendant also pointed out that the minutes of that meeting had stated that
                    “after consideration, MC approved the installation of the system at a
                    cost of $168,800”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The plaintiffs’ position was that the
                    decision made on 10 November 2007 was only an “in principle”
                    approval of the purchase. There are, however, certain documents which cast doubt
                    on this assertion:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 12 November 2007 Sylvia Chan
                        sent Richard Phua an e-mail thanking him, his team and the MC for awarding
                        the contract to TWC and stating that the contract would be sent over for
                        signature;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        contract dated 12 November 2007 entered into between the Club and TWC;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a>(c)     An
                        “Addendum to Sales Agreement dated 12 November 2007” with
                        the number “12” struck out and replaced with a
                        “23” which was subsequently signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    documents above appear to indicate that there was a binding contract for the
                    purchase of the NWS and MWS from TWC on or shortly after 12 November
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiffs, however, pointed out that the
                    payment terms were not settled from the beginning. In the 12 November 2007
                    document, a 60% down-payment was to be made prior to the equipment supply and
                    pipe work fabrication, followed by a 25% progress payment upon installation,
                    then six percent payment a month after installation and a final payment of ten
                    percent upon commissioning of the natural water pool and satisfactory
                    decalcification of the filters. After a meeting that took place on
                    19 November 2007, the payment terms were modified so that there was a ten
                    percent down-payment followed by a 50% payment upon the supply of the equipment,
                    whilst the progress payment was changed from 25% to 20% and the payment a month
                    after installation was raised from five to ten percent. Additionally, there was
                    a change in the warranty to be provided by TWC which was reflected in the
                    Addendum to the Sales Agreement. Further, at the management committee meeting
                    held on 27 November 2007, Mr Phua asked for approval for the signing
                    of the contract with TWC thus indicating to the previous MC that the contract
                    was still to be concluded. No approval was given as the previous MC still wanted
                    Mr Phua to obtain a guarantee from TWC that the pool water would pass
                    “local standards”. It was at the next meeting, held on
                    6 December 2007, that Mr Phua informed the previous MC that he had
                    managed to secure a limited warranty provision in the contract and again asked
                    for approval to sign the contract. The previous MC then gave him the green
                    light. The previous MC had not given Mr Phua any authority to sign any
                    contract until the conclusion of this meeting and it was not aware that
                    Mr Phua had signed a contract prior to that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     On this issue, I accept the evidence of the
                    plaintiffs that as far as they were concerned, whilst they were very
                    enthusiastic about the new technology after TWC’s presentation on
                    10 November 2007, they had not authorised Mr Phua to enter a binding
                    contract at that stage. Thus, when he signed the quotation of 12 November
                    2007, he did so without authority (although since TWC was not aware of that lack
                    of authority, the contract would still have bound the Club). Mr Phua was
                    questioned about this in court and he was unable to give a coherent explanation
                    as to why he had entered into a binding contract with TWC on or about
                    12 November 2007. Whilst technically this action on the part of
                    Mr Phua means that the contract was not concluded after a month long study,
                    the previous MC was not aware of these facts and indeed the existence of the
                    12 November 2007 contract was not discovered until the yellow file came to
                    light. To the previous MC’s knowledge at the time of the 2008 AGM, there
                    was only one contract between the Club and TWC and that was the one signed on
                    7 December 2007. Accordingly, I find that it was not a deliberate
                    misrepresentation on the part of the previous MC to tell the members at the 2008
                    AGM that the contract was only signed after a month long due diligence effort
                    had been made. As far as the previous MC was concerned, this statement was
                    true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Apart from the period of due diligence, the
                    defendant submitted that the statements of the first plaintiff and Mr Phua
                    quoted contained untrue representations to the effect that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     The previous MC had obtained
                        satisfactory warranties from the principals, Hydrosmart and
                    Carefree;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     That they
                        had carried out research into the NWS; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     That there were third party endorsements of the
                        NWS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will deal with these allegations in
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As regards the warranties, to paraphrase the
                    statement made by Mr Phua and quoted at [79(c)] above, what he was telling
                    the members was that the Club had contacted the principals of TWC and had been
                    given documents to say that the system worked and had even obtained a guarantee
                    from the principals that if TWC was to go bankrupt, the principals would take
                    over and carry out the terms of the guarantee given by TWC. This message was
                    reinforced by the first plaintiff’s statement quoted at [80(a)] above,
                    which was to the effect that the manufacturers of the system had given the Club
                    guarantees that should TWC fail to deliver, they would back up
                TWC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The warranty given by Hydrosmart, the
                    manufacturer of the NWS, is addressed to “To whom it may concern”.
                    The first few paragraphs deal with the appointment of TWC as the exclusive
                    distributor for the NWS in Singapore and praise the knowledge and ability of
                    TWC. The only part of the letter that can be construed as a warranty is the
                    ninth paragraph which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would be dismayed if they would walk way [<em>sic</em>] after all the investment in time, energy and finance.
                        However, should the unlikely situation take place we would definitely put
                        into place a support system to cope with all installations and honour the 5
                        year warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The warranty given by Carefree is also
                    addressed to “To whom it may concern”. It too has several
                    paragraphs dealing with the ability of TWC and the confidence that Carefree had
                    in it as Carefree’s Asia Pacific exclusive distributors. The material
                    paragraphs relating to the warranty are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Carefree Clearwater provides the Lifetime product warranty for all the
                        systems that are sold and installed by [TWC] in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is unlikely that [TWC] directors would walk away from a fast growing
                        business that they have nurtured from its embryonic stage, through
                        accumulated technical knowledge, their wealth of marketing expertise and
                        their financial investment. The Green movement is here to stay. In the
                        unlikely event, we would definitely arrange for support infrastructure in
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The defendant submitted that it was plainly
                    untrue that satisfactory warranties had been obtained from the principals
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     The warranties were not addressed to
                        the Club but to “To whom it may concern”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, both warranties were
                        hopelessly vague and indicated that at the time of writing there was no
                        support structure available in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     No steps were taken to look into the financial
                        standing of the principals and as it turned out, Hydrosmart had a paid up
                        capital of only A$100.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     The principals were not based in Singapore and this would
                        make enforcement of the warranties difficult. In any event, the lack of
                        financial standing of the principals suggested that enforcement proceedings
                        would be futile and therefore the warranties served no useful
                        purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Looking at the statements made by the first
                    plaintiff and Mr Phua, I think it is difficult to categorise them as
                    misrepresentations. It was true that the Club had obtained letters of support
                    from both principals concerned. The defendant’s point about the letters
                    not being addressed directly to the Club at the outset was not a substantial one
                    since a specific reference was made to the Club in each letter in the context of
                    welcoming the Club as a purchaser and user of the system concerned. Therefore,
                    it was apparent that the principals knew whom they were writing to and to whom
                    their assurances of support were being given. It was also true that the
                    Hydrosmart letter specifically agreed to honour the five year warranty for the
                    NWS given by TWC in the event that TWC folded up as Mr Phua had told the
                    meeting. I do not consider that undertaking to be hopelessly vague. Further, the
                    speakers did not hide from the meeting the fact that the principals were
                    companies located overseas. Reasonable members would have realised that
                    difficulties may be encountered if the Club sought to enforce the warranties
                    against foreigners. The first plaintiff admitted in court the previous MC had
                    taken the warranties at face value without considering the practicalities of
                    enforcement but, in my view, in doing this they probably acted little
                    differently from many consumers who buy fairly expensive systems for their
                    homes. The point is that it is apparent from the evidence that the previous MC
                    did push the general manager to obtain guarantees from TWC’s principals
                    and was not satisfied simply to rely on TWC in respect of this new technology.
                    In any event, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs were not being deceitful in the
                    information they gave the general meeting about the warranties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The next representation relied on was
                    Mr Phua’s comment that a thorough study had been done on the NWS and
                    the “pros and cons of the system” had been obtained. This is
                    quoted at [79(a)] above. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs were aware of
                    what studies had been carried out and did not correct Mr Phua’s
                    statement even though they knew that no proper research had been done in respect
                    of the NWS. In this connection, the second plaintiff agreed that due diligence
                    had to be done in relation to how the NWS worked. For himself, he did this by
                    listening to the presentation given by TWC and also checked with Mr Phua to
                    clarify a few points on the effectiveness of the system. He did not read the
                    material relating to the system himself as he considered that that would only be
                    necessary if he had doubts regarding it. On the whole, he relied on the
                    investigations done by Mr Phua. A similar position was taken by the third
                    plaintiff who said that he did not go into the details because he did not think
                    that that was his duty since he took it that both the full-time staff and
                    Facilities Sub-committee had done so. The fourth plaintiff confirmed in court
                    that he had taken TWC’s presentation at face value and had not done any
                    independent checks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In the light of the above evidence and on the
                    plaintiffs’ own case, it is clear that they left the issue of due
                    diligence entirely up to Mr Phua because these were operational matters for
                    him to look at. The defendant argued that that was not good enough because they
                    had given the members the impression that they themselves had done a thorough
                    study. I do not agree. I do not think that the members would have expected the
                    individual members of the previous MC to do detailed due diligence on their own.
                    It would have been understood that this would be work for the professional
                    management under the charge of Mr Phua. The previous MC had instructed
                    Mr Phua to negotiate with TWC for better contract terms and to carry out
                    checks on the company. Knowing that TWC’s systems were new to the market,
                    they had discussed ways in which the Club could be protected should TWC cease
                    operation and had directed Mr Phua to contact TWC’s principals for
                    added security. They had also asked for references and had been provided with
                    some. At the meeting held on 27 November 2007, they had received
                    Mr Phua’s reports on the results of the various checks that he had
                    made including the bank statement he had received confirming TWC’s bank
                    credit. At the end of this meeting, Mr Phua was instructed to carry out
                    further checks on the principals and it was only after receiving a satisfactory
                    report from Mr Phua on 6 December 2007 that the previous MC authorised
                    the execution of the contract. The previous MC believed that Mr Phua had
                    taken all necessary steps in the due diligence process and therefore were not
                    wrong in failing to correct his statement. It should also be noted that the
                    Audit Committee’s findings were that the prescribed procedures had been
                    followed and that the selection process in relation to TWC was in order. Whether
                    a due diligence exercise has been properly performed is to some extent a
                    question of perspective and a subjective matter. In this particular case, it was
                    easy in hindsight to find holes in the process but I do not think that such
                    holes were so obvious at the material time as to alert the previous MC that it
                    would be wrong in relying on the reports of Mr Phua.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The third representation was that the previous
                    MC had obtained third party endorsements of the NWS. The defendant noted that
                    this was a key concern of the members present at the AGM and that in court the
                    plaintiffs had agreed that this was a legitimate concern of the members and
                    would be important to them in deciding on ratification. One of the members, a
                    Mr Ken Lee, had asked whether matters relating to the efficacy of the NWS
                    were a representation from the vendors or the finding of an expert. Subsequently
                    he asked whether there were any third party opinions on the system. Mr Phua
                    then informed the meeting that referrals from the YMCA in the U.S. had been
                    obtained and that he had also spoken to Marina Mandarin Hotel whose swimming
                    pool used the system and the Negara Hotel. When further queries were raised,
                    Mr Phua told the meeting that he had a letter from the Marina Mandarin
                    Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The evidence was, however, that none of the
                    organisations referred to had used the NWS. The feedback from the YMCA, New
                    Jersey, USA was in relation to the MWS. The Marina Mandarin Hotel and the Negara
                    Hotel had also installed the MWS, and not the NWS. The letter from the Marina
                    Mandarin Hotel dated 13 November 2007 was shown to the previous MC by
                    Mr Phua on 27 November 2007 and the same expressly referred to the
                    Carefree ionization system which had created “a mineral water swimming
                    pool”. When Mr Phua told the 2008 AGM that he had a letter of
                    reference from the Marina Mandarin Hotel, the clear impression given was that
                    this reference was for the NWS. That was the wrong impression and it should have
                    been corrected by members of the previous MC. None of them did so. The issue of
                    the references was raised several times during the meeting and the Marina
                    Mandarin Hotel was referred to more than once, but at no time was it clarified
                    that the third party endorsement was for the MWS used by the Jacuzzis and not
                    for the NWS installed in the pools. I agree that the plaintiffs endorsed or
                    permitted a deliberate misrepresentation in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of findings on representations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I have held that the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the First and Second Statements was that the plaintiffs had
                    intentionally misrepresented to the members that it was necessary to replace the
                    water filtration system on the basis that it was urgent and/or an emergency in
                    order to justify the expenditure and obtain ratification of the
                same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I have found that the plaintiffs made the
                    following representations to the members despite knowing that they were untrue
                    in order to obtain ratification of the expenditure:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the whole of the expenditure
                        was required to address an emergency;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     That after the installation of the NWS, the swimming
                        pools did not require the addition of chemicals;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the NWS provided mineral water to
                        the pools; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_d"></a>(d)     That third party endorsements had been obtained in respect of the
                        NSW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Accordingly, I hold that the defendant has
                    justified the gist of the defamatory sting and is not liable to the plaintiffs
                    for defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In view of my findings above in relation to
                    justification, I do not need to go on to consider the further defence of
                    qualified privilege and whether this defence would have been defeated by the
                    presence of malice on the part of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I therefore dismiss the plaintiffs’
                    claim with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"> </p>
