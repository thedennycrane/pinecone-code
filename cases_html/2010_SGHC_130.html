<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the plaintiff, Gammon
                    Pte Limited, for an injunction to restrain the defendant, JBE Properties Pte
                    Ltd, from receiving payment from BNP Paribas Singapore on a performance
                    bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant is a developer and the owner of a
                    building at 6 Handy Road (“the Building”). By a letter of award
                    dated 19 January 2006, the defendant engaged the plaintiff to construct the
                    Building for a sum of $11,515,000. SCDA Architects Pte Ltd
                    (“SCDA”) was engaged as the architect and the superintending
                    officer for the works. The contractual completion date was 17 May 2007.
                    However, SCDA certified an extension of the completion date to 16 August
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       During the period between 12 October 2007
                    and 7 January 2008, defects with the façade cladding of the building were
                    highlighted to the plaintiff through the issuance of superintendent officer
                    instructions (“SOIs”). The plaintiff undertook to rectify these
                    defects in its letter dated 28 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 12 February 2008, SCDA issued the
                    completion certificate certifying completion on 16 January 2008
                    (“completion certificate”). Enclosed with the completion
                    certificate was a schedule of 52 outstanding classes of defects. To date, not
                    all the defects have been rectified by the plaintiff. Owing to the
                    plaintiff’s failure to remedy the outstanding defects despite several
                    reminders by the defendant, the defendant called on the performance bond on 6
                    and 27 February 2009 to fund the completion of the rectification work to be
                    done by other contractors engaged by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The performance bond</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The relevant terms of the on-demand performance
                    bond excerpted in the defendant’s submissions are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now in consideration of the Employer not insisting on the Management
                        Contractor paying ten (10) percent of the total value of the Contract as a
                        security deposit for the said Contract, we (at the request of the Management
                        Contractor) hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    In the event of the Management Contractor failing
                            to fulfil any of the terms and conditions of the said contract, we shall
                            indemnify the Employer against all losses, damages, costs, expenses or
                            otherwise sustained by the Employer thereby up to the sum of Singapore
                            Dollars One Million, One Hundred and Fifty One Thousand and Five Hundred
                            Only (S$1,151,500.00) (“the Guaranteed Sum”) upon
                            receiving your written notice of claim for payment made pursuant to
                            Clause 4 hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    We shall not be discharged or released from this
                            guarantee by any arrangement between yourself and the Management
                            Contractor with or without our consent or by any alteration in the
                            obligations undertaken by the Management Contractor or by any
                            forbearance whether as to payment, time, performance or
                            otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    This guarantee is conditional upon a claim or
                            direction as specified herein being made by you by way of a notice in
                            writing addressed to us and the same being received by us at 20 Collyer
                            Quay #04-01 Tung Centre Singapore 049319 within 180 days from the expiry
                            of this guarantee…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    We shall be obliged to effect the payment required
                            under such a claim or direction within 30 business days of our receipt
                            thereof. We shall be under no duty to inquire into the reasons,
                            circumstances or authenticity of the grounds for such claim or direction
                            and shall be entitled to rely upon any written notice thereof received
                            by us (within the period specified in Clause 4 hereof) as final and
                            conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Unconscionability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff did not dispute that there were
                    outstanding defects but alleged that it would be unconscionable for the
                    defendant to call on the performance bond. It is settled law in Singapore that
                    in addition to fraud, an injunction to restrain a call on a performance bond may
                    be granted on the ground of unconscionability. Whether unconscionability can be
                    established largely depends on the factual matrix of each case.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The concept of ‘unconscionability’ to me involves
                        unfairness, as distinct from dishonesty or fraud, or <em>conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith</em>
                        that a court of conscience would either restrain the party or refuse to
                        assist the party. <em>Mere breaches of contract by the party
                            in question … would not by themselves be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant justified the call on the
                    performance bond on the basis that the outstanding sum due to it was
                    $1,820,198.59 (which included a sum of $2,200,800 as the cost of rectification
                    of the cladding defects).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In my view, the plaintiff had shown a strong
                    prima facie case of unconscionability. The glaring item was defendant’s
                    claim of $2,200,800 for the rectification of cladding defects in SOI 266/08 and
                    SOI 271/08 which according to the defendant was awarded to Weng Thai
                    Construction (“WTC”) on 10 February 2009. The plaintiff alleged
                    that the award to WTC was a sham. The letter of award was a one page document
                    with no scope of work detailed at all. No time frame to carry out the work
                    was specified. The method of rectification was not stipulated. The address of
                    WTC was an HDB flat which appeared to be owned and occupied by one Mr Teoh
                    Weng Thai. WTC did not appear to have any expertise in design, fabrication and
                    installation of cladding. WTC operated as a sole proprietor and was owned by
                    someone not known in the industry. WTC’s incompetence in carrying out the
                    rectification works was confirmed by its supposed intention to appoint another
                    entity, CLK Systems Pte Ltd, to carry out the work. The price of $2,200,800 for
                    the contract awarded to WTC was wholly out of proportion to the value of the
                    works. By comparison, the sub-contract awarded to Seiko for the design, supply
                    and installation of the curtain wall and glazing works was for only $1,690,000.
                    The portion to design, fabricate, supply and install the aluminium panel
                    cladding for the whole façade of the building was only S$371,664. However, the
                    price quoted by WTC for merely rectifying the defects to the aluminium panel
                    cladding was a hefty six times more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I concluded that WTC’s tender price of
                    S$2.2 million essentially to repair some 83 relatively minor cladding defects
                    was astronomical and grossly inflated so as to enable the defendant to justify
                    the call on the full sum of the performance bond. Serious questions had crossed
                    my mind as to whether there was collusion between the defendant and WTC in this
                    regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the plaintiff, the defendant
                    still had not paid the plaintiff the following sums:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On top of this sum due to the plaintiff, the
                    defendant still sought to call on the performance bond for a further sum of
                    S$1,151,500. The total amount in excess of $2.9m which the defendant claimed the
                    plaintiff owed primarily for defective works amounted to more than 25% of the
                    original contract value of $11,515,000, which the defendant awarded to the
                    plaintiff to construct the <em>entire</em> building. It
                    would in my view be most surprising that SCDA would have issued a completion
                    certificate certifying that the works were in all respects completed (save for
                    52 minor outstanding works) when some $2.9 m worth of rectification works
                    remained outstanding if the defendant were to be believed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This indicated to me that there was gross
                    exaggeration of the costs of rectification of outstanding defects made in
                    support of the defendant’s call on the bond. A call on the performance
                    bond in this fashion was clearly unconscionable, abusive and bordered on being
                    fraudulent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 44, the Court of Appeal addressed an instance where the call
                    would be unconscionable at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... We are concerned with <em>abusive</em> calls on
                        the bonds. It should not be forgotten that a performance bond can be used as
                        an oppressive instrument, and in the event that a beneficiary calls on the
                        bond in circumstances, where there is <em>prima
                            facie</em> evidence of fraud or unconscionability, the court
                        should step in to intervene at the interlocutory stage until the whole of
                        the circumstances of the case has been investigated. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the course of the hearing, I asked the
                    plaintiff to obtain quotations so that a comparison could be made with
                    WTC’s tender price. The quotations obtained by the plaintiff were so much
                    lower than those obtained by the defendant. Five quotations were obtained and
                    the highest of those was $560,000 based on a total replacement of the panels.
                    The next highest quotation was $335,000 based on repairing the panels. These
                    were nowhere near the amount quoted by WTC. These huge discrepancies confirmed
                    my belief that WTC’s price of $2,200,800 for the panel repairs had been
                    grossly inflated. I had grave doubts that WTC’s quotation for the
                    rectification work obtained by the defendant was not a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Orders made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, I made the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Call on the bond is to be deferred
                        until further order, with liberty to apply;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     All rectification works to be completed by the
                        plaintiff within 6 months. Inspection of rectification work to be carried
                        out in the month of October 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Any dispute on the quality of the rectification works in
                        accordance with the warranty will be determined by the court. If the court
                        determines that the rectification works in accordance with the standard set
                        out in the warranty is not satisfied, the court may direct that, subject to
                        call on the bond, a joint tender be carried out in order to rectify the
                        balance of the unrectified defects as determined by the court. The
                        completion of the balance of rectification works, through the joint tender,
                        shall be deemed to be in accordance with the standard set out in the
                        warranty. The specifications for the contractors for the joint tender, shall
                        be the original specifications for the works; and</p>
