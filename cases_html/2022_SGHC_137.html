Further, the present facts are exceptional as the suspension of HTLI’s business is directly attributable to the judicial managers’ conduct in controlling the company since 5 May 2020.

The purposes of judicial management are limited to the statutory objectives listed under s 227B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act (now under s 89(1) of the IRDA) and this includes: (a) ensuring the survival of the company, or the whole or part of its undertaking, as a going concern, (b) obtaining approval of a compromise or an arrangement between the company and the relevant persons, (c) obtaining a more advantageous realisation of the company’s assets or property than on a winding up. These purposes are meant to be exhaustive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The protection of the corporate rescue is not one of those objectives.

</div> It may be thought that where the company had been rehabilitated to solvency, as in this case, the purpose of the judicial management has been achieved and the company should not be wound up. Instead, the company should be returned to the shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Nevertheless, I note that there is nothing inherent in the language of s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the IRDA which limits the grounds for winding up which may be relied upon by the judicial managers. This is in contrast to the Minister’s position under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA where certain prescribed grounds in s 125(1) of the IRDA are expressly stated, and also in relation to a contributory under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA where restrictions are set out in s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). This would suggest that the judicial manager is not limited to any specific ground of winding up, other than the one excluded ground in s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where there is a default made by the company in lodging a statutory report or holding the statutory meeting (by virtue of s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39  The ability for the judicial manager to make an application to wind up a company was first introduced by way of an amendment to the previous s 253(1) of the Companies Act in the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 9/1986) via clause 57. The explanatory statement to the bill provided that: “Clause 57 amends section 253 and enables a judicial manager appointed under Part VIIIA to petition for a winding up”. However, no further mention of this amendment was made in the relevant parliamentary debates and speeches. All that can be gathered is that the judicial manager was given standing to petition for winding up and nothing suggests that this is limited to specific grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The only other restrictions on a petitioner’s right to apply for a winding up of the company are judge-made in nature. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Re Ah Yee Contractors (Pte) Ltd</span> [1987] SLR(R) 396, it was held at [11] that a fully-paid shareholder who applied to wind up a company on just and equitable grounds must show that he had a “tangible interest” in the relief sought, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the winding up. If there were no surplus assets left for distribution to the shareholder when the company was wound up (after payment of the company’s debts and liabilities), then the fully-paid shareholder is not entitled to present the petition (at [10]). That rule has since appeared to be overridden by Parliament under s 128(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. No equivalent rule had been developed in relation to judicial managers that there must be a “tangible interest” in the relief sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Thus, it would appear that a judicial manager has standing to petition to wind up a company on just and equitable grounds under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Public interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 There does not appear to be any other application in which a court has ordered a company to be wound up on the ground that it would be in the public interest to do so. There is no distinct ground of “public interest” present within the circumstances under which a company may be wound up under s 125(1) of the IRDA. However, it has been argued on occasion to be subsumed within the just and equitable ground, at least, within the Australian authorities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 An issue which arises is whether the presence of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA would prevent the judicial manager from relying on “public interest” as a basis for the petition.

That provision provides in the relevant part:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">124A Petition for winding up on grounds of public interest.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  Where it appears to the Secretary of State from—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  any report made or information obtained under Part XIV (except section 448A) of the Companies Act 1985 (company investigations, &amp;c.),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  any report made by inspectors under …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">that it is expedient in the public interest that a company should be wound up, he may present a petition for it to be wound up if the court thinks it just and equitable for it to be so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Secretary of State may present a petition for winding up where it is “expedient in the public interest” and the court “thinks it just and equitable” for it to do so. It has been held in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Millennium Advanced Technology Ltd </span>[2004] 1 WLR 2177 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Millennium</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that only the Secretary of State is entitled to present a petition under this section as he has been identified by Parliament as the guardian or promoter of the public interest (at [33]). Parliament intended that the Secretary of State should act as a filter on petitions presented in pursuance of the public interest (at [37]). Thus, it is not for other petitioners (such as the local authority and creditor in that case), to pursue their own perception of the public interest and petition for winding up on these grounds. Instead, those other petitioners should “[bring] the matters complained of to the attention of the Secretary of State” (at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Lubin, Rosen and Associated Ltd</span> [1975] 1 WLR 122 at 129, when petitioning for winding up under s 124A of the UK Insolvency Act (the predecessor provision in that case), the Secretary of State is necessarily acting not in his own interest but in the interests of the public at large. The court should give special weight to the views of the Secretary of State as he is a high officer of the State who is entrusted by Parliament to act in the public interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The position in Australia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Regarding the position under the Australian Corp Act, it has been noted by the author of <span class="font-italic">McPherson &amp; Keay's Law of Company Liquidation</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">McPherson &amp; Keay</span>”) at p 298 that s 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Australian Corp Act is similar to s 124A of the UK Insolvency Act. The equivalent provision in Australia empowers a court to make a winding-up order where the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has reported that it is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the public that the company be wound up:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">General grounds on which company may be wound up by Court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  The Court may order the winding up of a company if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h)  ASIC has stated in a report prepared under Division 1 of Part 3 of the ASIC Act that, in its opinion:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  the company cannot pay its debts and should be wound up; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  it is in the interests of the public, of the members, or of the creditors, that the company should be wound up; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, unlike the English position, despite the existence of s 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Australian Corp Act, it appears that grounds of public interests may be relied upon by petitioners other than the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Re JSSP Holdings Pty Ltd</span> [2021] VSC 33, the minority shareholder of the company sought to apply to wind up the company on the just and equitable ground (under the equivalent provision to Singapore’s s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA) and raised public interest considerations. The court was willing to consider the “risk to public interest that warrants protection” (at [14(i)]) when deciding whether a just and equitable winding-up order should be made. The court observed that the “relevant interests to be balanced can also extend beyond the parties and encompass the broader public interest” (at [16]) when determining the relative justice of a winding up. Thus, where it was found that the business operated by the company posed a real risk to public safety (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, having a poor record of injuries and operating without public liability insurance), it was held that the “safety of the community is a paramount public interest which would be protected by the making of a winding up order in this case” (at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Public entities other than the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are also entitled to raise public interest considerations. In <span class="font-italic">Casualife</span>, a case relied upon by the judicial managers in submissions (see above at [23]), the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation sought a winding-up petition in its capacity as a creditor (at [3]). The Deputy Commissioner brought the proceedings on the just and equitable ground (at [422]), but relied on public interest considerations (at [449]). The defendant companies argued that the Deputy Commissioner was not entitled to rely on public interest grounds as opposed to entities such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that is expressly charged with regulating corporate conduct (at [479]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">479 The defendants also submitted that the authorities relied upon by the Deputy Commissioner largely related to applications by ASIC or another public authority expressly charged with the power to regulate corporate conduct. Referring to comments by Santow J … that ‘The public interest in bringing insolvent companies to winding up can be pursued by others, in particular the Australian Securities Commission … ,’ the defendants submitted that the Deputy Commissioner, as a creditor, cannot rely on the public interest in the same way as ASIC. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court rejected that submission and accepted the position taken by the Deputy Commissioner “that there is a public interest factor to be taken account of in these circumstances” but that “there is a need to identify the aspects of the public interest that would be promoted by a winding up order” (at [488]). The court found that the Deputy Commissioner was entitled to raise public interests concerns about the company’s poor tax payment history and the company controller’s disdain for the obligation to pay tax (at [504]). In arriving at its decision, the court was willing to consider the public interest of due collection of revenue tax (at [488]), notwithstanding the fact that an entity other than the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was making the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The law in Singapore</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 If the English position is followed, then it could be argued that by virtue of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA, it is the Minister considering the report of the inspector appointed under the Companies Act who has been identified by Singapore’s Parliament to be the guardian of the public interest. Consequently, the judicial manager (or other categories of petitioners for that matter) will not have the standing to make a winding-up petition on public interest grounds. Conversely, if the Australian model is adopted, then petitioners other than the Minister considering the report of the inspector appointed under the Companies Act would have the standing to make public interest arguments (which can encompass a wide array of circumstances such as public safety).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To my mind, the English position should be followed, and the rationale espoused in <span class="font-italic">Re Millennium</span> ought to apply in Singapore. Public interest considerations can be wide-ranging and petitions have been filed for reasons such as: the affairs of a company being conducted fraudulently (<span class="font-italic">Re Golden Chemical Products Ltd</span> [1976] 3 WLR 1), the company being involved in an elaborate conspiracy to defraud customers (<span class="font-italic">Re Highfield Commodities Ltd</span> [1985] 1 WLR. 149), where the company has engaged in plainly unlawful activities (<span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Bell Davies Trading Ltd and another</span> [2005] 1 BCLC 516), and where a company was conducting a pyramid selling scheme (<span class="font-italic">Re Alpha Club (UK) Ltd</span> [2002] 2 BCLC 612). What can be observed is that these situations are manifold and laden with polycentric considerations. A petitioner, other than the Minister acting upon the report of the inspector appointed under the Companies Act, may not be the best filter for what would be in the best interests of the public when making a winding-up application on this ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 One other consideration is that Parliament appears to have demonstrated a desire to centralise petitions in the public interest through the Minister rather than private parties acting in their various capacities as contributories, creditors, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. There will be occasions where it is in the public interest that a solvent (even profitable) company would be wound up (<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> A Company No.007923 of 1994</span> [1995] 1 WLR 953 at 957). Reserving the role of the pursuer of public interest to a holder of a high office, subject to public scrutiny, ensures propriety and presumably reduces substantially the possibility of an inappropriate application being made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 While judicial managers are officers of the court,

</div> they would not have the same resources, or perspective as a holder of a high office, especially when compared to a Minister assisted with the report of the inspector appointed under the Companies Act. Furthermore, as noted in <span class="font-italic">McPherson &amp; Keay</span> (at p 301), it is “highly debateable as to whether it is possible to provide one definition of ‘the public interest’ for all circumstances, as it appears that the concept cannot be regarded as normative”, and hence, that task is best left to the Minister.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Additionally, a unique feature within the Singapore legislation is that, in addition to s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA, there is also the presence of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">n</span>) as a ground for winding up which would already encompass certain aspects of the public interest including where: “the company is being used for an unlawful purpose or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore or against national security or interest”. The predecessor provision was introduced by way of the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16/1983), and the explanatory statement provides that it was “to enable the Minister to petition for the winding up of a company which is already registered under the Act if it is being used for an unlawful purpose or against the national interest, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>”. It is clear that only the Minister has the standing to apply under this ground as well. The existence of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">n</span>) of the IRDA alongside s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) supports the proposition that for matters relating to the public interest, only the Minister may petition on such grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Thus, a petitioner should not pursue his own perception of public interest and make an application for winding up on public interest grounds. He should instead, following the approach in <span class="font-italic">Re Millennium</span> being applied <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, bring matters complained of to the attention of the Minister. Thus, the judicial managers in the present case do not have the standing to rely on the public interest ground when petitioning for winding up.

It cannot, to my mind, be sensibly extended to the present situation, which involves the interest of an investor or corporate rescuer. The gravamen of the complaint by the judicial managers and the Creditor is that the Shareholders may try to unwind and invalidate the Share Sale. That would, in turn, nullify and waste the US$100 million investment given as consideration by the corporate rescuer, Golden Hill.

</div> The starting point is that the words “just and equitable” in s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IRDA (previously under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act) are words of the widest significance and do not limit the jurisdiction of the court to any case (<span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi and another</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 at [14] citing <span class="font-italic">In re Blériot Manufacturing Aircraft Company (Limited)</span> (1916) 32 TLR 253 at 255). However, as subsequently noted in <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 763 (“<span class="font-italic">Perennial</span>”) at [40], this broad phraseology does not give the court <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> and it is a jurisdiction that has to be exercised with caution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 While it is recognised that the circumstances in which it is just and equitable to wind up a company are not closed and that the court can superimpose equitable considerations (<span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> at [41]), there are a few broad categories of cases which fall within this ground. For illustration, these can be broken down as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where the substratum of the company has been lost as the main objects for which the company was set up can no longer be achieved: <span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (CA)</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where there is a deadlock in the management of a company: <span class="font-italic">Seah Chee Wan and another v Connectus Group Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 228;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) where the company is in truth a quasi-partnership, and there has been a breakdown of trust and confidence between the two groups of shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Chong Kok Ming and another v Richinn Technology Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] SGHC 224;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) where the company’s business had been carried on in a fraudulent manner: <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) where there is a loss of confidence in the directors on account of their lack of probity in the conduct and management of the company affairs: <span class="font-italic">Foo Peow Yong Douglas v ERC Prime II Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 299;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) where a shareholder has been excluded from management in breach of an understanding by the other shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Iniaga Building Supplies (S) Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 416.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The judicial managers and Creditor have made the submission that HTLI should be wound up on the basis that there was a “loss of substratum” as HTLI was an investment holding company that has since sold off all its income-generating assets.

The objects clause in a memorandum of association of the company sets out the business that the company is authorised to carry on. If the memorandum has been drafted very widely to include as many objects as possible – as in the case of a shelf company that was formed with no particular object in mind to be used as a corporate vehicle later on – then little assistance is derived in ascertaining the substratum of the company from construing the memorandum alone (<span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (CA)</span> at [38]). Instead, the court will have to consider all the circumstances of the case to ascertain the main object of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (HC)</span>, it was unhelpful to determine the company’s substratum by construing the memorandum of association alone as it contained a long list of objects. Instead, after analysing the surrounding circumstances of the case, it was held that the company’s substratum was to run a restaurant business in a particular location (<span class="font-italic">Re Goodwealth (HC)</span> at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (CA)</span> at [39]). In arriving at this conclusion, the court took into account the fact that the original shareholders wanted a corporate vehicle to carry on the restaurant at that location after a lease of the premises was secured, and that one of the shareholders was a friend of the general manager of the landlords. Thus, the company’s substratum disappeared with the termination of the lease of the premises at that location as the shareholders only wanted the restaurant to be operated from that specific location and nowhere else.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the present case, HTLI’s constitution was drafted to include as many objects as possible and contained different objects ranging from chartering ships to constructing roads.

</div> Thus, it is clear that the substratum of HTLI was to function as an investment holding company in respect of the HTL Group’s business. That substratum fell away following the sale of the shares in the subsidiaries to Golden Hill on 7 September 2020 and the applicant became a shell company holding the proceeds of the Share Sale in HTLI’s bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 However, what is relevant to note is that the loss of substratum ground is ordinarily relied upon by disgruntled shareholders in a winding-up application (and not the judicial manager – as in the present case). The reason why this is so becomes clear when we examine the rationale underlying the rule. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span> at [65]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 … the guiding principle to bear in mind when assessing whether to wind up a company on the basis that it has lost its substratum is to consider whether there is unfairness in keeping the aggrieved shareholder (whatever her reason for becoming a member of the company) locked into a company which is no longer carrying out and/or can no longer carry out the business it set out to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, the phrase “loss of substratum” can be rather misleading as it is not merely the falling away of the substratum that renders it just and equitable for the company to be wound up, but rather, it is the unfairness in locking-in shareholders into a business that they did not agree to. The unfairness does not arise from the loss of substratum <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, but “from a majority using its legal powers to maintain the association in circumstances to which the minority can reasonably say it did not agree” (<span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1092 at 1101H–1102A). As noted in <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law </span>(Walter Woon gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2021, Issue 26) at para 603, unfairness is present when one set of shareholders insist on having the other shareholders diversify into a different business that they did not agree to as the commercial risk would have changed. Those other shareholders should not have their capital locked in and should be entitled to pull out of the enterprise. Contrariwise, if the shareholders are not opposed to venturing into a different business, then there would be no unfairness. There would also be no unfairness when considering a situation of a sole shareholder of the company intending to pivot its business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Further, the rationale underlying the rule becomes evident when we examine the cases cited in submissions. All of these cases involved shareholders who were opposed to each other on whether the business of the company should continue despite the failure of an object that the company was set out to do. None of them involved a situation concerning a sole shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The case of <span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (</span><span class="font-italic">HC)</span> involved a dispute between shareholders on whether the company running a restaurant at a specific location should be wound up. One of the shareholders objected to the winding-up application on the basis that the company could pursue running a restaurant at a different location. It was held that it was better for the shareholders to part ways and for the company to be wound up: “where the company’s substratum has disappeared, and there is opposition by one of the two shareholder groups to continuing in business with the other, it is clearly ‘just and equitable’ that the company be wound up, so that the cash assets can be distributed and each of the two groups can go his own way” (<span class="font-italic">Goodwealth Trading (HC)</span> at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In <span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span>, the executrix of the deceased shareholder applied to wind up two companies on the ground that there was a loss of substratum, but this was opposed by the other shareholders of the company (at [18]). Once more, this was a situation where shareholders had opposing views on whether the business venture should come to an end. The court also considered whether the unfairness of the aggrieved shareholder being locked into a company that had lost its substratum could be negated by utilising the appropriate exit mechanism in the company’s articles of association (at [76]–[78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Turning to foreign authorities, the judicial managers cite the case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Perfectair Holdings Ltd</span> [1990] BCLC 423 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Perfectair</span>”).

</div> In that case, the company was set up as a holding company which held property and its business was carried on through a wholly-owned subsidiary which traded the property. An agreement was reached between shareholders that the assets, in the form of shares in the subsidiary, would be sold off. After the sale process, the only assets remaining in the holding company consisted of cash. A winding-up petition was brought by one group of shareholders, but this was opposed by another group of shareholders. Thus, this case also involved shareholders who were opposed to one another on the future plans for the company after it lost its substratum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Creditor raises the case of <span class="font-italic">Delco</span>, an Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal decision, where the investment holding company was ordered to be wound up as there was a loss of substratum after the underlying assets of the company, in the form of shares, were sold. However, again, the case is of little assistance because of the fact pattern – it involved a contest between two groups of shareholders over whether the company should be kept as a going concern after the sale (see [8]–[10]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In contradistinction to the abovementioned cases, the present case involves a sole shareholder (Ideal Homes) that is willing to continue operating HTLI as a going concern and it is the judicial managers who are petitioning for winding up. There is no unfairness to any shareholder in this case as Ideal Homes voluntarily agrees to take on the commercial risk to diversify HTLI’s business into other pastures. There is no issue of shareholders being locked into a different venture from what was envisaged and no unfairness ensues. As the notion of unfairness lies at the heart of the “just and equitable” jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827 at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> at [40]), in the absence of unfairness, winding up would not be appropriate. It bears reiterating that it is important to have regard to the rationale underlying the rule (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Company Law (Volume 6)</span> (LexisNexis Singapore, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> <span class="font-italic">Company Law</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 70.506): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">.. The commercial justification for this rule is straightforward: a businessman who puts his money into a particular business does his financial calculations on the basis of that business. It would be unfair if his money is used by the others in the company for some of the business that he has not agreed to and which may involve totally different risks and returns. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This principle has no application where the sole shareholder voluntarily accepts taking on a different business, even though HTLI would no longer be operating as an investment holding company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As pointed out by the Shareholders in oral submissions, the cases cited by the judicial managers and Creditor involved an underlying tussle between shareholders, which is unlike the present case where the sole shareholder desires to continue running the company.

However, “the notion of ‘unfairness’, though broad, does not give the Court a licence for capriciousness, and its powers should be exercised with caution” (<span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai v The Kheng Chiu Tin Hou Kong and Burial Ground</span> [2022] SGHC 36 (“<span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai</span>”) at [13]). While I do think that the necessary safeguards should be implemented, as explained below at [73]–[77], it would not be appropriate for HTLI to be compulsorily wound up by the court where it has been rehabilitated to solvency and the shareholder intends for the company to continue operating as a going concern.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Further, a company will not be wound up on the “just and equitable” ground simply on the basis that a prominent purpose for the company is incapable of being achieved if other objects of the company are still capable of being achieved (<span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai</span> at [43]).

</div> In the circumstances, the wishes of the shareholder in continuing to run the company as a going concern should be given weight and compulsory winding up would not be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 At this juncture, it is apposite to reference the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo Peow Yong Douglas v ERC Prime II Pte Ltd and another appeal and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1337 (“<span class="font-italic">Douglas Foo</span>”). The relevant company in question, ERC Prime II Pte Ltd (“ERCP II”), was an investment holding company and its principal business was to acquire and develop a hotel project (at [5]). ERCP II had no business of its own. Subsequently, the hotel property was sold with most of the investment returns being distributed. It was thus argued that ERCP II had lost its substratum and should be wound up on just and equitable grounds. However, the Court of Appeal rejected this argument and made the following observation (at [63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 … The loss of substratum ground is usually invoked where the company’s original purpose is <span class="font-italic">frustrated or no longer practicable</span>. In a situation where the substratum has been <span class="font-italic">fulfilled</span>, it appears to us, at least provisionally, that the better course is for the company to be wound up voluntarily rather than compulsorily by order of court. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Some parallels can be drawn to the present case. One could characterise the situation at hand as one where HTLI has fulfilled its substratum rather than it being frustrated. An investment holding company is set up to hold investments such as properties or shares and generates income from its underlying assets. However, it could also choose to realise those assets in future and distribute returns to shareholders, bringing the venture to an end. Here, the underlying assets have been sold via the Share Sale and the substratum of the company has been fulfilled. In the circumstances, a voluntary winding up initiated by Ideal Homes as the sole shareholder would be more appropriate than compulsory winding up by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The risk of the Shareholders trying to unwind the Share Sale to Golden Hill Capital is a separate matter which can be more appropriately addressed by other means. This background should not be conflated with the company law rationale in winding up a company.

</div> This ground is rarely utilised in Singapore. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> <span class="font-italic">Company Law</span> at para 70.506: “This ground seems to be little used nowadays. It is easier (and cheaper) just to let the company slide into dormancy. After several years of suspended animation, the Registrar of Companies may be induced to strike the company off as a defunct company.” The position appears to be the same in England, where it is said that a “company is seldom wound up on the basis that it has suspended its business” (Edward Bailey and Hugo Groves, <span class="font-italic">Bailey and Groves: Corporate Insolvency </span><span class="font-italic">– Law and Practice</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2021) at p 17). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 To my knowledge, <span class="font-italic">Lau Yu Man v Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd</span> [2007] SGHC 96 is the only published decision in Singapore which dealt with the suspension of business ground for winding up, but the case did not fully flesh out the intricacies of this ground. It seems that there are only a handful of English authorities of former vintage that could help illuminate the relevant principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Re Middlesborough Assembly Rooms Co</span> (1879) 14 Ch D 104 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Middlesborough</span>”), the company was incorporated with the aim of erecting some assembly rooms. Due to a trade depression, the company did not engage in construction work for three years. A member sought a winding-up order relying on the predecessor English Insolvency Act’s equivalent of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, but a large majority of shareholders opposed the petition. The order was not granted as the court said that it was not certain that the company had absolutely no intention of carrying on the business and the majority of shareholders wished to go on (at 111): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is true that there is no evidence that the company will proceed with their building within any given time, but I cannot look upon the delay as arising from anything but a wish to wait for a time when the business can be carried on more profitably than at present. Under these circumstances, I think that a winding-up order ought not to be directed when a vast majority of the shareholders wish to go on, and the only result of a compulsory winding-up would be a great and unnecessary expense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, the court will generally defer to the wishes of the majority shareholders even if the company has laid dormant for a period of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 To establish this ground, the court will enquire whether the business has been abandoned in its entirety, either wilfully or simply due to the inability to carry on trading for other reasons (see <span class="font-italic">Re Madrid and Valencia R</span><span class="font-italic">ailway Co</span> (1850) 19 LJ Ch 260). Consequently, there is no suspension of business when the cessation of business activities can be satisfactorily explained on other grounds, such as, for example, that the company does very little business in the winter months (<span class="font-italic">Re Tomlin Patent Horse Shoe Co Ltd</span> (1886) 55 LT 314), or that trade in the area of operation is depressed and the directors are waiting for better times (<span class="font-italic">Re Middlesborough</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 From the abovementioned, a common thread running through the cases is that the petition will generally be dismissed if the majority of shareholders are opposed to winding up and the company’s inactivity can be explained (<span class="font-italic">Re Metropolitan R</span><span class="font-italic">ailway Warehousing Co</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd </span>(1867) 36 LJ Ch 227). This ground for winding up is designed primarily to provide shareholders with a means of recovering their investment from a company which fails to engage in its intended business (<span class="font-italic">McPherson &amp; Keay</span> at p 253).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Applying the principles above to the present facts, it is not disputed that HTLI has suspended its business for over a year, since the Share Sale was completed on 7 September 2020. HTLI no longer carries on any investment holding activities and remains an empty shell with only cash assets. However, as mentioned above at [73], the commercial plans for HTLI had been submitted to the court in a sealed affidavit where the Shareholders expressed their intention to carry on business in HTLI in some form and are opposed to the winding up of the company. This alone would suffice to dispose of this ground. Further, the inactivity of HTLI can also be explained on the basis that it was placed in judicial management for the past few years (since 13 July 2020),

Looking at the chronology of events, there is some indication that they are attempting to reverse the Share Sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 After the Share Sale was completed on 7 September 2020, Yihua and Ideal Homes filed an application challenging the judicial managers’ decision to proceed with the Share Sale to Golden Hill under s 227R of the Companies Act in HC/SUM 3963/2020 on 14 September 2020. An order was sought to set aside the sale to Golden Hill and to direct the judicial managers to accept an offer from Man Wah instead (the preferred buyer of the Shareholders). I gave my decision in <span class="font-italic">HTL International (HC)</span> on 24 November 2020 and held that the judicial managers’ decision to prefer a sale to Golden Hill instead of Man Wah was in the interests of the creditors and shareholders as a whole and that fair consideration was given to both offers (at [47] and [83]). The Share Sale was not set aside. Yihua and Ideal Homes then appealed the decision, but the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 8 September 2020 in an <span class="font-italic">ex tempore </span>judgment as the Shareholders failed to show that the judicial managers had erred in concluding that Golden Hill’s offer would yield higher shareholder returns than Man Wah’s offer (<span class="font-italic">HTL International (CA)</span> at [20]–[24]). Clearly, what can be observed was that the Shareholders were discontented with the Share Sale to Golden Hill and wanted to unwind it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In parallel with these Singapore proceedings, the PRC Suits were commenced to hedge against any decision made by the judicial managers with regard to the Share Sale. On 28 May 2020, the then interim-judicial managers of HTLI (later appointed as the judicial managers) had already executed a sale and purchase agreement to sell the shares in the subsidiaries of the HTL Group to Golden Hill.

</div> There is some evidence that this might occur.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, a proposal was made by the judicial managers to resolve matters between all parties by giving effect to the claims made by Yihua in the PRC Suits whilst allaying the concerns that the Share Sale would be undermined. Part of the proposal envisaged the settlement of the PRC proceedings and provided that HTLI would pay the sum of RMB99,480,100 plus costs to Yihua (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>. the exact sum which Yihua is seeking) in full and final settlement of any claims which Yihua may have against HTLI. In exchange, Yihua will do the necessary to discontinue or withdraw the PRC Suits together with the freezing order and HTLI will be returned to the Shareholders.

</div> That would have resolved the entire matter. However, this proposal was rejected by Yihua on the basis that liability should be apportioned by the PRC court and HTLI should not bear the entire liability as Mr Phua YT and Mr Phua YP were also defendants in PRC Suit 534.

Only cryptic and non-committal responses have been given: “In the scenario raised by Mr Phua YT at [19(d)] of [his] Affidavit [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Yihua procuring HTLI to concede to the claim in PRC Suit 635], the Company is also likely to face repercussions if it admits to the claim brought in PRC Suit 635.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Looking at the entire circumstances, the inference is that the Shareholders are trying to frustrate the corporate rescue by the judicial managers. As the judicial managers have chosen to sell HTLI’s assets to a party which Yihua and Ideal Homes did not support (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Golden Hill instead of Man Wah), it appears that the PRC proceedings were pursued rigorously to undermine this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 There is a logical sequence of events. The Shareholders had invoked the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts to challenge the judicial managers’ decision to sell the assets in the subsidiaries to Golden Hill and tried to unwind the Share Sale, but had failed to do so. Yihua also sought to invoke the jurisdiction of the PRC courts in parallel to mount a collateral attack on the Share Sale and had already obtained a freezing order against some of the PRC subsidiaries. While I would not go so far as to suggest that the Shareholders would definitely cause HTLI to consent to the claims in the PRC Suits (should HTLI be returned to them instead of being wound up), there is to my mind, a real risk of this happening.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Hence, some protection of the corporate restructuring should be effected so that the work done by the judicial managers in rehabilitating the company is not undermined and there is no invalidation of the Share Sale. I turn now to determine the appropriate order in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Protection of the restructuring</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Winding up HTLI would not be appropriate here. In the present case, even if the statutory grounds for winding up are made out (contrary to the analysis above at [55]–[83]), I would be loath to compulsorily wind up a company that had been rehabilitated to solvency, albeit not trading, and where the sole shareholder wanted to continue business in some form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Even where the statutory grounds have technically been established, the court retains the residual discretion to consider whether, having regard to all relevant factors including the utility and effect of the winding-up order and the overall fairness, the company concerned should be wound up (<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Lau Yu Man</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 348 at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> at [82]; <span class="font-italic">Douglas Foo</span> at [59]). This stems from the language of s 125(1) of the IRDA as the “use of the word ‘may’ instead of ‘shall’ indicates a discretionary power in the court to order a winding up” (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [5]). This discretion had been exercised in <span class="font-italic">Seah</span><span class="font-italic"> Chee Wan v Connectus Group Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 228 at [111], where it was held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there was an ongoing business and the company was taking steps to remedy its cashflow issues (despite being found unable to pay its debts which had fallen due to a creditor).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Instead of winding up, the real complaint in the present case is the need to protect the restructuring so that it is not nullified. There are substantial consequences on the restructuring regime if that protection is not given. Credibility in the restructuring would be lost and Golden Hill would suffer prejudice as the white knight investor. Where the judicial managers have implemented the aims of judicial management, those aims should not be compromised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The judicial managers have already spent significant time trying to rehabilitate HTLI to solvency and carefully assessed the competing offers by Golden Hill and Man Wah in conducting the Share Sale. Allowing the Shareholders to undermine the Share Sale will undo all of the work done thus far, resulting in further protraction of matters between the parties even after the discharge of judicial management. There would be a substantial waste of time and resources. The proper arrangements must be put in place to ensure that what the judicial managers have done to achieve the objectives of judicial management for HTLI is not rendered nugatory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Confidence in the court process will also be eroded. Having failed in their attempts to set aside the Share Sale twice in <span class="font-italic">HTL International (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">HTL International (CA)</span>, the Shareholders should not be allowed to undermine the Singapore court processes which they themselves had invoked by pushing forward in the PRC Suits. That would be a backdoor attempt at obtaining what the Shareholders had failed to accomplish in the Singapore proceedings and getting an illegitimate second bite of the cherry. Moreover, it would amount to a collateral attack on the judgments rendered in Singapore which, in effect, approved the Share Sale to Golden Hill.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 One possible response that comes to mind is an injunction of some sort against the Shareholders to prevent them from pursuing anywhere any action or causing anything to happen that would unwind the corporate rescue. This does not offend the demands of the winding-up regime and most directly serves the identified interest at risk, namely, the protection of the rescue. However, the judicial managers have not argued on this basis, nor have the Shareholders had the opportunity to respond to any such application. It may be that the requirements for an injunction cannot be made out on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Nonetheless, as I have assessed that there is a real risk of the rescue being negated, and the objective of the judicial management being undermined, what I am able to do at the moment is to extend the judicial management by six months or other order of court, to allow the judicial manager to consider what appropriate application may be made to protect that rescue, with the judicial managers and the advisors continuing to be entitled to such compensation out of the company for their work. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I had previously granted an extension of the judicial management order (HC/ORC 3852/2020) until the present winding-up application is finally determined.
