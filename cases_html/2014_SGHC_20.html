<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
case raises issues relating to expert determination and breach of contract
which arise out of a settlement agreement made between the parties
on 12 March 2012 (“the Settlement Agreement”) pursuant to a dispute
over renovations works for a property at Sentosa Cove owned by the
Plaintiff (“the Property”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
First Defendant is an architecture and engineering firm, whereas the
Second Defendant is a building contractor (collectively, “the Defendants”).
Mr Koh Kok Peng (“Koh”) is a professional engineer and the principal
partner in the First Defendant; Koh also runs the Second Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On
or about 8 April 2010, the Plaintiff engaged the Defendants to carry
out additions and alterations (“the A&amp;A Works”) to the Property.
The First Defendant provided consulting engineer services for the
A&amp;A Works whereas the Second Defendant carried out the A&amp;A
Works. A quotation issued on 21 June 2010 (“the 21 June Quotation”)
stated the contract price for the A&amp;A Works as $367,800.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Subsequent
amendments to the scope of works in the 21 June Quotation were made
in a revised quotation attached to a letter from the Second Defendant
to the Plaintiff dated 20 August 2010 (“the Revised 21 June Quotation”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The
contract price, however, remained unchanged and it is not disputed
that the Plaintiff has made full payment of the contract price for
the A&amp;A Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       A
dispute arose between the parties regarding the A&amp;A Works. The Plaintiff,
alleging that the A&amp;A Works were defective and incomplete, commissioned
two companies to prepare reports on the A&amp;A Works. The first
report dated May 2011 was done by Building Appraisal Pte Ltd (“Building
Appraisal”) and described defects in the A&amp;A Works (“the Building
Appraisal Report”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The second report dated January
2012 was done by Lee Consultants and identified the discrepancies
between the actual “as-built” work on site and the approved plans
for the A&amp;A Works (“the Lee Consultants Report”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> For
ease of reference, I will refer to the Building Appraisal Report
and the Lee Consultants Report collectively as “the Consultants’
Reports”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On
8 February 2012, the Plaintiff through his solicitors issued a letter of
demand to the First Defendant, claiming a sum of $111,330 as <em>inter alia</em> compensation for defective
works done to the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> On the same date, the Plaintiff’s
solicitors wrote to the Professional Engineers Board (“PEB”), making
a complaint against the First Defendant and Koh and requesting the
PEB to investigate the matter and take necessary action against
Koh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It appears that the Plaintiff
also wrote to the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) on
20 February 2012 making a complaint against Koh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
dispute was resolved through mediation on 12 March 2012 and the
Settlement Agreement was entered into between the Plaintiff and
the Defendants. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, a professional
engineer was to be appointed to set out the scope and specifications
of works required to rectify the defects (“the Rectification Works”),
prepare and call for a tender for the said works, and evaluate the
tenders and award the contract. The scope and specifications of
the Rectification Works were to be “based on” the Consultants’ Reports
and were to be set out “on the basis of the most efficient manner
to rectify the defects so as to ensure that the works comply with
the required statutory regulations and are of a standard commensurate
with the price paid by the [Plaintiff] for the original works”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Under
the Settlement Agreement, the Defendants were to pay:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
fees of the professional engineer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
costs of the Rectification Works;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
costs of 2 “Somerset” service apartments of 3 bedrooms each (or
equivalent) and the costs of storage of the Plaintiff’s chattels
for the duration of the Rectification Works; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     $20,000
to the Plaintiff as compensation for moving and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the Plaintiff, he was to refrain from filing any complaints (presumably
against Koh or the Defendants) with the PEB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Defendants duly paid the Plaintiff
$20,000 as compensation for moving and costs and Mr Chan Yaw Fai
(“Chan”) was appointed as the professional engineer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Chan
quoted a lump sum of $88,000 for his fees, which was to be paid progressively
in instalments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Chan’s appointment on these terms
was confirmed in a letter from the Plaintiff’s solicitors dated
19 March 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Subsequently there was some discussion
between the parties regarding Chan’s fees, which the Defendants
felt were too high. Around the end of March 2012, the Defendants’
solicitor at that time, Mr Low Chai Chong (“Low”), wrote to the
Plaintiff’s solicitors stating that Chan’s quotation was far too
high and seeking the Plaintiff’s consent for Koh to contact Chan
to see if Chan could “give a discount” and also to clarify Chan’s
scope of works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff had no objections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
28 March 2012, Koh, together with Mr Freddie Chia (“Chia”), another
partner in the First Defendant, met with Chan to discuss his fees (“the
28 March 2012 Meeting”). There is some disagreement as to what transpired
at that meeting but what is not disputed is that after the meeting, Chan
agreed to give Koh what was in effect a discount of $8,000 on his fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants subsequently paid Chan $19,260, this sum being the first
instalment of his fees, and Chan returned $8,000 in cash to the Defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Chan
conducted site visits to the Property on 3 and 4 April 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He produced a set of tender
documents for the proposed Rectification Works (“the Tender Document”),
which he forwarded to the parties for their comments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> A
few amendments were made to the Tender Document pursuant to some
comments from the Plaintiff, to which the Defendants did not object.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> On
10 May 2012, Chan sent out invitations to tender to various contractors.
A site show-round of the Property (“the First Site Show-round”)
was conducted by Chan on 17 May 2012. The first tender was opened
on 31 May 2012 and four contractors submitted tenders based on the
Tender Document as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Winning
Flag Enterprise Pte Ltd (“Winning Flag”) at $188,800;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Builders
Alliance Pte Ltd (“Builders Alliance”) at $210,350;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Effulgent
Builder &amp; Marketing Pte Ltd (“Effulgent”) at $542,318; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     Crystallite
Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (“Crystallite”) at $623,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Initially,
Chan called for a tender interview with only the two higher bidders,
Effulgent and Crystallite. However, after objections from the Defendants,
all four tenderers were invited for a tender interview.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Three were
interviewed on 19 June 2012 whereas one (Builders Alliance) failed
to turn up for the tender interview. The three tenderers were then
asked to go for another site show-round on 21 June 2012 (“the Second
Site Show-round”). Either during the tender interview or the Second
Site Show-round, Chan handed a two-page questionnaire relating to
certain items in the Tender Document (“the Tender Questionnaire”)
to each contractor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
second tender was then opened on 26 June 2012. The revised bids were
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Winning
Flag at $498,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Effulgent
at $542,318;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Crystallite
at $566,200.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On
6 July 2012, Chan awarded the contract for the Rectification Works
to Crystallite for $498,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Defendants were dissatisfied
with Chan’s decision and did not make any further payment to the
Plaintiff under the Settlement Agreement. After unsuccessful further
mediation, the Plaintiff commenced the present suit on 16 August
2012. On the same date, the Plaintiff filed a complaint to the PEB
against Koh by way of a statutory declaration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> It
is not in dispute that the Rectification Works have never started.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
Plaintiff pleaded that he had suffered loss and damage as a result of
the Defendants’ breach of the Settlement Agreement and thus claimed the
following sums from the Defendants:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     $718,476.80,
made up as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       $74,900 being Chan’s outstanding fees (inclusive of goods and
services tax (“GST”));</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       $532,860 being the costs of the Rectification Works (inclusive
of GST);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       $96,000 being the rental already incurred for two Sentosa Cove
apartments for four months; <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       $14,716.80 being storage costs for four months;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rental
of $24,000 per month (being the average rental for two “Somerset”
service apartments) for four months being the duration of the Rectification
Works to be carried out;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Storage
costs of $3,679.20 per month from October 2012 until the completion
of the Rectification Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Defendants denied that the Plaintiff was entitled to any payment and
prayed for orders that Chan’s appointment as professional engineer under
the Settlement Agreement and the award of the contract to Crystallite
be set aside.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The
thrust of the Defendants’ argument on this point was that Chan was
not independent and was controlled by or acting under the influence
of the Plaintiff and/or his agents, and had also materially departed
from his instructions in awarding the tender to Crystallite. The
Defendants further prayed for a declaration that the Settlement
Agreement had been repudiated or terminated, alleging that the Plaintiff
had breached: (1) the fundamental term that he refrain from filing a
complaint to the PEB; and (2) the implied term that he (and/or his
agents) would not interfere with or exert any influence over the
professional engineer in the course of his work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Alternatively,
the Defendants’ case was that the Plaintiff (by himself and/or through
his agents) had conspired with Chan to <em>inter
alia</em> fix Chan’s fees at the unreasonable amount of $88,000,
increase the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works
beyond that prescribed in the Consultants’ Reports, and award the
contract to a higher bidder instead of to Winning Flag following
the first tender on 31 May 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
First Defendant therefore counterclaimed the sum of $35,260 from
the Plaintiff, comprising: $20,000 paid to the Plaintiff as compensation
for moving and costs under the Settlement Agreement; and $11,260
being the net amount paid to Chan for the first instalment of his fees.
The First Defendant also counterclaimed $4,000 being the outstanding professional
fees due in relation to additional works on the Property allegedly
carried out by the Defendants between July 2010 and April 2011 (“the
Additional Works”). The Second Defendant counterclaimed the sums of
$136,650 and $9,565.50 (being GST on the sum of $136,650) for the Additional
Works, as well as damages to be assessed in relation to the Plaintiff’s
complaint to the PEB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
parties agreed to bifurcation of the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Briefly,
the issues to be determined in this case are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
Chan’s appointment and the award to Crystallite should be set aside;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Which
party is in breach of the Settlement Agreement and what amount of
damages is due to that party;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether
the Plaintiff and Chan had conspired to injure or cause loss to
the Defendants; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether
the Defendants are entitled to their respective counterclaims against
the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It
is useful at the outset to introduce the witnesses and set out a
few observations on the reliability of their oral testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There
were five witnesses for the Plaintiff, comprising: (1) the Plaintiff;
(2) the Plaintiff’s wife, Madam Kok Lai Mooi (“Madam Kok”); the Plaintiff’s
two adult stepsons, (3) Dallan Cheah (“Dallan”) and (4) Dallon Cheah
(“Dallon”); and (5) Chan. At all material times, Madam Kok, Dallan, and
Dallon lived in the Property with the Plaintiff, although Dallan
and Dallon frequently travelled overseas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Plaintiff was generally unreliable as a witness and his testimony was
not very useful. He frequently testified that he was ignorant of
matters since he had left it to Madam Kok and his stepsons to deal
with Koh and the A&amp;A Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
since the rest of the evidence was consistent with the Plaintiff’s
testimony that he had little personal involvement in matters relating
to the A&amp;A Works or the Settlement Agreement, I found no need
to draw any adverse inference (as submitted by the Defendants) against
the Plaintiff as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I
found Madam Kok, Dallan, and Dallon to be generally forthright and
credible witnesses. The testimonies of Madam Kok and Dallan were particularly
relevant as they seemed to be the ones who were the most acquainted
with Koh, Chan, and the works to be done on the Property. I noted
however that Madam Kok occasionally had some difficulty recalling certain
events that had taken place, for example in relation to what she
had told or shown Chan during his site visits to the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As
for Chan, while I did not doubt his general honesty as a witness, his
testimony should be treated with circumspection since he appeared
to be rather confused and forgetful at times. For example, Chan
gave several different explanations of how he had arrived at his
professional fees of $88,000 but also candidly admitted that his
explanations were not consistent with his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
(“AEIC”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There
were six witnesses for the Defendants: (1) Koh; (2) Mr Abishek Murthy
(“Murthy”), the Defendants’ expert witness; (3) Mr Wee Yong Ping (“Wee”),
a project manager of Winning Flag; (4) Ms Sim Mui Ling (“Mui Ling”),
a director of the Second Defendant; (5) Low, the Defendants’ former solicitor;
and (6) Chia, a partner and director of the First Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Koh
was the key witness for the Defendants and was generally forthright
in his testimony. For instance, Koh admitted that the Second Defendant
was related to and managed by him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He
also readily admitted that the A&amp;A Works had been defective
and not up to standard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> However,
certain parts of his testimony were of doubtful credibility, in particular
his testimony relating to his suspicions about Chan’s partiality toward
the Plaintiff at various junctures, which was not consistent with
his surprisingly passive stance throughout the process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Murthy,
the Defendants’ expert witness, was a professional engineer. He
rendered an expert report on a number of matters relevant to the present
dispute, including whether the quantification of the Rectification Works
in the final tenders submitted by the tenderers took into account works
which exceeded the scope of the rectification works covered by the Consultants’
Reports and/or reflected the most efficient manner of rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Chan’s appointment and
the award to Crystallite should be set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The
first issue is whether Chan’s appointment under the Settlement Agreement
and/or the award to Crystallite should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Parties
rightly agreed that Chan’s appointment as the professional engineer
under the Settlement Agreement was a form of expert determination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Expert
determination as a mode of dispute resolution was explained by Chan
Seng Onn J in <em>The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd
v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 385
(“<em>Oriental Insurance</em>”) at [25] as
follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    Expert
determination – parties appoint their own expert to consider the
disputed issues and make a binding decision, without necessarily
having to conduct a full enquiry following the usual adjudicatory
rules, <em>eg</em>, rules of court in litigation,
formal arbitration rules and general rules of natural justice. The
role of the expert is to undertake an investigation of the facts
and to determine a dispute using his own expertise. His power and
jurisdiction is derived solely from the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
this case, it was clearly envisaged by the parties in the Settlement Agreement
that a professional engineer would be appointed as an expert to determine
the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works as well
as award the tender for the Rectification Works. The question, however,
is when one is entitled to set aside the appointment of the expert
or a decision of the expert. It should be noted that the setting
aside of an expert’s appointment is a distinct issue from the setting
aside of the expert’s decision or determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Setting aside of Chan’s appointment
as professional engineer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
foundation of expert determination is the law of contract. The starting
point for ascertaining the validity of an expert’s appointment is therefore
the contract itself. In this case, the Settlement Agreement provided
for the appointment of an expert as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Both
Parties shall endeavour to agree on the appointment of Lee Hon Leong
as Professional Engineer (the “<b>PE</b>”)
by 5pm on 13 March 2012.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">4.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Failing the agreement in paragraph
3 above, each party shall identify 3 Professional Engineers and
submit their names to the Mediator by 14 March 2012, who shall thereafter
appoint the PE from amongst the 6 named Professional Engineers who
are willing and able to act by 15 March 2012.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If none of the 6 named Professional
Engineers are willing and able to act then, despite the failure
of the Parties to agree to the appointment of Mr. Lee Hon Leong,
Mr. Lee Hon Leong shall be appointed to act as the PE.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     What
happened in this case was that since Mr Lee Hon Leong was not available
to act, the Plaintiff and the Defendants nominated six professional engineers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Out
of these six names, the mediator, Mr Chow Kok Fong (“the Mediator”),
chose to appoint Chan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I
do not see any reason for setting aside Chan’s appointment in this case.
The Defendants did not contend that Chan’s appointment was not in accordance
with the provisions of the Settlement Agreement. Nor did the Defendants
contend that Chan was in a position of conflict of interest in that
he had prior dealings with any interested party, as was the issue
in <em>HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore)
Ltd (trustee of Starhill Global Real Estate Investment Trust) v
Toshin Development Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 4 SLR 738
(“<em>HSBC v Toshin</em>”). Rather, the Defendants’
case was that Chan’s appointment should be set aside solely because
he acted in a biased manner and chose to align his interests with
those of the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> To
my mind, these concerns do not relate to the circumstances of Chan’s appointment.
They are more relevant to the issue of whether Chan acted properly
in making his determinations under the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Setting aside of Chan’s award
to Crystallite</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I
then consider the question of whether the Defendants are entitled
to an order that Chan’s award of the contract for the Rectification
Works to Crystallite should be set aside on the grounds that: (1)
Chan acted in bad faith or in a fraudulent or biased manner; or
(2) Chan had materially departed from the scope of his instructions
as set out in the Settlement Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As
a general rule, the only grounds for challenge of an expert’s determination
are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     material
departure from instructions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     manifest
error; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     fraud,
collusion, partiality and the like.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">See <em>Oriental Insurance</em> ([30] <em>supra</em>) at [47].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It
can thus be seen that the grounds for challenge of an expert’s determination
are narrow and the court will not interfere with the expert’s decision
save in situations where intervention is necessary to uphold the parties’
contractual bargain. As stated by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <em>Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering
Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 (“<em>Evergreat</em>”)
at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… An expert’s decision can be set aside
on the basis of fraud or partiality. Beyond that it is probably
correct to say that only a breach of an expert’s terms of appointment
would suffice to set aside his decision. Errors of fact or law will
not vitiate an award if the expert acts within his contractual mandate. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Material departure from instructions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I
will start by considering the latter of the two bases relied upon
by the Defendants to set aside Chan’s award of the contract to Crystallite.
On what constitutes a material departure from instructions, the
following passage by Dillon LJ in <em>Jones v Sherwood
Computer Services plc</em> [1992] 1 WLR 277 at 287 (cited
with approval in <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at
[48] and <em>Evergreat</em> at [40]) bears
repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On principle, the first step must be to
see what the parties have agreed to remit to the expert, this being,
as Lord Denning M.R. said in <em>Campbell v. Edwards</em> [1976]
1W.L.R 403, 407G, a matter of contract. The next step must be to
see what the nature of the mistake was, if there is evidence to
show that. <b>If the mistake made was that the
expert departed from his instructions in a material respect</b> —
e.g. if he valued the wrong number of shares, or valued shares in
the wrong company, or if, as in <em>Jones (M.)
v. Jones (R.R)</em> [1971] 1W.L.R 840, the expert had valued
machinery himself whereas his instructions were to employ an expert
valuer of his choice to do that — either party would be able to
say that the certificate was not binding because the expert had
not done what he was appointed to do. [emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The
first step is thus to ask: what did the parties agree to remit to Chan
under the Settlement Agreement? Clauses 6 to 10 of the Settlement Agreement
set out the duties of the professional engineer (“PE”) as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">6.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The
PE shall conduct a joint site visit by 16 March 2012 and by 19 March
2012 set out the scope and specifications of the rectification works
based on the 2 reports, namely the reports of Lee Consultants and
Building Appraisal Pte Ltd, on the basis of the most efficient manner
to rectify the defects so as to ensure that the works comply with
the required statutory regulations and are of a standard commensurate
with the price paid by the Claimants for the original works (the
“<b>Rectification Works</b>”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">7.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The scope and specifications of works

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">8.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Any disagreement on the PE’s scope
and specification for the Rectification Works shall be referred
back to Mr. Chow Kok Fong for an evaluation which shall be binding

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">9.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The PE shall take into account the

Works. The PE shall then proceed to call for tenders from at least
3 contractors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">10.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The PE will evaluate the tenders and
award the contract on the basis of the most reasonable quote received,
taking into account all the circumstances and not just price alone.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
excerpt above shows that the parties agreed to remit three major decisions
to Chan as the professional engineer under the Settlement Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     Determination
of the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works. This
was to be done based on the Consultants’ Reports and on the basis
of the most efficient manner to rectify the defects so as to ensure
that the works complied with the required statutory regulations
and were of a standard commensurate with the price paid by the Plaintiff
for the A&amp;A Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     Calling
for tenders for the Rectification Works from at least 3 contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     Evaluation
and award of the contract for the Rectification Works. This was
to be done on the basis of the most reasonable quote received, considering
all the circumstances and not just price alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Chan
was informed of his duties and the scope of his work through a letter
from the Plaintiff’s solicitors dated 16 March 2012 which was copied to
the Defendants’ solicitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The scope of his work described
in that letter was not the same as that stated in the Settlement
Agreement. This, however, is immaterial because Chan confirmed that
he was eventually furnished with a copy of the Settlement Agreement
after the 28 March 2012 Meeting with between himself, Chia and Koh
(see [10] <em>supra</em>) and before his
site visits to the Property on 3 and 4 April 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and
neither party contended that Chan was not bound to comply with the
relevant provisions of the Settlement Agreement pertaining to his
work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Having
established the instructions that were given to Chan under the Settlement
Agreement, the second step is to inquire into the nature of the mistake.
If the mistake made constitutes a material departure from instructions,
then the expert’s decision is not binding. As to the test of materiality,
any departure from instructions must generally be regarded as material
unless it can truly be characterised as trivial or <em>de
minimis</em> in the sense of it being obvious that it could
make no possible difference to either party; moreover, once a material
departure from instructions is established, the court is not concerned
with its effect on the result: <em>Veba Oil Supply
&amp; Trading GmbH v Petrotrade Inc</em> [2002] 1 All ER 703
at [26], cited with approval in <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at
[57]. Put another way, a departure from instructions must be considered
material unless the departure can be characterised as trivial or <em>de minimis</em> when analysed with respect
to the instructions and that end result, even if shown not to be
significantly different, must still be set aside as it is a nullity
and not binding: <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at
[84].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     A
distinction should be drawn between mistakes made by the expert and
a departure from instructions. In <em>Nikko Hotels
(UK) Ltd v MEPC plc</em> [1991] 2 EGLR 103 (“<em>Nikko
Hotels</em>”), Knox J expressed this distinction using the
analogy of answering the right or wrong question (at 108):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The result, in my judgment, is that if
parties agree to refer to the final and conclusive judgment of an
expert an issue which either consists of a question of construction
or necessarily involves the solution of a question of construction,
the expert’s decision will be final and conclusive and, therefore, not
open to review or treatment by the courts as a nullity on the ground
that the expert’s decision on construction was erroneous in law,
unless it can be shown that the expert has not performed the task
assigned to him. <b>If he has answered the right
question in the wrong way, his decision will be binding. If he has
answered the wrong question, his decision will be a nullity.</b> [emphasis
added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     
          <em>Nikko Hotels</em> was applied shortly thereafter
by Paul Baker QC in <em>Pontsarn Investments Ltd
v Kansallis-Osake-Pankki</em> [1992] 1 EGLR 148, where he
stated at 151:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The fact that he may be patently wrong
does not mean that he has not done what he was appointed to do nor
that he has asked himself the wrong question. To take any other
view would lead to the sort of refined arguments such as have been
deployed here and go a long way to emasculate the requirement that
the decision of the expert, as a matter of contract between the
parties, be final and binding. Thus, the advantages of cost, speed
and finality would be seriously diminished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, where the expert has not departed from his instructions
and has asked the right questions, his decision cannot be challenged
on the ground that he made a mistake, even if he subsequently admitted
the mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I
come now to the facts of the present case. The Defendants alleged that
Chan materially departed from his instructions in the following
ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chan
did not base the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works
solely on the Consultants’ Reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chan
expanded the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works
after the Tender Document was finalised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chan
did not ensure that the defects would be rectified according to
the most efficient manner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chan
failed to ensure that the standard of the Rectification Works was
commensurate with the price paid by the Plaintiff for the original
A&amp;A Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
first point to consider is whether Chan was entitled to go beyond the
scope of the Consultants’ Reports in preparing the scope and specifications
of the Rectification Works. The Plaintiff’s position was that Chan
was entitled to do so as clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement (see
[39] <em>supra</em>) did not contain the
terms “solely” or “only” and such terms should not be implied into
the Settlement Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants however contended that as a matter of contractual interpretation
(as opposed to the implication of terms), the parties’ objective
intention was that clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement should be
read as including the terms “solely” or “only”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The
Defendants’ main argument was that its interpretation of clause
6 of the Settlement Agreement was supported by the background facts leading
up to the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement, namely that the Plaintiff’s
claims at the mediation on 12 March 2012 were based solely on the
findings in the Consultants’ Reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants cited the following passage from <em>Zurich
Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”)
at [132]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The extrinsic evidence in question is admissible
so long as it is relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting
parties and relates to a clear or obvious context … However, the
principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention(s) remains
paramount. Thus, the extrinsic evidence must always go towards proof
of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed
upon. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
Plaintiff however pointed out that <em>Zurich Insurance</em> also cautioned
that extrinsic evidence should only be employed to illuminate the contractual
language and not as a pretext to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract
from the terms of a written contract, the applicable test being whether
the alternative interpretation falls within the scope of meaning
that the contractual words could bear (see <em>Zurich
Insurance</em> at [122]–[123], [132]). The Plaintiff thus
submitted that to ask the court to read the words “only” or “solely”
into clause 6 would be to effectively re-write the Settlement Agreement
and it was impermissible to rely on extrinsic evidence for such
purposes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
dispute here is primarily over the proper interpretation of the instructions
given to the professional engineer in the Settlement Agreement.
As such, there is a preliminary issue as to whether the court (instead
of the expert) has jurisdiction to decide such questions of interpretation:
see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Norwich
Union Life Assurance Society v P&amp;O Property Holdings Ltd</em> [1993]
1 EGLR 164; <em>Mercury Communications Ltd v Director
General of Telecommunications and another</em> [1996] 1 WLR
48. While this issue was not raised by the parties, I consider this
to be the applicable position in the present case in the absence
of any indication that the parties intended to remit such questions
to the professional engineer. In any case, the parties appeared
to have proceeded on the basis that questions of interpretation
should be decided by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In
my judgment, Chan’s instructions under the Settlement Agreement
did not restrict him to the scope of the Consultants’ Reports in preparing
the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works. The plain language
of the clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement merely provided that Chan
was to “set out the scope and specifications of the rectification
works based on” the Consultants’ Reports. Looking at the Settlement
Agreement in its entirety, it appears that the parties intended
to give the professional engineer a measure of discretion in preparing
the scope of the Rectification Works. For example, as pointed out
by the Plaintiff, clauses 7 and 8 of the Settlement Agreement provided
that parties could review the scope and specifications prepared
by the professional engineer and any disagreement would be referred
back to the Mediator for a binding evaluation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In
fairness to the Defendants, there is some merit in the point that
the Settlement Agreement was concluded in the context of the Plaintiff’s
letter of demand dated 8 February 2012 and the Plaintiff’s summary
of claim provided for the purposes of the mediation on 12 March
2012, both of which were based solely on the findings in the Consultants’
Reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> While the Consultants’ Reports
were obviously intended to be the main reference point for the professional
engineer in determining the scope of the Rectification Works, I
nevertheless find that clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement cannot
be given the restrictive interpretation that was suggested by the
Defendants, given the nature of the professional engineer’s role
in the Settlement Agreement. Koh himself conceded in cross-examination that
in certain circumstances, the professional engineer might be justified
in going beyond what was specified in the Consultants’ Reports:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>

</td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/>
<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, Low, the Defendants’ former solicitor,
stated his understanding of the professional engineer’s role under
the Settlement Agreement as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your
Honour, my recollection of the drafting of the settlement agreement
was just---it became clear, after meeting both sides, to Mr Chow
that it was not going to be possible to come to a settlement with a
final figure. … And along the line, er, there was a suggestion that, “Let’s
leave it to an independent party to assess the works based on the two
reports that have been submitted. And which form the basis of the claim
and the mediation”. So that proposal was agreed to in principle. … <b>[I]t was clear in my mind that the whole basis of
the settlement was to use those two reports, give it to a PE and
see what he comes up with</b>. … [emphasis added in bold]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Following
from the discussion above, I am of the opinion that Chan did not
materially depart from his instructions by including in the scope and
specifications for the Rectification Works other works which were
not stated in the Consultants’ Reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Similarly,
I am not satisfied that Chan materially departed from his instructions
by expanding the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works
after the Tender Document was finalised. The Defendants submitted
that Chan did so through the issuance of the Tender Questionnaire
to the tenderers and that this was impermissible under the Settlement
Agreement which did not envisage changes being made to the scope
and specifications of the Rectification Works once the Tender Document
was finalised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The
Plaintiff, on the other hand, submitted that the Tender Questionnaire
was part of the tender exercise that Chan was engaged to conduct
and was merely intended to clarify the scope of works covered by
the tenderers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> While
it is true that the Settlement Agreement did not expressly allow
for changes to be made to the Tender Document once it was finalised,
it also gave the professional engineer a measure of discretion and
autonomy in preparing the relevant documents and conducting the
tender process. In this context it cannot be said that Chan, by
issuing the Tender Questionnaire in the course of the tender process, had
not done what he was appointed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As
regards the Defendants’ last two points that Chan failed to ensure that
the defects would be rectified according to the most efficient manner and
that the standard of the Rectification Works was commensurate with the
price paid by the Plaintiff for the original A&amp;A Works, these
arguments were essentially based on the expert opinion of Murthy,
the Defendants’ expert witness, that Chan’s method of rectification
and scope of works in the Tender Document was neither the most efficient
nor of a standard commensurate with the price of the A&amp;A Works.
The Defendants were essentially saying that Chan had answered the
right question in the wrong way and not that he had answered the
wrong question. According to the authorities cited above, while
this may constitute an error on the part of the expert, it does
not constitute a departure from instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I
should add that these conclusions do not, however, detract from
the established principle that Chan, as a professional and as an
expert, owes duties of reasonable skill and care to both parties
and will be liable in damages should he be negligent in carrying
out his duties: see <em>Campbell v Edwards</em> [1976]
1 WLR 403 (“<em>Campbell v Edwards</em>”)
at 407. This is the safeguard which the law gives to parties when
they appoint an expert: <em>Holland House Property
Investments Limited v Crabbe</em> [2008] CSIH 40 at [6]. But
this is a separate issue from that of setting aside his expert determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fraud, collusion, and partiality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I
turn then to the other basis on which the Defendants challenged Chan’s
award, namely that he acted in bad faith or in a fraudulent or biased manner.
Many authorities have made general statements to the effect that an
expert’s determination will not be binding in the event of fraud, collusion,
partiality, and so on. A classic example is Lord Denning MR’s speech
in <em>Campbell v Edwards</em> (see [55] <em>supra</em>) at 407: “If there were fraud or
collusion, of course, it would be very different. Fraud or collusion unravels
everything.” In <em>Baber v Kenwood Manufacturing
Co Ltd and Whinney Murray &amp; Co</em> [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
175, Lawton J said at 181: “What is not acceptable is the risk of
the expert being dishonest or corrupt.” These last two statements
were reviewed in <em>Evergreat</em>, where
Rajah J opined at [29] that: “In the absence of fraud or any corrupt
colouring of the [expert’s] determination, there is neither liberty
nor latitude to interfere with or rewrite the parties’ solemn and
considered contractual bargain”. Perhaps the most comprehensive
description of this category of vitiating factors was given in <em>Oriental Insurance</em> where Chan J referred
at [47] to: “fraud, corruption, collusion, dishonesty, bad faith,
bias or the like”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In
this case, the parties were in agreement that Chan had the duty
to act as an independent and impartial expert under the Settlement Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants however submitted that the Plaintiff had influenced or
interfered with Chan’s work under the Settlement Agreement and/or
that Chan was biased and partial towards the Plaintiff throughout the
tender process, such that Chan and the Plaintiff were colluding
to obtain the best possible outcome for the Plaintiff to the Defendants’ detriment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants highlighted the following factors:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chan
had inflated his fees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chan

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chan

of the Plaintiff and/or his representatives;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_e"></a>(e)     Chan
advocated the Plaintiff’s interpretation of the Settlement Agreement

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_g"></a>(g)     Chan
unfairly disfavoured Winning Flag and Builders Alliance just because

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Since
one of the grounds of challenge raised by the Defendants is that of
bias and partiality, I should say a few words about the applicable
test for partiality in the context of an expert determination. In
England, the test is one of actual bias and not apparent bias: see <em>Macro and others v Thompson and others (No. 3)</em> [1997]
2 BCLC 36 (“<em>Macro v Thompson</em>”) at
65; <em>Bernhard Schulte GmbH &amp; Co KG v Nile
Holdings Ltd</em> [2004] EWHC 977 (Comm) at [98]; John Kendall,
Clive Freedman &amp; James Farrell, <em>Expert
Determination</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Expert Determination</em>”) at para 14.11.4. The
rationale for this rule was articulated by Robert Walker J in <em>Macro v Thompson</em> at 65 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]hen the court is considering a decision
reached by an expert valuer who is not an arbitrator performing
a quasi-judicial function, <b>it is actual partiality,
rather than the appearance of partiality that is the crucial test.</b> Otherwise
auditors (like architects and actuaries) who have a long standing professional
relationship with one party (or persons associated with one party)
to a contract might be unduly inhibited in continuing to discharge their
professional duty to their client, by too high an insistence on
avoiding even an impression of partiality. … [emphasis added in
bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In
Singapore, however, it appears that this point is not yet settled.
In <em>HSBC v Toshin</em> (see [34] <em>supra</em>), which concerned allegations of
bias against licensed valuers appointed pursuant to the lease agreement
between the landlord appellant and the tenant respondent, the respondent
argued before the Court of Appeal that at law, actual bias (and
not apparent bias) was required to challenge an expert’s appointment
(at [28]). The Court of Appeal did not express a final view on this
question as it decided that the issue of bias (whether actual or
apparent) did not even arise in that case (<em>HSBC
v Toshin</em> at [58]). It is similarly not necessary for
me to decide this question since the parties did not raise it and
in any event, the Defendants seemed to have proceeded on the basis
of actual bias rather than apparent bias. This issue therefore remains
to be decided in a future case with the benefit of submissions from
counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I
now come to the Defendants’ allegations of bias and collusion against
Chan. Dealing first with the alleged inflation of Chan’s fees, the Defendants’
position was essentially that Chan’s fees had been controlled by the
Plaintiff. It was suggested that Chan seemed to have no idea as
to how his fees were computed and that he had given a quote for
his fees at $88,000 even before he had reviewed the Consultants’
Reports or inspected the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> More
significantly, the Defendants alleged that at the 28 March 2012
Meeting between Koh, Chia and Chan (see [10] <em>supra</em>),
Chan had admitted or agreed that: (1) he did not quote a fee of
$88,000; (2) he had no control over his fees; (3) his fees were
usually only between $15,000 and $18,000; and (4) the Plaintiff
was out to “destroy” Koh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Having
considered the evidence before me, I was not persuaded that Chan’s
fees had been controlled by the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s version
of what transpired at the 28 March 2012 Meeting was supported by
purely oral accounts from Koh and Chia which, on a closer examination,
did not unequivocally point to the Plaintiff being in control of
Chan’s fees. For instance, both Koh and Chia stated that Chan did
not say who had control over his fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> Chia
also clarified that Chan did not specifically say that the Plaintiff
told Chan that he was out to destroy Koh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> I have
also taken into account the fact that Koh’s credibility as a witness
was uneven (see [27] <em>supra</em>). As
for Chia, his recollection of events has to be treated with some circumspection.
He appeared to be unable to recall anything about the meeting other
than the conversation he recounted in his affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> (which would
have taken only a few minutes) even though this meeting, according to
him, lasted 45 minutes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>.
Further, Koh and Chia’s accounts were disputed by Chan, who denied
that he had told Koh and Chia that the figure of $88,000 was not
his or that the Plaintiff was out to destroy Koh; Chan also said
that there had been no mention during the meeting of his usual fees
being between $15,000 and $18,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> As
for the basis of Chan’s fees, Chan did admit that his fees of $88,000
were not based on the Consultants’ Reports since he had only received
them <em>after</em> he first gave his quote
to the Plaintiff’s solicitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> As
highlighted by the Defendants, Chan also seemed unsure as to the
breakdown of his fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> However,
this is not sufficient to prove that the Plaintiff or his agents
had manipulated Chan in the setting of his fees. The burden of proof
that this had taken place lay with the Defendants and, in my judgment,
they have not discharged it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The
Defendants’ point that Chan considered the Plaintiff to be his client
and saw himself as the Plaintiff’s professional engineer is not,
in and of itself, sufficient proof of bias on his part. Chan’s role
as the professional engineer under the Settlement Agreement is similar
to that of a certifier under a construction contract whereby a contractor’s
entitlement to be paid is predicated on the issuance of a certificate
by the certifier. It is settled that the fact that a certifier under
a construction contract is appointed by the employer is an unavoidable
potential incidence of the contractual relationship and does not
disqualify him from making a decision under the contract: <em>Expert Determination</em> at para 14.11.2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
case of <em>Amec Civil Engineering Ltd v Secretary
of State for Transport</em> [2005] 1 WLR 2339 (“<em>Amec</em>”) provides a good illustration of
this. <em>Amec</em> concerned a dispute resolution
clause in a construction contract which provided that any dispute
or difference was to be referred to and settled by the engineer
whose decision was to be final and binding subject to arbitration
proceedings being brought within a certain time. One of the issues
before the court was whether the engineer’s decision under the contract
was vitiated for procedural unfairness because a parallel claim
was also being brought by the respondent against the engineer in
respect of the subject matter of his decision. The majority of the
Court of Appeal held that in the circumstances, the engineer had
considered the matter properly and sufficiently; the fact that an
equivalent claim was brought against the engineer did not disqualify
the engineer from giving a valid decision under the dispute resolution
clause since such a conflict of interest was an unavoidable potential
incidence of the contractual relationship between the parties: <em>Amec</em> at [52].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It
has been observed that a certifier or professional consultant in
a construction contract is often called upon to perform two different
types of duties: (1) in issuing certificates which determine the
contractor’s entitlement to be paid or deciding controversial matters
such as valuation, he must act fairly and exercise his own judgment
objectively; (2) in other matters, he is the agent of the owner
and must look after the interests of the owner in the project: see
Chow Kok Fong, <em>Law and Practice of Construction Contracts
Vol 1</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 4th Ed, 2012) at para
8.42; <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</em> (Nicholas
Dennys QC <em>et al</em> eds) (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2010) at para 4–037.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The
dual function of an architect in a building contract was noted by Lord
Reid in <em>Sutcliffe v Thackrah</em> [1974]
AC 727 (“<em>Sutcliffe</em>”) at 737:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It has often been said, I think rightly,
that the architect has two different types of function to perform. <b>In many matters he is bound to act on his client’s
instructions, whether he agrees with them or not; but in many other matters
requiring professional skill he must form and act on his own opinion.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Many matters may arise in the course of
the execution of a building contract where a decision has to be
made which will affect the amount of money which the contractor
gets. Under the R.I.B.A. contract many such decisions have to be
made by the architect and the parties agree to accept his decisions. For
example, he decides whether the contractor should be reimbursed
for loss under clause 11 (variation), clause 24 (disturbance) or
clause 34 (antiquities); whether he should be allowed extra time
(clause 23); or when work ought reasonably to have been completed
(clause 22). And, perhaps most important, he has to decide whether
work is defective. These decisions will be reflected in the amounts
contained in certificates issued by the architect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The building owner
and the contractor make their contract on the understanding that
in all such matters the architect will act in a fair and unbiased
manner</b> and it must therefore be implicit in the owner’s
contract with the architect that he shall not only exercise due
care and skill but also <b>reach such decisions
fairly, holding the balance between his client and the contractor.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In <em>Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development
Co (Pte) Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 458, the Court of Appeal
cited <em>Sutcliffe</em> with approval, making
the following observations (at [15]–[16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    It
is settled law that an architect under a building contract is not
an arbitrator. But he has a dual function. In the words of Lord
Reid in <em>Sutcliffe v Thackrah</em> [1974]
AC 727 at 737; [1974] 1 All ER 859 at 863:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In many matters he is bound to act on his
client’s instructions, whether he agrees with them or not; but in
many other matters requiring professional skill, he must form and
act on his own opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    It
is equally settled law that an owner and a contractor would have made
their contract on the understanding that in all matters where the architect
has to apply his professional skill and judgment, the architect
will act in a fair and unbiased manner in applying the terms of
the contract. Such matters will include the issue of certificates
for payments and the grant of extension of time. While an architect
under such a contract is the employer’s agent, in the exercise of
his functions requiring skill and judgment, he must act fairly and
professionally and neither party should seek to unfairly or unduly
influence him in the discharge of those functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I
regard the above authorities to be applicable to the present case. Chan
cannot be regarded as independent because he is employed by the Plaintiff.
Chan’s general function was to act on behalf of the Plaintiff, for example
in supervising the Rectification Works and liaising with the relevant
authorities to regularise all drawings, submissions and construction
works on site.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> (While these functions were set
out in the letter from the Plaintiff’s solicitors dated 16 March
2012 and not the Settlement Agreement itself, I note that the Settlement
Agreement did not prohibit Chan from undertaking such responsibilities
and in any event, the letter from the Plaintiff’s solicitors dated
16 March 2012 was copied to the Defendants’ solicitors at that time
and no objections to it were ever raised by the Defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>)
However, in those parts of Chan’s duties which allocated decision-making
functions to him, he was required to act professionally, honestly
and impartially in discharging those functions as opposed to favouring
the interests of the Plaintiff: see <em>Scheldebouw
BV v St. James Homes (Grosvenor Dock) Ltd</em> [2006] EWHC
89 (TCC) at [34]–[35].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Chan’s
decision-making functions under the Settlement Agreement included
setting out the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works, conducting
a tender for the Rectification Works and evaluating and awarding
the tender. The parties must have intended that Chan was to discharge
these functions in a fair and unbiased manner, without preferring the
interests of either the Plaintiff or the Defendants. Indeed, the
entire purpose of Chan’s appointment under the Settlement Agreement
was to provide a fair and neutral way of rectifying the defective
A&amp;A Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The
real question is therefore whether Chan acted impartially in drawing
up the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works and in his
conduct of the tender process, or whether he favoured the interest
of the Plaintiff in doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On
the evidence before me, I consider that Chan did favour the interest
of the Plaintiff in carrying out his duties under the Settlement Agreement
and accordingly failed to act impartially in that regard. I agree with
the Defendants that this was evident from the fact that: (1) Chan
was of the mentality that the Rectification Works had to be carried
out to the Plaintiff’s satisfaction; and (2) Chan had increased
the scope of the Rectification Works on the request of the Plaintiff
and/or his representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In
my judgment, Chan acted in the way he did due to the mistaken view
that he was to act as the Plaintiff’s agent in setting out the scope
and specifications of the Rectification Works and in conducting
the tender for the Rectification Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     That
Chan had misdirected himself is evident from his understanding that
the Rectification Works had to be carried in a manner which, in
effect, only took into account the interests of the Plaintiff and
did not take into account the Defendants’ interests. In his AEIC,
Chan repeatedly stated that as the professional engineer, he had
to ensure that the Rectification Works were carried out “to the
satisfaction of the Plaintiff”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Chan
further explained in his AEIC that it was with this understanding
that he had prepared the Tender Document “which provided a comprehensive
list of rectification works that [he] deemed were necessary”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Chan
also explained that the Tender Questionnaire which reminded the
contractors that their quotes should include the cost of full reinstatement
in the event that the replacement works could not match the existing
finishes was acceptable because it was the professional engineer’s
responsibility to “ensure that the Plaintiff is satisfied with the
end product”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Chan subsequently in
cross-examination retracted his statements somewhat by saying that
only some items had to be rectified to the Plaintiff’s satisfaction while
most of the other works had to be rectified to his own satisfaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
it was clear from his testimony that he had confused his general
function as the Plaintiff’s professional engineer with his special function
under the Settlement Agreement to act impartially and fairly in determining
the scope of the Rectification Works and awarding the contract on
the basis of the most reasonable quote received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Chan’s
mistaken view of his role under the Settlement Agreement was also
evident from the way that he allowed additional works to be included in
the Rectification Works to be paid for by the Defendants on the instruction
of the Plaintiff and/or his representatives. One example of this relates
to an abrupt drop in the floor level at the entrance to the karaoke room
on the third floor of the Property. Chan’s finalised Tender Document required
the contractor to “cut-down 50mm drop at entrance to [the karaoke
room]” and Chan testified that he had envisaged that this would involve
creating a ramp at the entrance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> However,
he did nothing when, during the Second Site Show-around, Madam Kok
asked the contractors to adopt what was a significantly costlier
remedy of removing the entire raised platform of the room.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> On
the stand, he accepted that these were additional rectification
works that had to be paid for separately by the Plaintiff but when
he was questioned as to how he envisaged this would be done, he
gave an unconvincing explanation that he would issue a variation order
to remove this item and reduce the awarded contract sum subsequently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> This
explanation was probably an afterthought given the complete absence
of any contemporaneous supporting documents and the fact that this
intended course of action was never referred to in either his lengthy
AEIC or the affidavits of any other witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The
last point of note relates to the Defendants’ submissions that Chan
unfairly disfavoured Winning Flag and Builders Alliance simply because
they were the tenderers nominated by the Defendants. It was not disputed
that Winning Flag and Builders Alliance were the Defendants’ nominated
contractors. Chan’s evidence was that he had found their quotations
too low to carry out the job properly and that, after a telephone conversation
with Koh, he had realised that Koh was behind their tenders since
he had recommended them as contractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> Chan took this as a factor against
their bids for the following reason:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So
the---the purpose of that is---is, he---he want to submit a---a
low tender so---because the money come out his pocket. So it will---he would
probably do it as cheap as possible again.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In
my judgment, if Chan’s testimony is correct, he cannot be faulted for
taking into account the fact that Winning Flag and Builders Alliance were
contractors nominated by Koh as a factor against them, especially since
Koh was clearly an interested party insofar as he was the one responsible
for paying for the Rectification Works. Nevertheless, while Chan
may be have been rightly suspicious of the competence and reliability of
Winning Flag and Builders Alliance, his evaluation of the tenderers
did not seem to have taken into account the interests of the Defendants
at all but were based on the Plaintiff’s interests as the building
owner. In fact, under cross-examination, Chan admitted that his
first evaluation report dated 8 June 2012 which evaluated the tenders
received from the first tender exercise was not objective<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> and contained
criticisms of Winning Flag and Builders Alliance that were not fair<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In
re-examination, Chan attempted to explain that he had not in fact understood
the meaning of “not objective” and that he had only agreed with counsel
for the Defendants, Mr Derek Kang (“Mr Kang”), that he was not objective
because “I’m a bit confused”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> However,
I found his claim of ignorance incredible. First, from what I observed
to be his command of the English language in the witness box, it
was highly unlikely that he did not understand the meaning of “not
objective”. Second, he had in fact answered other questions in the
course of his oral testimony confirming his duty to be “objective”
in preparing the Tender Document<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> and
in assessing the tenders<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>.
Third, at yet another point in his testimony, he had contrasted the
objectivity with which he evaluated the second round of tenders
with the lack of thereof in the first round:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Would
you agree with me that because of the way you had evaluated Winning
Flag for the second tender, you were also not fully objective for
the second tender?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I disagree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I put it to you that you were not fully
objective for the two tenders and you were unfair to some of the
contractors for the two tenders because you had allowed yourself
to be influenced by the plaintiff or his representatives.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I disagree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Are you able today to give us the explanation

you can tell us.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I was not objective in the---on the
first---first relation. In the second one, I think, er, I’m very

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I
was also not convinced by the somewhat strained distinction sought to
be made by counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Eric Chew (“Mr Chew”),
in re-examination (which Chan agreed with) that Chan had merely
been “agreeing with Mr Kang’s feeling that it’s not fair” and was
“not saying that [Chan] had not been fair”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Therefore,
having concluded that Chan failed to act impartially and fairly
as between the parties due to his own mistaken notion of his functions under
the Settlement Agreement, his award of the contract to Crystallite must
be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of the Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The
question then is what effect the setting aside of Chan’s award to Crystallite
has on the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The
usual consequence of a successful challenge to an expert’s determination
is that it is a nullity and does not bind any of the parties: <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at [84]. Usually, the
court will direct that the expert come to a new decision in accordance
with the instructions as clarified by the court: <em>Expert
Determination</em> at para 14.18.3. For example, in <em>Oriental Insurance</em>, the expert was found
to have materially departed from his instructions such that it amounted
to a manifest error. Chan J thus remitted the determination to the
expert for his re-consideration and provided the expert with a detailed
computation guide (<em>Oriental Insurance</em> at [223]–[225]).
However, the courts have also substituted alternative machinery
for the contractual machinery in appropriate cases. For example, in <em>Macro v Thompson</em> (see [58] <em>supra</em>) the court considered that a revaluation
by the expert auditor would be inappropriate given his lack of expertise
in the relevant area and directed that new valuations be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In
the present situation, the way forward is obstructed by the fact
that there are allegations on both sides that the other party is
in repudiatory breach of the Settlement Agreement. First, there
is the Defendants’ argument that they were entitled to terminate
the Settlement Agreement because the Plaintiff had breached an implied
term in the Settlement Agreement not to interfere with or influence
the professional engineer in his course of work. Second, there is
the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendants failed to comply with
the Settlement Agreement by refusing to pay for Chan’s fees and
the costs of the Rectification Works. Third, there is the Defendants’
argument that the Plaintiff breached a fundamental term of the Settlement
Agreement by filing a complaint to the PEB on 16 August 2012 (see
[14] <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Implied term not to interfere
with the expert’s independence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It
was not in dispute that there was an implied term in the Settlement Agreement
that the parties would not seek to interfere with the professional engineer’s
independence or influence the professional engineer in his course
of work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> The
dispute is over whether the Defendants have adduced sufficient evidence
of unlawful influence or interference by the Plaintiff in Chan’s
work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In
my judgment, there is insufficient evidence of such unlawful influence
or interference in this case. I have already found that there is
no evidence that the Plaintiff and/or his agents had controlled
Chan’s professional fees (see [61] <em>supra</em>).
I have also found at [71] above that any bias or partiality towards
the Plaintiff on the part of Chan was because he had misconstrued
his role under the Settlement Agreement and not because the Plaintiff
had acted improperly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The
only evidence of any “interference” with Chan’s work was that Madam
Kok had brought Chan around the Property during his site visits on
3 and 4 April 2012 to point out some defects which were not contained in
the Consultants’ Reports, and that she had made some requests for additional
rectification works to Chan and/or the potential contractors during
the First and Second Site Show-rounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> However, I do not regard the Settlement
Agreement as prohibiting any communication between the Plaintiff
and his family members and the professional engineer or would-be contractors
who came to inspect the Property which they were unfamiliar with
and which the Plaintiff and his family were living in. It would
have been reasonable to expect some communication to take place
on those occasions and if the parties intended to prohibit this,
the Settlement Agreement would have stated it explicitly. In this
regard, I note that Koh, on behalf of the Defendants, had himself
made a telephone call to Chan on either 6 or 7 June 2012 regarding
Chan’s evaluation of the tenders received from the first tender
exercise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> While
the contents of the telephone conversation were disputed, what was
not in dispute was the fact that there were communications between
Koh and Chan which were initiated by Koh and which did not involve
the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The
issue is therefore whether Madam Kok’s conduct in communicating
with Chan and/or the potential contractors went beyond what was
acceptable and amounted to an improper attempt to influence Chan
or interfere with his independence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     There
is nothing to suggest that Madam Kok knew that she was pointing
out defects to Chan which were not in the Consultants’ Reports or that
she was trying to get Chan to include in the Rectification Works additional
works that should not have been the Defendants’ responsibility. As
I have stated above at [24], Madam Kok was an honest and candid witness.
At that time, she was living in a house that had numerous defects
as a result of the Defendants’ failure to carry out the A&amp;A
Works properly. In those circumstances, it is understandable that
she would have been eager to point out all the defects to Chan during
his visits to the Property. Her primary goal was to get her house
fixed and knowing that Chan was supposed to be the professional,
she would not have been particular about whether or not a specific
defect was within the scope of the original A&amp;A Works and Consultants’
Reports. There is no evidence of any impropriety on her part or
that her actions, from an objective point of view, were the type
of actions which would have impaired Chan’s ability to independently determine
the issue in exercise of his professional judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As
for the communications made by Madam Kok during the First and Second
Site Show-rounds relating to certain things to be done on the Property,
Chan characterised these as “requests”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> and there is no evidence
that any of these “requests” were made in a manner which would have
impaired Chan’s professional judgment in assessing whether they should
be properly acceded to. More detailed testimony of these “requests” was
given by Wee, a project manager of Winning Flag and a witness for
the Defendants, but the reliability of his testimony is doubtful.
First, in Wee’s AEIC, it was unclear whether the requests came from
Dallan, Dallon, Madam Kok or Chan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Second, in Wee’s oral
testimony, he did not appear entirely sure about the attribution
of instructions to Madam Kok.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Third,
his recollection of almost everything which he said he was told
to do during either the First or Second Site Show-rounds or the
Tender Interview was, according to him, based upon “impressions”
he had which were unconfirmed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> Moreover,
in the one instance where he did go into some detail explaining
the basis of his “impression”, which was in relation to an alleged
instruction by either Dallan or Dallon to replace the glass panels
in the lift instead of re-using them, his explanation was quite
unconvincing:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er,
the actual wording by---I don’t remember the actual wording. Er, what
I was given was the impression that---because I---I, er, I cannot remember
the actual wordings said during the tender, the second tender showround.
But we were given the impression because they asked something like,
“You think you can---you think that, er, by---by shifting in, er,
you think that you can still reuse back or not?” That’s what they
say, something like that. The tonality is that, er, once it’s been
taken outright, it, er, cannot be reused back, what. That’s our impression.
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Similarly,
there was no or (for the reasons set out above) insufficient evidence
that the Plaintiff, Dallan or Dallon had made improper attempts
to influence Chan or interfere with his independence. Chan may have expanded
the scope and specifications of the Rectification Works beyond the
Consultants’ Reports or even after the Tender Document was finalised but
this in itself is not proof that the Plaintiff and/or his agents
acted in breach of the obligation under the Settlement Agreement
not to interfere with Chan’s independence. I should also reiterate
that my finding is not that Chan acted fraudulently or in collusion
with the Plaintiff and/or his agents, but that he acted on a mistaken
view as to his proper function under the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendants’ failure to pay and
Plaintiff’s complaint to the PEB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A
brief chronology of events is useful here. Chan awarded the contract
for the Rectification Works to Crystallite on 6 July 2012 and the letter
of award was copied to <em>inter alia</em> Low,
who was the Defendants’ solicitor at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> In
an e-mail dated 6 July 2012, Low wrote to Chan to inform him that
the Defendants had “serious reservations on the award of this contract,
and the events leading to the award” and to reserve the Defendants’
rights pending fuller instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff’s solicitor, Mr Chew,
replied via an e-mail dated 12 July 2012, asking for further details of
the Defendants’ “reservations” and informing Low that the Plaintiff would
not hesitate to commence legal action if the Property was not rectified
speedily.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> On the same date, Mr Chew sent a letter
on behalf of the Plaintiff to the Defendants demanding payment of
the contract sum for the Rectification Works, the balance of Chan’s
fees, as well as rental and storage expenses which the Plaintiff
had proceeded to incur (having informed the Defendants of these
expenses via an earlier letter but apparently receiving no response
from the Defendants).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> On 20 July 2012, Low wrote to
Mr Chew, setting out certain areas of concern and requesting mediation
pursuant to clause 14 of the Settlement Agreement, which stipulated
that any disputes arising from the agreement had to be referred first
to the Mediator for further mediation before any legal action was commenced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> There
was then some further discussion between the parties regarding the
further mediation, which eventually took place before the Mediator
on 6 August 2012. The further mediation session was unsuccessful.
On 16 August 2012, the Plaintiff commenced the present suit and
also filed a complaint to the PEB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The
issue is whether the Defendants were in repudiatory breach of the Settlement
Agreement by refusing to pay the balance of Chan’s fees and the costs
of the Rectification Works. In the light of my decision to set aside Chan’s
award of the contract to Crystallite on the grounds that Chan had not
acted impartially in the discharge of his responsibilities, this
claim cannot succeed. As regards the balance of Chan’s fees, this
was to be paid on or after his completion of Tender Document at
the earliest<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> and the preparation of that document
was tainted by his lack of impartiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I
then turn to consider the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff breached
a fundamental term of the Settlement Agreement by filing a complaint
to the PEB, contrary to his obligations under clause 12 of the Settlement
Agreement which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">12.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">This settlement agreement represents a full and final settlement
of all claims the [Plaintiff] has or may have against the [Defendants].
The [Plaintiff] <b>shall not file any complaints
with the Professional Engineers Board</b> and shall forthwith
inform the Building and Construction Authority that the matter has
been resolved and another Professional Engineer will be taking over
the conduct of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Much
was made by the Defendants of the importance to them of the Plaintiff
refraining from making such a complaint and the fact that all the parties
were aware of this before and during the negotiations leading to
the Settlement Agreement. The Defendants alleged that the Plaintiff
had, in fact, used the threat of a complaint to drive a hard bargain
during the negotiations. However, I do not need to make a determination
on whether the obligation not to complain to the PEB was a fundamental
term of the contract. This is because, in my judgment, clause 12
of the Settlement Agreement, insofar as it seeks to prohibit the
Plaintiff from making a complaint to the PEB, is illegal and unenforceable
because it allows a professional engineer to effectively contract
out of regulatory oversight of his professional conduct by the PEB
under the Professional Engineers Act (Cap 253, 1992 Rev Ed) (“the
Professional Engineers Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The
Defendants’ arguments on this point were fivefold.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> First,
they submitted that the Plaintiff had not pleaded that clause 12
of the Settlement Agreement was contrary to public policy. I am
not persuaded by this argument. The unenforceability of a particular
contractual term on public policy grounds cannot be dependent on
the pleadings of the parties. Public policy considerations are,
by their very nature, overriding factors which the court has to
take into account regardless of the positions which the parties may
take. As Lindley LJ stated in <em>Scott v Brown,
Doering, McNab &amp; Co</em> [1892] 2 QB 724 at 728: “It matters
not whether the defendant has pleaded the illegality or whether
he has not. If the evidence adduced by the plaintiff proves the
illegality the Court ought not to assist him.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The
second contention of the Defendants was that there was nothing in
the Professional Engineers Act or the relevant subsidiary legislation
that compelled any person to file a complaint to the PEB under any circumstances,
unlike in s 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev
Ed) (“CPC”) which imposed a duty to give information of certain offences.
An agreement not to make a report in relation to an offence set out
in s 424 of the CPC would thus be unenforceable because it would
be an agreement to resile from a legal duty or obligation. The Defendants
thus submitted that in the absence of any legal duty or obligation
to report any act or offence to the authorities, an agreement not
to report such an act or offence was enforceable. Third, the Defendants
argued that clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement was akin to a
compromise by a party not to commence legal proceedings against
another party in exchange for adequate compensation, which was valid
and enforceable. Fourth, the Defendants also likened the obligation
in clause 12 to an agreement not to volunteer to give evidence,
which was upheld in the English case of <em>Barrett v
Universal-Island Records Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [2006] EWHC 1009
(Ch) (“<em>Barrett</em>”). Finally, the Defendants
highlighted that public policy also required that contracts freely
entered into be upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I
address the second and last points raised by the Defendants first.
As I understand it, the Defendants’ argument on the second point
was essentially that because the Professional Engineers Act <em>allows</em> for complaints to be made to the
PEB but does not <em>compel</em> complaints
to be made, it would not be contrary to the said Act for parties
to contract out of their rights to complain against a professional
engineer to the PEB. The fallacy of this argument is clearly demonstrated
by the well-known case of <em>Johnson v Moreton</em> [1980]
AC 37 (“<em>Johnson v Moreton</em>”) where
the House of Lords held that a particular statutory provision in
relation to agricultural holdings gave a tenant an option to serve
a counter-notice in response to a notice to quit served on him by
his landlord and that the words and policy of that statute made
it clear that the tenant could not by agreement exclude his right
to serve a counter-notice under that statutory provision. Simply because
the Professional Engineers Act does not impose a duty on persons to
make complaints but allows for complaints to be made is thus not conclusive;
the essential inquiry is parliamentary intention and the purpose of
the statute. As for the Defendants’ last point on freedom of contract, while
this general principle cannot be denied, this is not the end of
the inquiry. Indeed, in <em>Johnson v Moreton</em>,
Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone noted the maxim that a person may
renounce a right which exists solely for his own use or benefit
but that the key to the interpretation of this maxim was in determining
“whether the particular liberty or right conferred by the statute
or rule of law is entirely for the benefit of the person purporting
to renounce it. If there is a public as well as a private interest
a contrary Latin maxim applies” (at 58).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As
regards the remaining submissions of the Defendants, these submissions
overlook the fact that the legislative intent of the Professional Engineers
Act is to make an engineer accountable for his professional conduct
not only to his client but also to a statutory body whose functions include
the maintenance of standards of professional conduct and ethics
of the engineering profession (see s 6(<em>d</em>)).
This reflects the wider public interest which is to prevent misconduct
on the part of those who hold themselves out to the public at large
as professional engineers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I
note that the Defendants have attempted to draw an analogy between
clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement and contracts not to commence
legal proceedings or not to give evidence which have been held to
be valid. The examples raised by the Defendants are instances of contracts
to stifle a prosecution or contracts that tend to oust the jurisdiction
of the courts, and the Defendants are right to point out that the prohibition
only applies to contracts which adversely affect the <em>public</em> interest; it does not affect a
contract in which the relevant offence or wrong is essentially a
matter of <em>private</em> interest. Hence
the distinction drawn between contracts stifling the prosecution
of compoundable offences (which are not opposed to public policy)
and contracts which pertain to non-compoundable offences (which
are illegal and against public policy): see <em>AJT
v AJU</em> [2011] 4 SLR 739 at [20]. The rationale for this
is that conduct which tends to undermine the wider public interest
should be left to the administration of the law and not to private
individuals. As Cotton LJ observed in the English Court of Appeal
decision of <em>Windhill Local Board of Health
v Vint</em> (1890) 45 Ch D 351 at 363:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he court will not allow as legal any
agreement which has the effect of withdrawing from the ordinary
course of justice a prosecution when it is for an act which is an
injury to the public. It would be the case of persons taking into
their own hands the determining what ought to be done; and that
ought not to be taken into the hands of any individuals … but ought
to be left to the due administration of the law, and to the Judges,
who can determine what in the particular case ought to be done.
I think it goes beyond saying, that in the particular case there
can be or cannot be any evil to the public; but you are taking the
administration of the law, and the object which the law has in view, out
of the hands of the judge and putting it into the hands of a private individual.
That to my mind is illegal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I
do not however think that the examples raised by the Defendants assist
them in the present case. Unlike the CPC which classifies certain offences
as compoundable, there is no provision in the Professional Engineers
Act which allows professional engineers to release or exempt themselves
from disciplinary proceedings by paying compensation. In any case,
clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement seeks to prohibit all complaints to
the PEB without drawing any distinction between minor and serious forms
of misconduct. I note moreover that the complaint which the Plaintiff
lodged to the PEB alleged <em>inter alia</em> that
Koh “[w]as both the qualified person supervising the additions and
alterations … and the builder of the said works” and that he had
“[d]emolished part of the pile cap without confirming the structural
integrity of the same”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> These are serious allegations as they
pertain to a conflict of interest on the part of Koh in the discharge
of his duties as a professional engineer as well as the safety of
certain works undertaken by him. Misconduct of this character can hardly
be regarded as a matter which can be excluded from oversight by
the PEB by an agreement between private parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     It
should be noted that there is a difference between the situation where
a contracting party undertakes not to file a complaint in future
and a complainant undertaking to write to a disciplinary body already
seised of jurisdiction informing that body that he is desirous of
withdrawing his complaint or that the parties have amicably settled
the matter. The difference lies in the effect of the contractual
undertaking on the statutory regime governing the professional’s
conduct. In the latter situation, unless the relevant legislation
provides otherwise, the disciplinary proceedings already commenced
are not affected by the subsequent withdrawal of the initial complaint:
see <em>Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh and another
v </em><em>Attorney-General</em> [2013]
4 SLR 483 at [5] on similar disciplinary proceedings against solicitors
under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed). It will then
be up to the disciplinary body to determine how it will dispose
of the matter, taking into consideration the information it has
received from the complainant. Accordingly, I would have had no
difficulty upholding that portion of clause 12 which required the
Plaintiff to “forthwith inform the Building and Construction Authority
that the matter has been resolved and another Professional Engineer
will be taking over the conduct of the matter”. By contrast, the
offending portion of clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement imposes
an unqualified prohibition on making complaints to the PEB. While
a complaint to the PEB under the Professional Engineers Act can
be made by persons other than the client of the professional engineer,
it has to be borne in mind that a large proportion of instances
of misconduct by professional engineers will only be brought to
the attention of the PEB through complaints from their clients.
To allow a professional engineer to enter into a contract with his
client to prohibit the client from lodging any complaint to the
PEB would significantly curtail the extent to which the professional
accountability envisaged by the Act can be achieved. Even if there
was a countervailing public policy consideration in allowing business
to be transacted freely and in upholding commercial bargains (as was
alluded to in <em>Barrett</em>), this would
be outweighed by the need to uphold professional accountability
in the present situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Since
this part of the clause is illegal and unenforceable, it follows
that the Plaintiff cannot be regarded to have acted in breach of
it. I should, however, add that my finding of illegality does not
render the entire Settlement Agreement void because the offending
portion of clause 12 can be severed from the rest of the agreement.
This is because I do not regard the Plaintiff’s obligation in the
offending portion as constituting the whole of his consideration
for the Settlement Agreement. The fact that the Plaintiff entrusted
a determination of exactly how much he would be paid for the Rectification
Works to an independent third party is, on its own, sufficient consideration
on his part. The failure of consideration therefore does not stand
in the way of the doctrine of severance applying in this case. The
requirement that the court must be able to run a “blue pencil” through the
offending portion without altering the meaning of or rendering senseless
the rest of clause 12 of the Settlement Agreement (see <em>Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D
&amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David</em> [2008]
1 SLR(R) 663 at [127]) in order for this doctrine to apply would
also clearly be satisfied in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    It
follows that neither party can be said to be in breach of the Settlement
Agreement, let alone in repudiatory breach of it. What has taken place
instead is that Chan’s award of the tender to Crystallite has been
set aside through no fault of either party. Although the Settlement
Agreement did not expressly provide for what would happen in this
situation, I cannot imagine that the parties would have contemplated
either: (a) that the entire Settlement Agreement they had reached
through mediation would simply unravel and they would be left to
pursue their original claims against each other; or (b) that the
matter could be remitted to the same professional engineer who had
been found to have acted partially for a fresh, impartial determination.
The essence of the contractual bargain between the parties was that
the Defendants would pay the Plaintiff the reasonable costs of rectification
works with a neutral third party determining the scope of the rectification
works and the costs of such works being primarily determined by
the tender process carried out by that neutral third party. If the
parties had, at the time of the negotiations, applied their mind
to the present scenario, they would in all likelihood have said,
“he must be replaced” and a replacement professional engineer appointed
in a similar manner. I therefore find that there would have been
an implied term in the Settlement Agreement to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I
should add that even if I were wrong about there being such an implied
term in the Settlement Agreement, the court does have the power substitute
alternative machinery for the contractual machinery in appropriate
cases (see [80] <em>supra</em>). In <em>Macro v Thompson</em> (see [58] <em>supra</em>), Walker J accepted that in that
case the circumstances justified an order for new valuations done
by a different expert, although he cautioned that this was not a
general rule (at 69):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The decision of the House of Lords in <em>Sudbrook Trading Estate Ltd v Eggleton</em> [1982]
3 All ER 1, [1983] 1 AC 444 establishes or clarifies the principle
that where contractual machinery for the ascertainment of value
is frustrated, the court has jurisdiction to resolve the difficulty
by prescribing alternative machinery, <b>provided
that the contractual machinery</b> (for instance, the nomination
of a single expert valuer) <b>was not an essential
and indispensable part of the contractual bargain</b>. …
In this case, therefore, without laying down any general rule, I
conclude that the court can and should provide alternative machinery.
[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The
proviso above that the contractual machinery must not be an essential
or indispensable part of the contractual bargain does not, in my judgment,
apply to prevent the court from substituting alternative machinery
in the present case. As I have indicated at [101] above, the contractual
bargain in this case was that the Defendants would pay the Plaintiffs
the reasonable costs of rectification works, the scope and costs
of which would be determined by a neutral professional engineer
and a tender process undertaken by him. It was not important to
the parties that Chan in particular had to be appointed as the professional
engineer. This was not like the case where, for example, the agreement
was to sell at a price fixed by a valuer who was named, or who,
by reason of holding some office such as the auditor of a company
whose shares were to be valued, would have special knowledge relevant
to the question of value, in which case the prescribed machinery
may well be regarded as essential: <em>Sudbrook
Trading Estate Ltd v Eggleton</em> [1983] 1 AC 444 at 483–484.
Rather, what was important to the parties in this case was simply
that the professional engineer be neutral and qualified for the
task. There is thus no reason why another professional engineer
should not be appointed in the proper manner to undertake the relevant
tasks under the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The
only gaps which need to be filled are the deadlines for the appointment
of the replacement professional engineer and for the work to be
carried out by him upon his appointment. In this vein, I note that
the Settlement Agreement envisaged short timelines. I therefore
direct as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
parties shall, within one week of the date of this judgment submit
three names to the Mediator, who shall thereafter appoint the Professional
Engineer from among the names submitted to him within a further
one week thereafter. If the Mediator fails to appoint a Professional
Engineer by then, either party is at liberty to apply to the court
to make the appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
appointed Professional Engineer shall act in accordance with clauses
6–10 of the Settlement Agreement, save that the joint site visit
referred to in clause 6 shall be undertaken within one week of his appointment
by the Mediator or the court and the scope and specifications of
the rectification works to be prepared pursuant to clause 6 is to
be set out within one week of the said site visit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The
Defendants are under an obligation to pay to the Plaintiff the costs
set out in clause 11 of the Settlement Agreement resulting from
this new appointment with the following qualifications:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
payment of $20,000 as compensation for moving and costs need not
be paid as the Defendants have already paid this sum; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     As
for the fees of the replacement professional engineer which the
Defendants have to pay to the Plaintiff, credit is to be given for
the $11,260 which had been paid earlier by them as the first instalment
of Chan’s fees. From the documents, it is clear that the contract
of appointment of Chan as the professional engineer pursuant to
which his fees were payable was one to which only the Plaintiff
and Chan were parties and to which the Defendants were strangers.
It will thus be for the Plaintiff to claim such refund from Chan
of the fees which have been paid by the Defendants on the Plaintiff’s
behalf although I express no view as to the extent of his legal
entitlement to do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_c"></a>(c)     For
the avoidance of doubt, the “duration of the Rectification Works”
in clause 11(c) of the Settlement Agreement is to be regarded as
referring to the duration of the Rectification Works as determined by
the replacement professional engineer. The Plaintiff cannot claim against
the Defendants for the rental and storage costs which he has already
incurred given that these were referable to the duration of the work
to be done pursuant to the tender award which I have set aside. As
to whether the Plaintiff may claim these costs from Chan under the contract
between them, this is not an issue which is before me in the present
case. These observations also apply with respect to any liability
incurred by the Plaintiff pursuant to the contract which Chan awarded
to Crystallite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alleged conspiracy between Chan
and the Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    While
the Defendants initially pleaded both lawful and unlawful conspiracy,
only unlawful conspiracy was pursued in their written submissions.
The alleged unlawful means was the Plaintiff’s breach of the Settlement
Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The
Defendants’ claim on conspiracy fails <em>in limine</em> since
I have found that there was no evidence of collusion on the part
of Chan and the Plaintiff and/or his agents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendants’ counterclaims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    To
recapitulate, the First Defendant counterclaimed the sum of $35,260
from the Plaintiff comprising: $20,000 paid to the Plaintiff as compensation
for moving and costs under the Settlement Agreement; $11,260 being
the first instalment of Chan’s fees; and $4,000 being the outstanding
professional fees due in relation to the Additional Works. The Second
Defendant counterclaimed the total sum of $146,215.50 (including GST)
for the Additional Works, as well as damages to be assessed in relation
to the Plaintiff’s complaint to the PEB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In
the light of my earlier findings, it is clear that the only items
in the Defendants’ counterclaims that remain to be considered relate
to the Additional Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The
Defendants’ case was that the Additional Works had taken place between
July 2010 and April 2011. There were no quotations, invoices or other
documentation for the Additional Works, which Mui Ling said were undertaken
based on trust between the parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
the Defendants submitted that the Second Defendant had clearly mentioned
its intention to claim for the costs of these Additional Works in
the Defendants’ summary of facts which was submitted prior to and
for the purpose of the mediation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I
find that the Defendants are not entitled to their counterclaims
in respect of the Additional Works. It was expressly stated in the
Settlement Agreement that “[t]he Parties wish to enter into this
Settlement Agreement to achieve a full, final and complete settlement
of all claims, issues and/or disputes (actual or potential, present
or future) among them in respect of the Contract”, the “Contract”
being the contract for the A&amp;A Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> The
Defendants’ counterclaim would have been part of the claims which were
the subject of the compromise under the Settlement Agreement. The reference
to them in the Defendants’ summary of facts puts beyond doubt the
fact that the Additional Works were covered by the mediation and
the Settlement Agreement. The parties had, in my judgment, agreed
that all claims or disputes would be superseded by the Settlement
Agreement which would now encompass the parties’ entire agreement
as to matters arising out of the A&amp;A Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    While
the Plaintiff did not succeed in any of his claims, the Defendants
only succeeded in their claim to set aside the award of the contract
to Crystallite by Chan. However, a significant part of the proceedings
concerned the evidence pertaining to this issue. In the circumstances,
I order the Plaintiff to pay to the Defendants half of the Defendants’
costs, to be agreed or taxed.</p>
