To alleviate the hardship occasioned on defendants, such injunctions are often paired with standard exceptions, which include a provision permitting the defendant to deal or dispose with its assets in the ordinary and proper course of its business (the “Ordinary Course exception”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendants in the present case were subject to a Mareva injunction and granted the Ordinary Course exception. However, after the defendants had made significant withdrawals by relying on the Ordinary Course exception, the plaintiff took out a summons to restrict their use of the exception. Andrew Ang SJ granted the summons in part. Thereafter, the plaintiff alleged that new facts had surfaced, which justify further variations to the Mareva injunction to prevent the defendants from unscrupulously dissipating assets under the premise of the Ordinary Course exception. The present summons was brought before me, as the trial judge for the pending action, for my consideration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff, Sumifru Singapore Pte Ltd, brought an action against the defendants.

In <span class="font-italic">Thevarajah, </span>the applicant-claimant sought, among others, a variation to the “ordinary and proper course of business” exception in a Mareva injunction, which it had obtained against the respondent-defendants. In gist, the variation would restrict the disposal of real property by the defendants, and require the defendants to provide specified information relating to any proposed sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of their real property. Such specified information included providing the identity of and the defendants’ relationship to the counter-party of any transaction of real property, as well as the total purchase price and consideration to be received in such a transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The variation was granted by the judge, who considered that reasonable doubts were raised about the transactions in relation to the defendants’ real property. In relation to one property named “The Devonshire”, the defendants had informed that the property was to be sold for £1m, and that all of the sale proceeds of that property were to be paid to the Bank of Cyprus to reduce their indebtedness to the bank. No details were however provided of the prospective buyers, save to say that the sale would be an arm’s length transaction and therefore in the ordinary course of business. However, one of the defendants, Mr Riordan, had previously stated on affidavit that “The Devonshire” was valued at about £1.8m, and another judge had found it to be worth just under £1.325m. The proposed sale price was thus well below both figures, thus generating suspicion that the transactions might be at an undervalue and/or to a related party of the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further doubts were raised concerning two other properties owned by the defendants, namely “The Blarney Stone” and “The Jester”, for which no particulars were provided. In relation to The Blarney Stone, the circumstances of any possible transaction was opaque, and the actual balance due to the chargees of the property were not disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Given the opaqueness of the defendants’ dealings with its real property, which were subject to the Mareva injunction, the judge considered that the variations sought in relation to the real property were “reasonably required by the [claimant] for the policing of” the Mareva injunction (<span class="font-italic">Thevarajah </span>at [45]). Particulars of any intended purchaser would be highly relevant to the question of whether the purchaser was related to the defendants; if there were a connection, this was likely to generate suspicion deserving of investigation. Contrarily, if the purchaser was a reputable purchaser dealing at arm’s length, any suspicion would be allayed. It was also appropriate for the claimant to know how the defendants intended to distribute monies received for the properties, for only by knowing that could the claimant be satisfied that the proceeds were being properly accounted for.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the outset, it bears emphasising that the present application is <span class="font-italic">not </span>an appeal against the orders granted by Ang SJ, who considered the submissions of the parties relating to the alleged opacity of the defendants’ withdrawals, which related in main to the rice trade and shipping services which were purportedly provided by the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Hence, to ensure that the present summons is not utilised as a backdoor appeal against Ang SJ’s decision (which has not been appealed against), only points that were not raised before Ang SJ in SUM 3820/2019 ought to be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In this regard, the plaintiff submits that the defendants have breached both the Disclosure order and the Repayment order made by Ang SJ.

</div> The alleged reason for the delayed release of the rice cargo was that, although the taxes for 1,500 MT of rice cargo had been paid for by August 2019, the taxes on the remaining 2,500 MT of rice cargo was only paid on or around 28 August 2019. That was when one of the second defendant’s customers, ANA Traders, agreed to assist the second defendant with its tax obligations and thereafter purchase 35,000 of the released bags of rice. Therefore, until 28 August 2019, there was simply no way for the second defendant to sell the 4,000 MT of rice cargo.

As observed in <span class="font-italic">The “Nagasaki Spirit”</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 878<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16], “the sole purpose of the [Mareva] injunction is the prohibition of dealings by the defendant in order to defeat a judgment against him”. Hence, the requirement of showing a real risk of dissipation lies at the heart of the court’s power to grant any Mareva injunction. Therefore, merely demonstrating <span class="font-italic">dishonesty </span>on the part of the defendant is insufficient for the grant of a Mareva injunction, unless such dishonesty had a real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation of assets: <span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves </span>at [5] and [93]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this case, all the court has before it is <span class="font-italic">conflicting </span>expert evidence relating to the legality of the defendants’ commercial exploits, which have not been tested under cross-examination. <span class="font-italic">E</span><span class="font-italic">ven if </span>this court were minded to find that the second defendant’s rice trade is illegal on the back of the conflicting expert evidence, this would not justify a variation of the Mareva Injunction. Such illegality, in and of itself, simply does not go towards showing a real risk of dissipation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Furthermore, a finding of such illegality would not support the purpose of the Mareva Injunction, which seeks to ensure that there remains a sufficient pool of assets available for enforcement should the plaintiff obtain a judgment against the defendants. A determination of the illegality of the rice trade could stifle the repatriation of the proceeds from the rice trade, thereby indirectly allowing the defendants to keep such proceeds out of the jurisdiction, and possibly beyond the reach of the plaintiff. Therefore, I did not find it appropriate to consider the issue of illegality that was so fervently argued before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Harbor Star</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I also make no findings as regards the intended withdrawal for the Harbor Star invoices. The defendants evidently complied with the Notice obligation by notifying the plaintiff that such withdrawals were to be made. As the defendants submit, the proper application to be made to prevent such a withdrawal is an application for an <span class="font-italic">injunction</span>, as Ang SJ had explicitly declined to grant the plaintiff’s application for any future withdrawals to be contingent on the plaintiff’s approval.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Business proceeds from the rice trade</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Turning to the other grounds raised by the plaintiff, it appears to me that the real complaint is that while significant sums of money have been channelled for the defendants’ alleged business expenses, little has been returned to the second defendant’s OCBC Account. These are however not new arguments, as, before Ang SJ, the plaintiff had similarly raised doubts about the transactions relating to the rice trade.

</div> While new grounds have allegedly surfaced since the hearing of SUM 3820/2019, they relate in the main to alleged misrepresentations by the defendants. In particular, the key allegation appears to be that the defendants had wrongfully represented to Ang SJ that there were no business proceeds from the rice cargo, when in fact there were such business proceeds. In direct response, the first defendant has explained, on affidavit, that the rice cargo was only sold from September 2019 onwards, <span class="font-italic">after </span>the taxes on the rice cargo were paid.

</div> Yet, to-date, there is no evidence that the defendants have any business presence in Japan or the USA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Reviewing the evidence in totality, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case to make further orders to fortify the orders made by Ang SJ. In view of the defendants’ conduct subsequent to the learned judge’s orders, this is necessary to ensure that the defendants are restrained from evading justice by disposing of assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, with the result that if the plaintiff obtains judgment in the action, such judgment may remain unsatisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Variation order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">A J Bekhor &amp; Co Ltd v Bilton </span>[1981] 2 All ER 565, the English Court of Appeal observed that a means of policing the Mareva injunction is to order the cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit (at 579). Alternatively, the permission to allow the defendant to remove further money pursuant to the Ordinary Course exception may be withdrawn unless and until the defendant has made a full and proper disclosure of the matters which the court thought were necessary to establish the true nature of the defendant’s assets, and that the defendant has given a proper explanation of his conduct between the material dates (at 579).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, while the plaintiff has sought a multitude of variations, which include the removal of a variation granted by Ang SJ, the fundamental purpose of the plaintiff’s application in the present summons is to preserve, and to increase to a satisfactory amount, the pool of assets available, to avoid the prospect of a barren judgment. To achieve this, the appropriate order to be made ought to be one which would prod the defendants to return the business proceeds from the rice trade, and thereafter restrict unwarranted withdrawals from the OCBC Account. In my view, the Disclosure and Repayment orders made by Ang SJ go some way towards achieving these goals, and any variation order that I grant ought therefore to <span class="font-italic">supplement</span>, rather than <span class="font-italic">overhaul, </span>the orders made prior.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Therefore, instead of removing parts of Ang SJ’s order, I make the following <span class="font-italic">additional </span>orders: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the defendants make full and frank disclosure of the amount of business proceeds stemming from the rice trade that are available to be repatriated to the OCBC Account within ten business days of the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) After the disclosures in (a) have been made, all of such business proceeds, as well as additional business proceeds which are collected in relation to the rice trade, are to be remitted to the OCBC Account within 15 business days from the date of this judgment or the date of the collection of such proceeds (whichever is applicable).
