</div> Put another way, the defendant says that even if the Disputed Reciprocal Agreements confer on the plaintiff the exclusive right to <span class="font-italic">authorise</span> communication of the Disputed Musical Works to the public and to authorise the public performance of these works, the plaintiff still is not the exclusive licensee of the underlying rights to do these acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There are two sub-issues which the defendant’s submissions raise: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the exclusive right to authorise the doing of an act in relation to a copyright work is separate and distinct from the doing of the act itself? For convenience, I will refer to these as the “Right of Authorisation” and “Underlying Right” respectively; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if the first sub-issue is answered in the affirmative, whether being the owner or the exclusive licensee of the Right of Authorisation necessarily implies ownership of or an exclusive licence over the Underlying Right? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 With regards the first sub-issue, I find that the Right of Authorisation is indeed separate and distinct from the Underlying Right. I say this for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, I agree with the defendant that s 9(2) of the Copyright Act indicates that the two rights are distinct. To appreciate the significance of s 9(2), it must be recalled that copyright comprises “a bundle of legally enforceable exclusive rights in respect of certain types of products of ‘intellectual’ activity” (<span class="font-italic">PCCW Media Ltd v M1 Ltd and others</span> [2018] 5 SLR 375 at [29], citing George Wei, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore</span> (SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of </span><span class="font-italic">Copyright in Singapore</span>”) at para 1.1). In a similar vein, s 26(1) of the Copyright Act expressly recognises that copyright in relation to different types of work consists of different bundles of exclusive rights: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Nature of copyright in original works</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">26.</span>—(1)  For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a work, is the exclusive right —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to do all or any of the following acts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) to reproduce the work in a material form;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) to publish the work if the work is unpublished;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) to perform the work in public;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) to communicate the work to the public;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) to make an adaptation of the work;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vi) to do, in relation to a work that is an adaptation of the first-mentioned work, any of the acts specified in relation to the first-mentioned work in sub-paragraphs (i) to (v);</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the case of an artistic work, to do all or any of the following acts:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(i) to reproduce the work in a material form;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(ii) to publish the work in Singapore or any country in relation to which this Act applies, if the work is unpublished;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(iii) to communicate the work to the public; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) in the case of a computer program, to enter into a commercial rental arrangement in respect of the program unless the program is not the essential object of the rental.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29  Therefore, because s 9(2) of the Copyright Act refers <span class="font-italic">separately</span> to “the exclusive right to do an act in relation to a work…” and “the exclusive right to authorise a person to do that act”, I do not think the Right of Authorisation and the Underlying Right are one and the same. It is trite that “Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”. Courts should therefore “endeavour to give significance to every word in an enactment” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [38]). Parliament’s express reference to an “exclusive right to authorise a person to do that act in relation to that work…” signals that the Right of Authorisation is conceptually distinct from the Underlying Right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  In my view, s 9(2) simply describes a starting point: that all Underlying Rights are accompanied by a corresponding Right of Authorisation. This, however, does not mean that the Right of Authorisation cannot later be severed from the “parent” Underlying Right, such as by way of an assignment or exclusive licence. Nothing in the Copyright Act prohibits such severance. In fact, I agree with the defendant that s 25(1) of the Copyright Act (reproduced at [24] above) allows the copyright owner to divide the bundle of exclusive rights, such that each “copyright owner only has rights of action in relation to … the particular act or class of acts that his ownership rights are in respect of.”

</div>
</div> Although s 25 deals with, among other issues, dividing the <span class="font-italic">ownership</span> of multiple exclusive rights comprised in the copyright in a work (see also <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span><span class="font-italic">Laws of Singapore </span>vol 13(3) (LexisNexis, 2021) at para 160.040, n 3), I see nothing preventing a copyright owner from granting an exclusive license in respect of the Right of Authorisation only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, one may question why Parliament did not enumerate the Right of Authorisation when setting out the bundle of exclusive rights for each type of copyright work in s 26 of the Copyright Act. One answer is that there was no need to do so <span class="font-italic">because</span> of s 9(2). In fact, s 9(2) renders any such enumeration in s 26(1) tautologous. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Even further still, and turning now to my second point, cases commenting on or applying the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (“the Australian Act”) make clear that an Underlying Right and its corresponding Right of Authorisation are separate and distinct. s 9 of the Copyright Act is modelled on s 13 of the Australian Act. The annotation to s 9 of the Copyright Act reads: “[<span class="font-italic">Aust. 1968, s.13</span>]”. In fact, the language in s 13(2) of the Australian Act is identical to that in s 9(2) of the Copyright Act. More generally, at the Second Reading of the Copyright Bill (Bill No 8/1986) (“Copyright Bill 1986”), then Second Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, confirmed that the Copyright Bill 1986 “is modelled largely on Australia's copyright law” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(5 May 1986) vol 48 (“Second Reading of the Copyright Bill 1986”) at col 12). Thus, Australian authorities are persuasive for our purposes. I refer to two such authorities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">WEA International Inc</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Hanimex Corporation Ltd </span>(1987) 77 ALR 456 (“<span class="font-italic">WEA International</span>”), Gummow J set out the distinction between an Underlying Right and its corresponding Right of Authorisation in these terms (at 466): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was clear after <span class="font-italic">Ash v Hutchinson and Co (Publishers) Ltd</span> [1936] Ch 489, that the [Copyright Act 1911 (c 46) (UK)] gave, for example, the owner of copyright in a literary work both the sole right of reproducing it and the sole right of authorising such reproduction and that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">those rights were</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">separate and distinct</span> so that infringement of each was a distinct tort. That the same was true of ‘authorization’ in respect of the [Australian Act] was accepted by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">University of New South Wales v Moorhouse</span> (1975) 133 CLR 1 ; 6 ALR 193.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">University of New South Wales v Moorhouse</span><span class="font-italic"> and Angus &amp; Robertson (Publishers) Pty Ltd</span> (1975) 133 CLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Moorhouse</span>”), the High Court of Australia held that the appellant university had authorized the doing, by one Brennan, of the act of reproducing the literary work <span class="font-italic">The Americans, Baby</span> in a material form. The appellant thereby infringed the respondents’ copyright in the said work (at 210). Brennan was a graduate of the appellant university. Pertinently, the court confirmed that the appellant itself did <span class="font-italic">not</span> perform the act of photocopying, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the underlying act of reproducing the literary work (at 199). Therefore, the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Moorhouse</span> corroborates Gummow J’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">WEA International </span>that infringement of the Underlying Right and Right of Authorisation are separate causes of action rooted in breaches of distinct exclusive rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For these reasons, the first sub-issue is answered in the affirmative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I now turn to the second sub-issue. To summarise thus far, because I have found that the Right of Authorisation is distinct and severable from its corresponding Underlying Right, the Disputed Reciprocal Agreements do not make the plaintiff an exclusive licensee of the Underlying Rights which are pleaded to be infringed. Clause 2(1) of the plaintiff’s reciprocal agreement with PRS only permits the plaintiff to “<span class="font-italic">authorise</span> the public performance, broadcasting and inclusion in a cable programme of any work in the Repertoire of PRS” [emphasis added]. Art 1(I) of the plaintiff’s reciprocal agreement with APRA similarly only allows the plaintiff to “grant the necessary<span class="font-italic"> authorisations</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>for all public performances<span class="font-italic"> </span>… of musical works” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37  Thus, for the plaintiff to have standing in this Suit, I must go further to find that the owner or an exclusive licensee of the Right of Authorisation necessarily owns or is an exclusive licensee of the Underlying Right. With respect, I am unable to find that this is so for the following two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, to say otherwise will contravene the spirit of s 25(1) of the Copyright Act. For assignments, s 25(1) makes clear that a partial assignment of exclusive rights will only transfer ownership of the exclusive rights which are the subject of the assignment, and nothing more. In my judgment, consistent with the spirit of s 25(1) of the Copyright Act, the rights obtained under an exclusive license must similarly be confined to the exclusive rights which are the subject-matter of the exclusive licence. Put another way, once the Right of Authorisation and its Underlying Right are severed, I fail to see why being the owner or exclusive licensee of the Right of Authorisation necessarily implies the same over the Underlying Right, or vice versa.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, there is little commercial sense in finding that being an owner or exclusive licensee of the Right of Authorisation necessarily implies ownership of or a licence over the Underlying Right. Conceivably, the holder of copyright in a particular work may wish to retain ownership of the Underlying Right, while at the same time appointing a separate person (“X”) to be his exclusive licensee of the corresponding Right of Authorisation, where X has no skill or expertise in performing the Underlying Right itself.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In these premises, the plaintiff is not the exclusive licensee of the right to communicate the Disputed Musical Works to the public or to perform these works in public. Thus, it lacks standing to bring claims for primary infringement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether uplinking of the Encrypted Channels containing the Disputed Musical Works to a satellite constitutes communication to the public under </span><div class="font-weight-bold font-italic"><br/></div><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s 26(1)(a) of the Copyright Act?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 My finding on the plaintiff’s lack of standing for primary infringement is sufficient to dispose of the above claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the defendant communicates the Disputed Musical Works to the public and performs the works in public). In case I am wrong, I go on to consider the Second Question in the O 14 r 12 application. For the avoidance of doubt, the Statement of Claim dated 5 April 2021 (Amendment No 2) (“ASOC2”) pleads that the defendant’s uplinking activities constitute public performance of the Disputed Musical Works. The Second Question, however, does not extend to whether uplinking programmes amounts to a public performance under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii). The following analysis thus focuses on whether uplinking activities constitute communication to the public under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For context, there are two main forms of satellite broadcasting (see Susanna Leong, <span class="font-italic">Intellectual Property Law of Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 08.158): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, direct broadcasting by satellite is where “the signal of the originating broadcaster is transmitted through the satellite direct to the receivers of the public.

Prior to 1987, copyright protection in Singapore was provided for in the Copyright Act 1911 (c 46) (UK) (“Copyright Act 1911 (UK)”), a piece of imperial legislation, supplemented by the Copyright Act 1914 (Ordinance 18 of 1914) and the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act (Cap 64, 1985 Rev Ed) (Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singap</span><span class="font-italic">ore</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2021) (“Ng-Loy Wee Loon”) at para 4.1.4). Under the Copyright Act 1911 (UK), broadcasting was not a specific right conferred on copyright works. The approach was to try and treat broadcasting as a type of public performance (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore</span> at para 3.15). Subsequently, s 89 of the Copyright Act 1987 (Act 2 of 1987) (“Copyright Act 1987”) conferred copyright in Singapore for the first time on both television and sound broadcasts (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore</span> at para 3.13). Following that, the right to communicate copyright works to the public was introduced in the Copyright (Amendment) Act 2004, s 8. The right to communicate works to the public was enacted to bring Singapore’s copyright framework in line with international standards, such as that in Article 8 of the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Copyright Treaty 1996 (20 December 1996) 2186 UNTS 121 (entered into force 17 April 2005) (“WIPO Copyright Treaty”) (Leong and Chen’s Article at paras 4–6; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(16 November 2004) vol 78 (“Second Reading of Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004”) at col 1044). Art 8 provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing any communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At the Second Reading of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, said that the right to communicate works to the public “encompasses both the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> broadcasting and cable programme rights, and also the right to control the dissemination of works on the Internet” [emphasis added] (Second Reading of Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004 at col 1043). As such, the former right of broadcasting was subsumed within the right of communication to the public (Ng-Loy Wee Loon at para 9.5.2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 With this background in mind, and having regard to the parties’ submissions, I agree with the defendant that uplinking signals to a satellite in the context of PTP transmissions does not constitute a broadcast and, therefore, a communication to the public under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Copyright Act. This is because a broadcast must objectively involve direct transmission to the general public or a part thereof. In reaching this conclusion, I am guided by the three-step approach to purposive statutory interpretation outlined in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng </span><span class="font-italic">Bock</span> at [37]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Under the first step of the <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> framework, the definition of “broadcast” under s 7(1) of the Copyright Act – “broadcast by wireless telegraphy” – does not address the issue at hand. Like Sheppard J in <span class="font-italic">Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd </span>(1995) 31 IPR 289 at 305–306, I then turn to the ordinary meaning of the word “broadcast”. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, “broadcast” means to “scatter widely abroad” or to “widely disseminate”.

</div>
</div> Even further still, Sheppard J noted that for radio and television broadcasts, the Oxford English Dictionary states that broadcast means (at 306):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘to disseminate (a message, news, a musical or dramatic performance, or any audible or visible matter) from a radio or television transmitting station <span class="font-italic">to the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">receiving</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">sets</span><span class="font-italic"> of listeners and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">viewers</span>...’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Based on the foregoing, one interpretation of “broadcast” is that the work must be transmitted directly to the general public or a part thereof (“the First Interpretation”). But, on another view, the plain meaning of “broadcast” does not shut out the conceptual possibility of the PTP transmission being downlinked to numerous intermediate broadcasters which together form a <span class="font-italic">part of</span> the general public (“the Second Interpretation”). This is especially so if I am wrong about persons overseas not forming part of the “public” under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Copyright Act (see [107] below). Under this latter interpretation, uplinking in the context of PTP transmissions <span class="font-italic">may</span> amount to a broadcast.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, when determining the ordinary meaning of a word or provision, courts should also have due regard to the context of that text within the written law as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 373 at [59(a)]). There is one contextual clue which leads me to prefer the First Interpretation of the word “broadcast”. Namely, I agree with the defendant and the learned author of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore </span>at para 3.21 that s 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Copyright Act is significant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Provisions relating to the making of a work or other subject-matter</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  For the purposes of this Act, a television broadcast or sound broadcast shall be deemed to have been made by the person by whom, at the time when, and from the place from which —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the visual images or sounds in question, or both, as the case may be, are broadcast; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the case of a television broadcast or sound broadcast made by the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">technique known as direct broadcasting</span> by satellite, the visual images or sounds in question, or both, as the case may be, are transmitted to the satellite transponder.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and bold; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Section 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Copyright Act stipulates the means for identifying <span class="font-italic">who</span> made a television or sound broadcast by “the technique known as direct broadcasting by satellite”, but not PTP transmissions. This suggests that Parliament did not consider PTP transmissions to be broadcasts under the Copyright Act. As George Wei observed, if it were otherwise, “statutory provisions as to where the point-to-point ‘broadcast’ was made from could have been expected” (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Copyright in Singapore</span> at para 3.21). I accept the learned author’s view for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Singapore appears to have adopted s 16(5) from the Copyright Act 1956 (c 74) (UK) (“Copyright Act 1956 (UK)”), as amended by the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (c 46) (UK) (“Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (UK)”). I say this because the amendments to s 14 of the Copyright Act 1956 (UK) provided for in Schedule 5, para 6(7) of the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (UK) are <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> to s 16(5) of our Copyright Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For reference, I set out the relevant provisions in the aforesaid UK statutes.

The eventual bill passed by both houses of the UK Parliament indeed did not do so. The following academic texts also confirm that, in the UK, PTP transmissions only began counting as broadcasts under s 6 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c 48) (UK) (“Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK)”): Adrian Speck <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Laddie, Prescott and Vitoria: The Modern Law of Copyright</span> vol 1 (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Laddie, Prescott and </span><span class="font-italic">Vitoria</span>”) at paras 8.12 (Illustration 5), 8.21–8.24; Nicholas Caddick, Gwilym Harbottle &amp; Uma Suthersanen, <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James on Copyright</span> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James</span>”) at para 3-275; Gerald Dworkin &amp; Richard D Taylor, <span class="font-italic">Blackstone’s Guide to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988: The Law of Copyright and Related Rights </span>(Blackstone Press Limited, 1989) at p 195. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Singapore has not enacted the equivalent of s 6 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK). Instead, having incorporated s 14(10) of the Copyright Act 1956 (UK), as amended by the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (UK), into our statute books on 10 April 1987 when the Copyright Act 1987 came into force, the UK’s intention to <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> PTP transmissions from the ambit of “broadcasting” in the Copyright Act 1956 (UK) was likely also imported. Therefore, I prefer the ordinary meaning of “broadcast” which requires the copyright work to be disseminated <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to the general public or a part thereof. For completeness, I rely on s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) to justify reference to the debate in the House of Lords. The debate confirms that the meaning of “broadcast” is its ordinary meaning <span class="font-italic">when</span> read in its context within the Copyright Act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I also reject the plaintiff’s submissions in relation to the second and third stages of the <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>framework. Namely, the plaintiff argues that the 2004 amendments, which subsumed the right to broadcast under the right to communicate the work to the public, were motivated by the policy of protecting the rights of copyright owners. According to the plaintiff, this means that by uplinking signals for the copyright holder’s public (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Distributors), the defendant communicated the Disputed Musical Works to the public and infringed its copyright.

</div>
</div>
</div> It is the plaintiff’s case that the defendant ought to be separately licensed from the Distributors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff cites, among others, the following portions of the Second Reading of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004 at cols 1041 and 1053: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Copyright Act to enhance and strengthen our copyright regime, particularly to ensure that our copyright laws remain relevant in an age of rapid technological development. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In conclusion, let me say that these amendments in the Bill, although fairly complicated and technical, are necessary to update Singapore's copyright legislation to meet the needs of businesses, creators and users in the fast-evolving digital age.  It provides enhanced enforcement measures to encourage stakeholders in the creative industries to further engage in high value-added activities in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The problem is that the plaintiff is asking me to use the extraneous material above as a basis to depart from the ordinary meaning of the word “broadcast”, when read in the context of s 16(5) of the Copyright Act. This is only permissible if the meaning of “broadcast” is ambiguous or obscure <br/>(s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) Interpretation Act) or if its ordinary meaning leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable (s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) Interpretation Act) (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [48]). However, <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> also clarified that statements in Parliament must be “clear and unequivocal to be of any real use” and that the statements “should be directed to the very point in question to be especially helpful” (at [52(a)], [52(c)]). Evidently, Parliament did not say that all satellite transmissions to the copyright holder’s public, including uplinking in the context of PTP transmissions, are infringing acts. Therefore, the extraneous material relied upon is no basis for interpreting “broadcast” in the manner advanced by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Further, the plaintiff’s complaint that the First Interpretation of the word “broadcast” curtails the rights of copyright owners in the area of broadcasting has no leg to stand on. If my reasons at [54]–[67] are correct, this means that before the 2004 amendments, the right “to broadcast the work” in s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Copyright Act (1999 Rev Ed)”) similarly did not encompass PTP transmissions. This is because the ordinary meaning of the word “broadcast” also applies to the Copyright Act (1999 Rev Ed) and s 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) therein is identically worded to that in the latest revised edition of the Copyright Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I next deal briefly with other points raised by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 First, the plaintiff’s reliance on Tan Tee Jim’s 1995 Article does not assist it. Tan Tee Jim noted that unlike in many countries where transmissions are not treated as broadcasts unless they are intended for reception by the general public, the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Rev Ed) (“Copyright Act (1988 Rev Ed)”) did not contain such a requirement. The learned author raised the example of s 6(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK). That provision, as originally enacted, provided that a transmission must fulfil either of the following conditions in order to constitute a broadcast:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) is capable of being lawfully received by members of the public, or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) is transmitted for presentation to members of the public; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He also stressed that the Copyright Act (1988 Rev Ed) merely defined “broadcast” as a broadcast by wireless telegraphy, and that the Act deemed broadcasts to be made by the persons by whom, at the time when, and from the place from which, the visual images or sounds constituting the broadcast, or both, are broadcast (s 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act (1988 Rev Ed)). In this light, he opined that a defendant is liable for infringement as long as it transmits or authorises the transmission of copyright works to a satellite (Tan Tee Jim’s 1995 Article at p 50). In other words, PTP transmissions are infringing acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 However, s 6(1)(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK) extended the meaning of “broadcast” to PTP transmissions. That Singapore did not enact an equivalent of s 6(1)(b) points away from PTP transmissions being broadcasts under the Copyright Act. Although PTP transmissions are not directly receivable by members of the public, it is the public and not the intermediate broadcasters who are the ultimate audience. As such, PTP transmissions may be transmissions “for presentation to members of the public” within the meaning of s 6(1)(b) (<span class="font-italic">Laddie, </span><span class="font-italic">Prescott and Vitoria</span> at paras 8.12 (Illustration 5), 8.24; <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James </span>at para 3-275). Further, although s 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act, on its face, is wide enough to apply to PTP transmissions, the deliberations in the House of Lords excerpted at [62] above make clear that s 16(5)’s predecessor in the UK was not intended to apply to PTP transmissions. Therefore, the absence of a provision similar to s 6(1)(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (UK) in Singapore, the history behind s 16(5) of the Copyright Act and the ordinary meaning of the word “broadcast” (see [55] above) weigh strongly in favour of the First Interpretation of “broadcast” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there must be direct transmission to the general public or a part thereof).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, Leong and Chen’s Article hurts, rather than helps, the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff cites paras 20–22 of this article for the proposition that a communication to the public by satellite transmission may be established without proving reception of the satellite signal.

</div>
</div> However, in those paragraphs, the learned authors were addressing the question of <span class="font-italic">when </span>a communication to the public occurs. They simply made the point that “for purposes of determining when a communication occurs through transmission of a work by electronic means”, one need only show that the work has been transmitted to potential recipients, without needing to prove actual receipt. This does not address the separate issue of what kind of transmissions are communications <span class="font-italic">to the public</span>. In fact, the learned authors at para 50, citing <span class="font-italic">The Law of C</span><span class="font-italic">opyright </span>at pp 171–194, submitted that after the 2004 amendments and the reclassification of the right to broadcast under the broader umbrella provision of a right to communicate to the public, “the better view is that broadcasting does involve some notion of a direct transmission to the general public or a class thereof.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Third, <span class="font-italic">Total English Learning Global </span>is not relevant to the interpretation of “broadcast”. The plaintiff in that case alleged that the defendant had infringed copyright in various artistic, literary and musical works by using them in the operation of its English literacy educational programmes (at [2], [4], [19]).

In particular, the “main objective” of the second part of Art 8 is to include “interactive on-demand acts of communication” within the copyright owner’s bundle of rights (Explanatory Note at para 10.11). An example of an on-demand communication is providing a clickable internet link on a website that allows users of that website to link to a copyright work on another website (<span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James </span>at para 7-229). In other words, for a work to have been made available within the meaning of Art 8 (and hence s 7(1) of the Copyright Act), any person must be able to exercise their “individual choice” to access the work (Explanatory Note at paras 10.11–10.12). Therefore, uploading a work onto a password protected cloud storage system would not constitute a communication (<span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James </span>at para 7-231).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this case, I am unable to find that by uplinking the Encrypted Channels, the defendants had allowed any person to access the Disputed Musical Works at their choosing.

Therefore, the defendant’s actions are comparable to the uploading of works to a password protected cloud storage system.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>stated that the “public” ordinarily connotes “all members of the community or a section of the public. A substantial number of persons can sometimes be ‘the public’” (at [24]). The above proposition is uncontroversial and supported by the following authorities. <span class="font-italic">Copinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and Skone James</span> states that one of the principles relevant to determining if a work has been communicated to the public is that the “public” means an indeterminate number of recipients and implies, moreover, a fairly large number of persons (at para 7-237). The learned authors cite a line of European cases in support of this principle, including <span class="font-italic">Sociedad General de </span><span class="font-italic">Autores y Editores de Espana (SGAE) v Rafael Hoteles SL </span>Case C-306/05, EU:C:2006:764 at [37]–[38], <https: curia.europa.eu="" juris="" liste.jsf?num="C-306/05">  (accessed 19 October 2021) and <span class="font-italic">ITV Broadcasting Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v TVCatchup Ltd </span>Case C-607/11, EU:C:2013:147 (“<span class="font-italic">ITV Broadcasting</span>”) at [32], <https: curia.europa.eu="" juris="" liste.jsf?num="C-607/11&amp;language=EN"> (accessed 19 October 2021). Both cases were cited for the same principle in <span class="font-italic">SBS Belgium</span> at [21]. This principle was also endorsed in the UK in <span class="font-italic">TuneIn Inc v Warner Music UK Ltd and another company</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 441 (“<span class="font-italic">TuneIn</span>”) at [70(11)] and [77]. </https:></https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 However, in my view, the question of whether a communication has been made to the public is a multi-factorial inquiry. The number of persons to whom the work is communicated is only one of several factors to be considered. In addition, the court may consider factors such as whether the recipients of the communication are the copyright owner’s public. Under this factor, if the recipients of the communication are persons from whom the owner is entitled to expect payment for the work’s authorised communication, this would weigh in favour of the communication having been made to the public (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (HC)</span> at 658).

</div>
</div> Briefly, Prof Ng-Loy’s Article argues that if <span class="font-italic">Telstra (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was applied in <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span>, the respondents’ counterclaim for infringement would not have failed. I now summarise the salient portions of <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span> before addressing Prof Ng-Loy’s argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 RecordTV Pte Ltd (“RecordTV”) owned an internet-based business that allowed its registered users (“Registered Users”) to request the recording of free-to-air broadcasts in Singapore using its platform, the iDVR. Registered Users were able to play back and/or delete the recordings that they requested to be recorded. Registered Users operated the iDVR system remotely from home or elsewhere via a web browser. Usage of the iDVR was free-of-charge, and access to it was restricted to persons who were legally entitled to view and record the respondents’ (collectively referred to as “MediaCorp”) shows (at [5]). Persons who held valid television licences in Singapore were in effect licensed by MediaCorp to view its shows. By virtue of s 114 of the Copyright Act, persons in Singapore with valid television licences could also make copies of MediaCorp’s shows for their own “private and domestic use” (at [5]). MediaCorp was the copyright owner of various free-to-air broadcasts and films whose copyright RecordTV was alleged to have infringed by means of the iDVR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Court of Appeal held that the shows which the Registered Users requested to be recorded were not communicated to the public. One of the court’s reasons was that the recorded shows were only communicated to the relevant Registered Users privately and individually. Although any member of the public could register with RecordTV to become a Registered User, he had no immediate access to all (or any) of the MediaCorp shows already recorded by RecordTV. A Registered User was only allowed to access and view recordings which he had requested (at [26]). Even the aggregate of private communications to each Registered User was not, in that instance, a communication to the public (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In Prof Ng-Loy’s view, if the court in <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had been referred to <span class="font-italic">Telstra (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and European authorities taking a similar position, RecordTV’s Registered Users would have qualified as the “copyright owner’s public”. This is because RecordTV provided, in a <span class="font-italic">commercial</span> setting, the service of recording free-to-air broadcasts in Singapore and allowing the Registered Users to play or delete the recordings they requested (see Prof Ng-Loy’s Article at pp 383–385). Accordingly, RecordTV would have infringed Mediacorp’s copyright. In the present case, the defendant pleads that it operates its business for profit.

The CJEU stated in <span class="font-italic">Reha</span><span class="font-italic"> Training Gesellschaft für Sport- und Unfallrehabilitation mbH v Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte eV (GEMA) </span>Case C-117/15,<span class="font-italic"> </span>EU:C:2016:379 <https: curia.europa.eu="" juris="" liste.jsf?num="C-117/15"> (accessed 19 October 2021) at [49] that the profit-making nature of the broadcast of a protective work “does not determine conclusively” whether a transmission is to be categorised as a communication to the public under Art 3(1) of the EU Copyright Directive. The same principle was expressed in <span class="font-italic">ITV Broadcasting </span>at [43]. Both cases were affirmed in <span class="font-italic">TuneIn</span> at [70(14)] and [77] for this proposition.</https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  In this case, I prefer the view that the initial factor discussed at [87] outweighs the import of the commercial nature of the uplinked transmissions. That only <span class="font-italic">two</span> recipients in Singapore were able to decrypt the defendant’s satellite transmissions puts the latter’s uplinking activities beyond the realm of public communications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As the defendant’s satellite transmissions are not communicated to the public, even if the plaintiff has standing and I am wrong about the meanings of “broadcast” and “the making available of a work”, its claim for primary infringement of the right to communicate the Disputed Musical Works to the public fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For clarity, I accept that, in the abstract, the question of whether the defendant’s uplinking activities were communications to the public is a mixed question of law and fact. This issue, however, may be determined under O 14 r 12 of the ROC because all the relevant facts were undisputed. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Chem Orchid” and other appeals and another matter</span> [2016] 2 SLR 50 at [60] confirmed that summary determination under O 14 r 12 is suitable for points of law which can be determined on the basis of agreed or undisputed facts. Further, a useful illustration to distinguish questions of law and fact was set out by Andrew Ang J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Tsai Jean v Har </span><span class="font-italic">Mee Lee and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [16]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether a transaction is “not in good faith” can be described as a question of mixed fact and law. It is a question of fact where one has to make relevant findings of fact (<span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> good faith) and it is a question of law where one has to decide whether the findings of fact would constitute a lack of good faith in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Given the undisputed facts in this case, my analysis of whether the defendant’s uplinking activities constitute communications to the “public” falls into the latter category in Ang J’s illustration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether persons outside of Singapore form part of the “public” under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Finally, I address the plaintiff’s submission that persons outside of Singapore form part of the “public”. The plaintiff argues that because s 26 of the Copyright Act is adopted from s 31 of the Australian Act, the definition of “to the public” in s 10 of the Australian Act, which includes persons within and outside the territory, is instructive. Further, if the public is limited to persons within Singapore, there would be a loophole in the Copyright Act for communications originating from Singapore but which are only received outside of Singapore – the communicator may not be caught by the Copyright Act <span class="font-italic">or</span> the copyright law of the territory in which the communication is received.

Primarily, it points to the fact that the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004 released for public consultation expressly defined “communicate” to include making the work available to members of the public, whether inside or outside of Singapore. However, this provision was deleted from the bill that was eventually passed by Parliament (Leong and Chen’s Article at para 53).

</div> That Singapore did not adopt Australia’s extraterritorial definition of “to the public” in our Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2004 evinces Parliament’s intention to limit the ambit of the “public” to persons in Singapore. Even further still, the discussion on s 74(2) of the Copyright Act at [105]–[107] below shows that Parliament has used express language to give specific provisions extraterritorial reach. Therefore, the plaintiff’s point that <br/>s 10 of the Australian Act defines the “public” extraterritorially does not advance its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I also agree with the defendant that the loophole identified by the plaintiff is neither here nor there. To read the word “public” in s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) with an extraterritorial gloss will exceed the boundaries of what is permissible in statutory interpretation. The court would be adding to the language of a statutory provision to plug a perceived gap in the law, which is a <span class="font-italic">legislative</span> function (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Hung and others </span>[2018] 1 SLR 659 at [276]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Additionally, <span class="font-italic">Lance Court Furnishings Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> <br/>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 103 (“<span class="font-italic">Lance Court</span>”) underscores the impermissibility of giving a provision in the Copyright Act extraterritorial effect in the absence of express language. Anju/Woodridge Inc complained that Lance Court Furnishings Pte Ltd offered for sale fabric with designs infringing its copyrights (at [1]). Search warrants were issued under s 136(9) of the Copyright Act (1988 Rev Ed) in favour of Anju/Woodridge Inc. Lance Court Furnishings Pte Ltd then filed a criminal motion to set aside the search warrants. It referred to <br/>ss 74(2) and 74(3) of the Copyright Act (1988 Rev Ed) and submitted that if a design in which copyright subsists is applied industrially, and the design is not registered under the Registered Designs Act 1949 (c 88) (UK), then under <br/>s 74(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) “it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would have been within the scope of the copyright in the design if the design had, immediately before that time, been registered” (at [11]).

Kan Ting Chiu J rejected this submission. He held that the inclusion of the words “whether in Singapore or elsewhere” in s 74(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which dealt with sales and hire, and their absence in s 74(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) meant that industrial applications under the latter provision were limited to those in Singapore.

The intent of this amendment was to rectify the anomaly pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Lance Court</span>, such that the design copyright owner who industrially applies his work overseas is placed in no better position than his local counterpart who industrially applies his design in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(25 August 1994) vol 63 at col 415 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In summary, <span class="font-italic">Lance Court</span> fortifies my unwillingness to read the “public” in s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act extraterritorially in the absence of express language to that effect.

There were only two Distributors located in Singapore – Singtel and Starhub. Only one Encrypted Channel was transmitted by the defendant via satellite to the Distributors in Singapore – Fox Sports 3.

One such ground was that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue for primary infringement because it was not the exclusive licensee of the Underlying Rights in respect of the Disputed Musical Works (“the Standing Issue”). In response, the plaintiff argued that by virtue of reciprocal agreements (“the Disputed Reciprocal Agreements”) with two affiliated foreign collecting societies, it was the exclusive licensee of the Underlying Rights in respect of the Disputed Musical Works in Singapore. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">5 Subsequently, the plaintiff applied to determine two question of law under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in Summons No 5684 of 2020. The first question presented for summary determination was the Standing Issue. The second question was whether the defendant’s uplinking of Encrypted Channels that contained or featured the Disputed Musical Works by way of satellite transmission from Singapore constituted communication of the works to the public under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act (“the Communication Issue”). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">6 The following was the chain of events by which the Encrypted Channels (of which the Disputed Programmes were a part) were received by the Distributors’ subscribers:   </div><div class="txt-body text-left">a. First, the Encrypted Channels were uplinked to a satellite by the defendant from Singapore;</div><div class="txt-body text-left">b. Second, the signals were then downlinked (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, returned to Earth) to the Distributors in each country, including Singapore. Each Distributor was provided with a decoder device to decrypt the defendant’s signals at the downlinking site. </div><div class="txt-body text-left">c. The Distributors then transmitted the Encrypted Channels, received from the defendant, to their own subscribers who were located in the same country the Distributor was based in. Each Distributor was only authorised to distribute the channel(s) it received to its subscribers within the territory it was based in.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left">7 A “communication” under the Copyright Act may take the form of a broadcast or making the work available for access by any person at his convenience (s 7(1) of the Copyright Act). The particular issues that arose for determination under the second question were: </div><div class="txt-body text-left">a. What was the meaning of “broadcast” in s 7(1) of the Copyright Act?</div><div class="txt-body text-left">b. What was the meaning of “the making available of a work” in s 7(1) of the Copyright Act?</div><div class="txt-body text-left">c. What was the meaning of the “public” in s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Copyright Act?</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 The High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim for primary infringement under O 14 r 12 of the ROC and struck out the claim for authorisation liability under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">109] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[115].</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-underline">The claims for primary infringement</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">The Standing Issue</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 The court found that the plaintiff was not the exclusive licensee of the right to communicate the Disputed Musical Works to the public or to perform these works in public. Thus, it lacked standing to bring the claims for primary infringement (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[40]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 Under the Disputed Reciprocal Agreements, the plaintiff was only the exclusive licensee of the Rights of Authorisation in respect of the Disputed Musical Works (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[36]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 As s 9(2) of the Copyright Act referred separately to “the exclusive right to do an act in relation to a work” and “the exclusive right to authorise a person to do that act”, this signalled that the two rights were distinct (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">29]</span>). Although all Underlying Rights were accompanied by a corresponding Right of Authorisation, the two may be severed such as by way of an assignment or exclusive licence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 Further, being the owner or exclusive licensee of the Right of Authorisation did not necessarily imply the same over the Underlying Right. Section 25(1) of the Copyright Act made clear that a partial assignment of exclusive rights only transferred ownership of the exclusive rights which were the subject of the assignment. In keeping with the spirit of s 25(1) of the Copyright Act, rights obtained under an exclusive license were confined to the exclusive rights which were the subject-matter of the exclusive licence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[38]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">The Communication Issue</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The court found that the defendant’s satellite uplinking fell within the meaning of a PTP transmission. In PTP transmissions, one broadcaster transmitted signals to a satellite, which were then transmitted to another broadcaster who included the signals in its own transmissions. Indeed, in this case, the Encrypted Channels uplinked by the defendant were only downlinked to the Distributors. The Distributors were then responsible for transmitting the defendant’s channel(s) to their own subscribers (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[43]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 The court concluded that the Disputed Musical Works had not been communicated to the public under s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Copyright Act (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[108]</span>). There were three main planks to its reasoning.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 First, the court held that uplinking signals to a satellite in the context of PTP transmissions did not constitute a broadcast. This was because a broadcast must objectively involve direct transmission to the general public or a part thereof (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">16 The key reason relied on by the court in arriving at this interpretation of “broadcast” was the following contextual clue. Section 16(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Copyright Act stipulated the means for identifying who made a television or sound broadcast by “the technique known as direct broadcasting by satellite”, but not PTP transmissions. This suggested that Parliament did not consider PTP transmissions to be broadcasts under the Copyright Act. Further, the court was of the view that Singapore had adopted s 16(5) from the Copyright Act 1956 (c 74) (UK) (“Copyright Act 1956 (UK)”), as amended by the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (c 46) (UK) (“Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (UK)”). What was significant was that the UK Parliament had deliberately opted not to expand the definition of “broadcasting” in the Copyright Act 1956 (UK) to include PTP transmissions. Therefore, having incorporated s 14(10) of the Copyright Act 1956 (UK), as amended by the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 (UK), into Singapore’s statute books, the UK’s intention to <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> PTP transmissions from the ambit of “broadcasting” was likely also imported (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[58]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[62]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">17 Based on the foregoing, because the pleaded claim only accused the defendant of uplinking PTP transmissions, the Disputed Musical Works were not being broadcast by the defendant (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">18 Second, the court found that the defendant had not made the Disputed Musical Works available for access by any person from a place and at a time chosen by that person within the meaning of s 7(1) of the Copyright Act. This was because only the Distributors were able to decode the defendant’s encrypted transmissions (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">82]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">19 Third, even if the works had been communicated, they were not communicated to the “public” within the meaning of s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Copyright Act (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">99]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body text-left">20 The question of whether a communication had been made to the public was a multi-factorial inquiry (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[86]</span>). One factor was that the “public” ordinarily connoted “all members of the community or a section of the public. A substantial number of persons could sometimes be the “public” (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span>). Another factor was that if recipients of the communication were persons from whom the copyright owner was entitled to expect payment from, this weighed in favour of the communication having been made to the public (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[86]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">21 The defendant in this case performed its uplinking activities in a commercial setting. However, the court concluded that the commercial nature of the uplinked transmissions was outweighed by the fact that only two recipients in Singapore were able to decrypt them (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singtel and Starhub) (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[95]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[98]</span>). This number was too small to amount to a communication to the public (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[87]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">22 Further, Distributors outside of Singapore who received the defendant’s transmissions were irrelevant for the purpose of determining if a communication was made to the public. In the absence of express language in s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the court did not deem fit to give the word “public” an extraterritorial gloss (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[103]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">23 Both questions in the O 14 r 12 ROC application were resolved against the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claims for primary infringement were dismissed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[109]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-underline">The claim for authorisation liability</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left">24 Since the questions submitted for summary determination under <br/>O 14 r 12 of the ROC did not relate to authorisation liability, the court examined this portion of the claim under O 18 r 19 of the ROC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[111]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">25 The court struck out the claim for authorisation liability under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) for being legally unsustainable. To establish authorisation of an infringing act, there first must be proof that an infringing act had taken place within Singapore (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[11</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body text-left">26 However, the plaintiff did not even plead that the Distributors, particularly Singtel and Starhub, committed primary infringement. Therefore, even if the plaintiff succeeded in proving all the pleaded facts, the defendant could not be liable for authorising an act of infringement when the latter did not exist in the pleadings (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[114]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
