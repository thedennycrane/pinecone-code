It is the plaintiff’s case that the defendant signed a written agreement in April 2008 in which he undertook to settle MBIR’s debt by personally paying to the plaintiff US$600,000 and procuring the transfer to the plaintiff of a property in Russia valued at US$700,000.

</div> It is common ground that the defendant has not paid the plaintiff US$600,000 and has not procured the transfer of the Russian property to the plaintiff. The plaintiff therefore brings this action against the defendant to claim the liquidated sum of US$1.3m, alternatively damages to be assessed for breach of contract.

</div> This email bears the subject line “Minutes of meeting of 22nd Feb 2008”. The defendant begins the email by referring to an exchange of correspondence between the parties’ solicitors on 4 March 2008 before summarising the discussions at the February 2008 meeting. He confirms that the discussions resulted in a settled account between the parties showing US$1.3m owing by MBIR to the plaintiff. This sum is arrived at by taking into account the value of all goods supplied by the plaintiff to MBIR and deducting from that all of MBIR’s cross claims against the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendant concludes the email with an offer to procure a transfer of the Russian property to the plaintiff and personally to pay the plaintiff an additional sum of up to US$600,000 to resolve the parties’ claims and cross claims amicably:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… with a view to resolving the matter amicably, I as a director of MBIR, has already provided a security on his property in Russia to [the plaintiff] which is actually valued at USD900,000. As [the plaintiff] is aware, land in Russia cannot be owned by foreigners. Hence the legal owner of the land is Promfinaktiv, which is 100% owned by me and not MBIR. The land alone is more than sufficient as a security of any debts owed to [the plaintiff] by MBIR. However, as indicated in the meeting on 22 February 2008, I in my personal capacity as a director of MBIR is willing to pay [the plaintiff] a sum of up to US$600,000 from his own personal resources when such resources are available. My discussions with Lee Chee Tak and Mr. David Teo in respect of MBIR’s accounts with [the plaintiff] have been on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We trust that [the plaintiff] will view this issue practically. Any litigation proceedings will not be in the interest of any party. With my personal assurances, we trust that the matter can be resolved amicably without the necessity of bringing all issues before the court. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The defendant in this email introduces a Russian company called Promfinaktiv, a corporate vehicle owned and controlled by the defendant though which he holds the Russian property. The defendant explains in this email that, because Russian law does not allow foreigners to own Russian land, a transfer to the plaintiff of his shares in Promfinaktiv is the only way in which he can effect a transfer of the Russian property to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The parties met again on 2 April 2008.

It proceeds as follows. The defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement. He is therefore bound by it. He has failed to perform his obligations under it. He is therefore liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiff’s principal difficulty is evidential: it is unable to prove by direct evidence that the defendant signed the April 2008 written agreement.

In other words, even on the plaintiff’s case, Mr Lee did not see the defendant sign the written agreement and therefore cannot give direct evidence of that fact. All that the plaintiff is able to say is that the defendant returned the written agreement to the plaintiff, duly signed by the defendant, before end April 2008.

</div> The plaintiff relies on these emails as evidence that the parties had reached an oral agreement, the terms of which were then recorded in writing in the April 2008 written agreement.

But he did not protest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The third strand of circumstantial evidence is the defendant’s attempts, again without protest, to perform both of his obligations under the April 2008 agreement. Thus, the plaintiff submits that the five post-dated cheques totalling US$600,000 which the defendant issued in favour of the plaintiff in May 2008 (see [21] above) were issued in performance of the defendant’s obligation under the April 2008 agreement to pay the plaintiff US$600,000 by way of post-dated cheques. Likewise, the defendant’s efforts between April 2009 and April 2010 to transfer Promfinaktiv to the plaintiff – as evidenced by the emails exchanged during this period (see [23] above) – were efforts by the defendant to comply with his obligation under the April 2008 agreement to bring about a transfer of the Russian property to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff’s case is that it entered into an agreement in writing with the defendant in April 2008. The plaintiff commenced this action in March 2015, well over six years later. If the plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of the April 2008 agreement arose at any time before March 2009, being six years before the plaintiff commenced this action, the plaintiff’s action is time-barred by s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 To meet this defence, the plaintiff relies on the email sent by the defendant to Mr Lee on 4 April 2009 (described at [22(b)] above) as an acknowledgment by the defendant of the plaintiff’s claim in this action within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. The plaintiff’s case, therefore, is that its right of action against the defendant is deemed by s 26(2) to have accrued on 4 April 2009 and not before. The plaintiff commenced this action within six years of 4 April 2009 and it is therefore not time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendant’s account of events at and following the February 2008 meeting amounts to little more than a denial of the plaintiff’s account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The defendant denies that there was any discussion of MBIR’s debt to the plaintiff at the February 2008 meeting. The topic of discussion at the meeting was not how MBIR was going to repay its debt to the plaintiff. The topic of discussion, instead, was the problems which MBIR was facing in receiving the goods from the plaintiff and MBIR’s resulting set-offs and cross claims against the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>
</div> Considering that the defendant was presented with these five additional emails to be analysed on 8 March 2017, and given that a fresh report from Mr Pandey on them would have had the considerable advantage of building upon work Mr Pandey had already done for his initial report on the nine disputed emails, it appears to me that almost seven weeks was a sufficient period for Mr Pandey to analyse these five further emails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Quite apart from that, I also consider that this period of almost seven weeks was sufficient time for the defendant to secure at least a preliminary view from Mr Pandey whether there were any <span class="font-italic">additional</span> grounds for challenging these five additional emails over and above the grounds Mr Pandey had already identified and advanced for challenging the nine disputed emails in his initial report. Mr Pandey did not suggest any such additional grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Despite these findings, I do not shut the defendant out from challenging these five remaining emails. Because of my finding at [62] above, however, I proceed on the basis that the authenticity of these five additional emails stands or falls with the authenticity of the nine disputed emails which Mr Pandey did examine and analyse.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An analogy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The easiest way to conceptualise the parties’ cases on authenticity and to understand the experts’ reports is by drawing an analogy between an email and an ordinary letter, and to consider each disputed email as though it were instead a letter which the plaintiff alleges was sent by the sender to the recipient on or about the date which it bears. In the analogy which follows, I shall draw a distinction between an email’s human-readable contents and to its computer-readable contents. That distinction is something of an oversimplification: the truth of the matter is that an email in its original form is entirely and only computer-readable. What I mean, then, when I refer to human-readable contents are those contents of an email which a standard email client in ordinary usage renders human-readable when displaying an email either on the screen or in print. An email’s computer-readable contents, therefore, are those contents of an email which a standard email client in ordinary usage <span class="font-italic">does not</span> render human-readable when displaying an email either on the screen or in print.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On this analogy, the sender’s letter to the recipient is the analogue of the textual content of an email which is human-readable. The sender’s and the recipient’s street addresses recorded on the letter’s envelope are the analogues of the human-readable email address of the sender and the recipient of the email. The postal system is the analogue of the email system. The postmark and other sorting information imprinted on the envelope by the post offices through which the letter passes are the analogue of the computer-readable metadata attached automatically to each email as it is transmitted from server to server. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 What the plaintiff is seeking to do in this case is, by analogy, to adduce in evidence through Mr Lee and to rely upon a number of letters. The plaintiff asserts that the letters which appear on their face to originate from Mr Lee and to be addressed to the defendant were in fact written by Mr Lee and were in fact sent and delivered by the postal system to the defendant. The plaintiff asserts also that the letters which appear on their face to originate from the defendant and to be addressed to Mr Lee were in fact written by the defendant and were in fact delivered by the postal system to Mr Lee. Finally, the plaintiff asserts that all of these letters were in fact sent and received, on or about the dates indicated by the postmarks on the envelopes in which each letter was posted and received, on various dates between February 2008 and April 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Taking the analogy further, what the defendant asserts is that the plaintiff has fabricated all of these letters and that none of them were ever sent by the ostensible author or delivered to the ostensible recipient through the postal system, whether on the dates which they bear or otherwise. The plaintiff’s fabrication includes the contents of the letters, the signatures on them, the envelopes in which the plaintiff claims the letters were sent or received and the postmarks which the envelopes bear. The fabrication even encompasses the invisible computer-readable metadata in each email, for which there is no physical analogue in a letter. Thus, the defendant says, none of the disputed emails are capable of being evidence of anything.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 An inquiry into the authenticity of email correspondence is aided by a feature of email correspondence which has no analogue in analogue correspondence. Every email, in its original electronic form, has a computer-readable header created and attached to the email by the email system. Embedded in the email header is metadata, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> data about the data in the email. An email’s metadata includes data about, amongst other things: (a) the route which the email takes as it is relayed from server to server on its way to its addressee; and (b) a comprehensive set of time stamps. The information about the route is recorded in the header as a series of internet protocol (“IP”) addresses. The time stamps recorded in the header include the email’s “Creation Time”, “Submit Time”, “Delivery Time”, “Sent” and “Last Modification” time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 An email client will extract some – but crucially, not all – of the computer-readable metadata from the header and render it human-readable. Thus, the email address of the sender is automatically extracted from the metadata and rendered human readable by the recipient’s email client. But of the several time stamps recorded in the header, only the “Sent” time is rendered human-readable. And the routing information including the IP addresses are not rendered human-readable at all. The metadata in a particular email’s header which is not automatically rendered human-readable can be rendered human-readable and examined only by special tools. Further, this is possible only if one has access to the native, electronic version of the email. It is precisely this exercise which the parties’ respective information technology experts have undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Three possibilities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The issue of authenticity is not only an anterior evidential issue. The finding on authenticity, one way or the other, has far-reaching ramifications for the credibility of the parties’ witnesses and their respective cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I take as my starting point the fact that amnesia on either side can be discounted. I consider the chances that Mr Lee and the defendant could have sent and received so many emails which are so critical to the issues in question in this action and have forgotten all about all of them, even after a lapse of almost a decade, are so fanciful that they can be safely disregarded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The manner in which the parties have presented their respective cases on authenticity to me therefore leaves one of only three possible conclusions open to me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The first possible conclusion is that the emails are genuine. If so, all of the information set out in the emails’ human-readable and the computer-readable contents can be taken at face value. It follows from this conclusion that: (a) each email was composed by its ostensible author and submitted to the email system from his email address; (b) the email system delivered each email to its ostensible recipient at his email address; and (c) the header records accurately the date and time at which the email was so submitted and delivered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This conclusion leads to a finding that Mr Lee’s evidence is the truth and the defendant’s denials are false. But the result of this conclusion goes much further than that. Amnesia having been discounted, this conclusion excludes the possibility that the defendant is an honest but mistaken witness. Of necessity, this conclusion dictates that the defendant did write and receive the emails at or about the time they each bear, that he knows that he did, and that he is deceiving the court when he claims that he did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The second possible conclusion is that the emails are fabrications. If so, none of the emails – whether in the human-readable or in the computer-readable contents – is capable of being evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 This conclusion leads to a finding that Mr Lee’s evidence is false and that the defendant’s evidence is the truth. But, once again – amnesia having been discounted – it cannot be that the disbelieved witness is honest but mistaken. Mr Lee must know that he has perjured himself by testifying that he sent and received these emails between February 2008 and April 2010. Further, because Mr Lee is presenting these emails to the court as authentic with knowledge that they are not, he must either have fabricated these emails himself or been complicit in their fabrication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The final possible conclusion is an intermediate position. On this alternative, Mr Lee did: (a) send the emails which originated from him on the dates and times indicated on their face; and (b) did receive responses to them at or around the same time. But, unknown to him, he was corresponding with a third party who was impersonating the defendant. This conclusion leads to a finding that both Mr Lee and the defendant are honest witnesses and posits a third party who, through electronic trickery, impersonated the defendant electronically between 2008 and 2010 and made it appear to Mr Lee that the defendant was his correspondent. This possibility was referred to at trial as “spoofing”. Emails can be spoofed without access to the computer of the ostensible sender and even without access to his email account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 But some of the disputed emails originated from Mr Lee and were addressed to the defendant. So, this conclusion also leads to a finding that the third party had access to the defendant’s computer, or at the very least to his email account, so as to intercept Mr Lee’s emails and ensure that the defendant would never receive them. Further, the third party would have had to have intercepted and diverted <span class="font-italic">only</span> Mr Lee’s emails to the defendant in order to avoid arousing the defendant’s suspicions by preventing <span class="font-italic">all</span> of his incoming emails from getting through.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I now turn to consider the experts’ evidence on authenticity. The key difficulty in this case is that there are discrepancies in the IP addresses and time stamps recorded in each email header. The experts draw differing conclusions from the discrepancies. It is Mr Pandey who points out the discrepancies and Mr Fazelinasab who attempts to explain them. It is therefore convenient to start with Mr Pandey’s evidence. I am conscious throughout, however, that the burden of proof on the issue of authenticity rests on the plaintiff, and on the plaintiff alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I now consider each expert’s evidence in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendant’s expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant’s expert, Mr Pandey, accepts that the “Submit Time” and “Delivery Time” recorded in the header of each email shows that each email was delivered to the recipient within a second of being submitted by the sender.

Section 62(1) of the Evidence Act is of no assistance because the headers are neither oral evidence nor direct evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Presumption of regularity for electronic records</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The plaintiff relies on the presumption in s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act. That provision, for present purposes, entitles the court to presume that an electronic record has been produced accurately on a given occasion if that electronic record is produced by a device which, if properly used, ordinarily produces an electronic record. The presumption created by s 116A(1) is not, of course, absolute. It is rebutted if sufficient evidence is adduced to raise doubt about the presumption. The provision and its accompanying illustration are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumptions in relation to electronic records</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116A.―(1) Unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is adduced, where a device or process is one that, or is of a kind that, if properly used, ordinarily produces or accurately communicates an electronic record, the court shall presume that in producing or communicating that electronic record on the occasion in question, the device or process produced or accurately communicated the electronic record.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">A</span> seeks to adduce evidence in the form of an electronic record or document produced by an electronic device or process. <span class="font-italic">A</span> proves that the electronic device or process in question is one that, or is of a kind that, if properly used, ordinarily produces that electronic record or document.

I therefore have to consider two questions. First, has the plaintiff discharged its burden to bring these electronic records within s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act? If so, the rebuttable presumption applies <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>. The next question then arises: has the defendant adduced “evidence sufficient to raise a doubt about the presumption”?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Has the plaintiff brought these electronic records within s 116A(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to bring these electronic records within s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Both of the defendant’s arguments miss the point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The first argument misses the point because it does not address the focus of the first question which arises under s 116A(1). The first question is whether the plaintiff has discharged its burden to bring these electronic records within s 116A(1). Adapting the language of s 116A(1) to the facts of this case, that requires only that the plaintiff show that the device (a personal computer) or a process (email) is of a kind which, if properly used, ordinarily produces an electronic record. The electronic records which the plaintiff wishes to rely upon are the email headers which contain metadata recording, amongst other things, the date and time on which the defendant sent a disputed email to Mr Lee and the date and time on which Mr Lee sent a disputed email to the defendant’s email address. The question now is whether a personal computer and the email process ordinarily creates email headers. The defendant’s point about the email migration has nothing to do with that question. Within the rubric of s 116A(1), this point should properly be raised when analysing whether the presumption is rebutted, not when analysing whether the presumption arises at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The defendant’s second argument too misses the point. It is risible to suggest that a person who prints an email ought to be called as a witness before that email becomes admissible under s 116A(1). The legislative purpose of s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act is to facilitate the use of electronic records as forensic evidence (<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit</span><span class="font-italic"> Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuan, third party)</span> [2015] 1 SLR 338 (“<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific Group</span>”) at [250]). In the case of an email, the electronic record is not the human-readable contents of the email in printed form. The electronic record is the computer-readable version of the email in its original electronic form. If an electronic record comes within the scope of s 116A(1), rendering that electronic record human-readable by using a standard email client to print it on paper does not create new evidence for which a new test of admissibility needs to be applied. The printed version does nothing more than set out the electronic record in human-readable form. It is not suggested that the printed versions are in any way inaccurate renditions of the human readable contents of the emails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Applying s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act to the facts before me, I am satisfied that the presumption operates in the plaintiff’s favour. I note that the provision was intended to avoid requiring the person who relies on the electronic record to have detailed technical knowledge of the process behind its production. Therefore, for the presumption to apply, it suffices that that person has a broad understanding of the process (<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pac</span><span class="font-italic">ific Group</span> at [255]). Mr Lee’s evidence as the lay operator of his email system (the process), comprising both his personal computer (the hardware) and the email client (the software), suffices to satisfy me that the device or process in question which produced the disputed electronic records in his email inbox or sent folder was one which ordinarily produces electronic records. That is virtually axiomatic. The presumption arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 With the presumption in place, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that the presumption should not apply. The defendant has failed to do this. Although Mr Pandey suggested a number of discrepancies with the headers of the disputed emails, this is insufficient to tilt the balance in the defendant’s favour for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Mr Fazelinasab opines that the discrepancies with the header identified by Mr Pandey are explained by the email migration which took place in December 2012 (see [87] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, Mr Pandey accepts that the headers indicate that an email migration did take place. But even though he was aware that a migration could have taken place, he <span class="font-italic">did not</span> take into account the possibility of a migration affecting the header when preparing his report.

Indeed, the concession from Mr Pandey that his evidence does not go so far as to opine that the emails are fabricated or spoofed underscores the defendant’s inability to rebut the presumption under s 116A(1) of the Evidence Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I also discount the defendant’s objection that the plaintiff has failed to call a representative of the external information technology contractor who handled the plaintiff’s email migration in December 2012 to give direct evidence as to the actual process which took place. I accept that Mr Lee’s direct evidence as to the migration is sufficient. Mr Lee testified that he personally sent and received the disputed emails and that they were initially saved on the plaintiff’s servers. Mr Lee testified that these emails were migrated to Google’s servers in December 2012.

</div> Mr Lee testified that, for the purposes of this litigation, the disputed emails were simply retrieved from the inbox on his personal computer without having their contents modified. I am conscious that this was not Mr Lee’s initial evidence. Mr Lee initially testified that he downloaded the emails from the plaintiff’s email server into his computer’s inbox with the help of Mr Ng Keng Feong, the plaintiff’s information technology executive.

</div> This is not correct. An allegation of forgery amounts to an allegation of fraud. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 at [183]–[184], the standard of proof in all civil cases – even when fraud is alleged – is proof on the balance of probabilities, nothing higher. The law does not require a party to a civil case who alleges fraud to adduce <span class="font-italic">more</span> evidence in order to tip the balance of probabilities in his favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 It is true, however, that the law acknowledges that, on the probabilities inherent in the general course of human experience, the more serious an allegation is, the less likely it is that the allegation is true. That is why the law require a person alleging fraud to adduce <span class="font-italic">stronger</span> or more <span class="font-italic">cogent</span> evidence of fraud to discharge his burden than a person alleging, for example, negligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 <span class="font-italic">In re H and other (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span> [1996] 1 AC 563 (at 586D), Lord Nicholls examined, albeit in the different context of family law proceedings, the interaction between the seriousness of an allegation in a civil case and the standard of proof resting on the party making the allegation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not. When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fraud is usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury. A stepfather is usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his underage stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her. Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability its occurrence will be established. Ungoed-Thomas J expressed this neatly in <span class="font-italic">In re Dellow’s Will Trusts </span>[1964] 1 WLR 451, 455: ‘The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This approach also provides a means by which the balance of probability standard can accommodate one’s instinctive feeling that even in civil proceedings a court should be more sure before finding serious allegations proved than when deciding less serious or trivial matters.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings on forgery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 After considering the evidence before me, I find that the defendant has failed to discharge his burden of proving on the balance of probabilities that the signature on the April 2008 written agreement is a forgery.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preliminary evidential points</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As a preliminary point, I note that the defendant takes issue with the plaintiff’s evidence on the April 2008 written agreement itself.

</div> That evidence, if accepted, suffices in itself to prove Mr Teo’s signature without any need for Mr Teo himself to testify. In any event, the defendant has not put the authenticity of Mr Teo’s signature in issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 On the defendant’s second submission, the order in which each party signed the April 2008 written agreement is irrelevant to the only point now in issue, which is whether the defendant’s signature is genuine. Any uncertainty about the sequence in which the parties signed the April 2008 written agreement can go, at best, only to Mr Lee’s credibility as a witness and not to the merits of the plaintiff’s case.  But even on credibility, any small detraction from Mr Lee’s credibility cannot overcome the mortal wound to the defendant’s credibility by my finding that he has attempted knowingly to deceive the court by falsely characterising the disputed emails as fabrications when they are in fact genuine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 On the defendant’s third submission, it is true that the plaintiff has offered no explanation for the August 2011 date stamp appearing on the original April 2008 written agreement. Ultimately, however, that is also irrelevant to the question of whether the defendant’s signature is genuine. As counsel for the defendant concedes, even if I were to find that Mr Teo signed the April 2008 written agreement only in August 2011, the defendant would nevertheless be bound by the agreement if I were also to find that his signature on it is genuine.

This strongly suggests that the steps which the defendant eventually took to transfer the Russian property to the plaintiff were ultimately referable to MBIR’s debt to the plaintiff and not to any alleged joint venture packaging operation. The draft undertaking undercuts the defendant’s contention that his attempts to transfer Promfinaktiv to the plaintiff were unconnected to MBIR’s debt to the plaintiff and hence unconnected to the April 2008 agreement. When the defendant was confronted with the draft undertaking in cross-examination, he was at a loss for words. His response was only to complain that it is difficult to do business in Russia.

</div> Expecting some documentary evidence is not asking too much. These additional 20 to 25 cheques are the defendant’s own cheques drawn on his own bank. They ought to be easily available to the defendant, if they exist. Equally, there ought to be some documentary evidence available to the defendant of the underlying transactions to which these cheques are said to be referable either directly, from his own or MBIR’s records, or indirectly, through discovery from the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Second, in a bid to show that these five cheques have nothing to do with the April 2008 agreement, the defendant explains that he countermanded the cheques because MBIR did not receive the goods in question from the plaintiff because they were blocked at Russian customs after a counterfeit claim was filed against them.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I do not accept this evidence either. It is, to my mind, too much of a coincidence that the April 2008 agreement obliged the defendant to issue post-dated cheques totalling US$600,000 in favour of the defendant and that the defendant did precisely that shortly after, in April or May 2008. It is true that the April 2008 agreement required the defendant to issue <span class="font-italic">two</span> post-dated cheques totalling US$600,000 instead of <span class="font-italic">five</span> post-dated cheques totalling US$600,000. But the fact remains that these five cheques add up to US$600,000 as stipulated in the April 2008 agreement, and there is no evidence to support the defendant’s contention that he issued the cheques pursuant to another agreement or transaction. On the contrary, the only evidence showing that goods were blocked at customs pursuant to a counterfeit claim is a diplomatic note dated 28 December 2007. That is dated long before the defendant issued the five cheques, let alone his countermand of them.

</div> The defendant is correct that this action is time-barred if (but only if) the plaintiff’s cause of action accrued before March 2009. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The defendant’s case on limitation assumes that the plaintiff’s cause of action on the April 2008 agreement accrued in April 2008. Taking that view implies that the April 2008 agreement required the defendant to carry out his obligations immediately and that he was in breach of contract as soon as he signed it. In fact, the agreement is silent on the time frame within which the defendant is obliged to perform his obligations. Indeed, the fact that the defendant delivered and the plaintiff accepted the post-dated cheques and took time to procure the transfer of Promfinaktiv to the defendant suggests that neither party considered the defendant’s performance obligation to be immediate. And so it must be an implied term of the April 2008 agreement that the defendant should perform his obligations within a reasonable period after April 2008. I assume in the defendant’s favour that that reasonable period expired before March 2009, such that the plaintiff’s action was commenced more than six years after the defendant breached the April 2008 agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In response, the plaintiff argues that the 4 April 2009 email amounts to an acknowledgement within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. It submits that its cause of action therefore accrued on 4 April 2009, and that its action is not time-barred because the plaintiff commenced action before 4 April 2015.

It is a well-established procedural rule that a defendant cannot avail himself of a limitation defence unless he raises it by an express plea. It is therefore necessary to analyse the defendant’s express limitation plea in order to understand the scope of the limitation defence as pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The pleadings in this action comprise only a statement of claim and a defence. There is no counterclaim and the plaintiff did not file a reply. The plaintiff’s principal claim is for the liquidated sum of US$1.3m. Its alternative claim is for unliquidated damages for breach of contract. The issue with the defendant’s limitation plea arises because only the plaintiff’s primary claim is a claim “to recover [a] debt or liquidated pecuniary claim” to which s 26(2) applies. Section 26(2) does not apply to the plaintiff’s alternative claim for unliquidated damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 On the pleadings, unusually, it was the plaintiff who took the initiative to raise the limitation issue, albeit obliquely. Its statement of claim expressly and pre-emptively pleads that the defendant’s 4 April 2009 email “acknowledged the debt owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff”

In that case, the Court of Appeal held at [93] that an acknowledgment need only admit that a debt remains due. It is not necessary for the acknowledgment to state the amount that is due as long as the amount can be ascertained by reference to extrinsic evidence. Further, the statement which is alleged to be an acknowledgment must be seen and construed in context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Contrary to the defendant’s contention,

</div> therefore, the test for whether a statement amounts to an acknowledgement within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act is not a strict one.

The defendant thus acknowledged his obligations to the plaintiff under the April 2008 agreement, at least a part of which was to pay the plaintiff a liquidated sum of US$600,000. That liquidated sum, though not mentioned in the 4 April 2009 email, is readily ascertainable by reference to the terms of the April 2008 written agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The defendant’s acknowledgement is made even clearer when one considers that the 4 April 2009 email was the defendant’s response to an email from Mr Lee, which refers to an “agreement to settle the outstanding account between [the parties]”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject: Our Agreement dated 2/04/2008</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dear Mr. kartik,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We <span class="font-italic">refer to said agreement to settle the outstanding account</span> between our companies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unfortunately, we are still not able to resolve this matter though we have been given you varies [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] settlement options over the year upon your requests.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hence, kindly take notice that we will not hesitate to commence the necessary legal action to recover the FULL amount owing by MBI Russia Pte Ltd if we do not receive any satisfactory final settlement proposal from you by 7/04/2009.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Please feel free to contact us should you require any further clarification.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thanks and regards,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lee Chee Tak</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The defendant argues that the 4 April 2009 email does not constitute an acknowledgement for a number of reasons. First, he points out that the email from Mr Lee to which it responds refers to an agreement “between our companies”. He argues that Mr Lee was thus referring to an agreement between the plaintiff and MBIR, and not to an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant personally.

</div> Therefore, the only plausible reading of Mr Lee’s email is that he was referring to the April 2008 agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant personally. In my view, the word “companies” here signifies no more than the very common conflation of an individual with a company of which he is the principal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Second, the defendant points out that the body of the 4 April 2009 email does not contain an express reference to the April 2008 agreement. He argues that the only reference to the 2 April 2008 agreement is in the subject line of the email (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“Re: Our Agreement dated 2/04/2008”), which is insufficient to constitute an acknowledgement of the debt because the text of the subject line originated from Mr Lee. All that the defendant did was to leave the subject line unchanged when he replied on 4 April 2009.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The defendant’s first contention is misconceived. The point is not that the reference to the 2 April 2008 agreement originated from the defendant, but that the defendant in his response on 4 April 2009 neither changed the subject line which originated from Mr Lee nor rejected Mr Lee’s suggestion that there was such an agreement. Instead, he merely told Mr Lee that he “plan[ned] to amicably settle with [the plaintiff]”. Read together with the subject of the email, the defendant did acknowledge his obligation under the April 2008 agreement, at least part of which was to pay a liquidated sum of US$600,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The defendant’s second contention is also misconceived. The April 2008 written agreement is titled “Record of agreement by parties at a meeting held on <span class="font-italic">2nd April 2008</span> at 3:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m., at No. 2 Senoko South Road, Super Industrial Building, Singapore 038987” [emphasis added].

</div> And relying on the English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Good v Parry </span>[1963] 2 All ER 59, the defendant argues that such a statement is not an acknowledgement within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act.

</div>
</div> But <span class="font-italic">Good v Parry</span> does not stand for the proposition alleged by the defendant. As will be seen, it stands for the proposition that an acknowledgement must contain an admission that a debt of an ascertainable quantum <span class="font-italic">exist</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 In <span class="font-italic">Good v Parry</span>, a landlord brought an action against a tenant for rent. The tenant argued that the action was time-barred under s 2 of the English Limitation Act 1939 (c 21) because the cause of action for arrears of rent accrued more than six years before the action was commenced. In response, the landlord adduced a letter which he claimed operated as an acknowledgement sufficient to extend the time within which he could bring the action. The salient portion of the letter stated as follows: “The question of outstanding rent can be settled as a separate agreement as soon you present your account” (<span class="font-italic">Good v Parry</span> at 60).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The English Court of Appeal held that the letter did not constitute an acknowledgement. Lord Denning MR observed that an acknowledgment must be in relation to a quantified debt or to a debt that can be ascertained by calculation or extrinsic evidence without further agreement (<span class="font-italic">Good v Parry </span>at 61). He held that the statement fell short of an acknowledgement because there was no admission of any debt that was defined or ascertainable by calculation (<span class="font-italic">Good v Parry </span>at 62). Danckwerts LJ agreed, noting that the letter merely admitted the <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> of a claim, but not that a debt existed (<span class="font-italic">Good v Parry </span>at 62). Similarly, Davies LJ held that the letter did not acknowledge the existence of a claim, but that there <span class="font-italic">might </span>be one (<span class="font-italic">Good v Parry</span> at 62).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 It is thus apparent that <span class="font-italic">Good v Parry</span> merely requires an acknowledgement to admit a debt, the quantum of which is either defined or capable of ascertainment by extrinsic evidence (David W Oughton, John P Lowry &amp; Robert M Merkin, <span class="font-italic">Limitation of Actions </span>(LLP Reference Publishing, 1998) at p 153). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 On the facts, the quantum of the plaintiff’s liquidated pecuniary claim against the defendant, which was acknowledged by the defendant, can be easily ascertained by reference to the April 2008 written agreement as amounting to US$600,000. Accordingly, I find that the 4 April 2009 email is an acknowledgment within the meaning of s 26(2) of the Limitation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In light of the defendant’s failure to raise an express plea that an acknowledgement within s 26(2) of the Act does not suffice to defeat the plaintiff’s alternative unliquidated claim, that finding suffices to defeat the defendant’s limitation defence to both the plaintiff’s primary claim as well as to the plaintiff’s alternative claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The plaintiff’s action is therefore not time-barred. It was commenced by the plaintiff within six years of the acknowledgment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before 4 April 2015. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 For the foregoing reasons, I find to be authentic: (a) all of the emails relied upon by the plaintiff; and (b) the defendant’s signature on the April 2008 agreement. I also find that the plaintiff’s action is not time-barred. Accordingly, I find liability in this action in the plaintiff’s favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Further, although this action is bifurcated, the plaintiff has established in this phase of the proceedings that the defendant owes the plaintiff the liquidated sum of US$600,000. On that aspect of the plaintiff’s claim, there are no damages to be assessed. I have therefore ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the sum of US$600,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 24 March 2015 to 14 August 2017; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) damages for his failure to transfer the Russian property to the plaintiff, with such damages to be assessed by the court; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the costs of and incidental to this phase of this action, with such costs to be taxed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Because the defendant’s liability to the plaintiff under the April 2008 agreement arises from the same underlying debt as MBIR’s judgment debt to the plaintiff, there is at least a possibility of double recovery. Given that MBIR is defunct, (see [27] above), that possibility is fanciful and theoretical in the extreme. Nevertheless, to eliminate any prospect of double recovery, the plaintiff has undertaken to the court to give credit to the defendant for any sums which the plaintiff recovers from MBIR against the defendant’s liability to the plaintiff under the judgment in this action. That undertaking is a sufficient measure to eliminate even a theoretical risk of double recovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Bryan Ghows and Ahmad Firdaus Daud (Taylor Vinters Via LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Edmond Pereira and Goh Chui Ling (Edmond Pereira Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
