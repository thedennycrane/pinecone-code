<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff-husband is 74 years old while the
                    defendant-wife is 72 years old.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> They were married on 29 March 1977.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was a marriage of 34 years. Arising from this
                    marriage, they have one son, Chan Vi Chaya (Chen Weicai), who is 36 years
                        old.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He is a veterinarian working in Hong
                        Kong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The wife is claiming a fair and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial assets. She is also asking for lump sum maintenance.
                    The husband, on the other hand, refuses to give her a share of the matrimonial
                    assets. He also does not wish to pay her any maintenance. The husband’s
                    main reason for objecting to the wife’s claims is that she had previously
                    tried to kill him by poisoning him with arsenic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Divorce proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 15 April 2011, the husband filed for
                        divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The wife, on the other hand, filed a
                    counterclaim alleging the husband’s unreasonable behaviour as a ground for
                        divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The husband’s ground for divorce is that
                    sometime in 2004, the wife started to poison him with arsenic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 27 May 2010, the wife was sentenced
                    to one year’s imprisonment for causing hurt to the husband by adding
                    arsenic, in the form of insecticide, into his tea and food, an offence under s
                    328 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Consequently, the husband suffered from arsenic poisoning which caused him to
                    suffer from anaemia and liver cirrhosis, as noted by Choo Han Teck J in
                        <em>Fong Quay Sim v Public Prosecutor and other
                        matters</em> [2011] SGHC 187 at [18].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The wife’s counterclaim was on the basis
                    that the husband had neglected her and had also verbally abused her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> She was diagnosed to have
                    suffered from a long history of chronic spousal emotional and verbal
                        abuse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Her
                    unhappiness with the husband led her to poison him so as to get back at
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 15 December 2011, the Family Court granted an
                    interim judgment of divorce to both the husband and wife on their claim and
                    counterclaim respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For the division of matrimonial assets, I shall
                    first identify the operative legal principles that are germane to this case.
                    Thereafter, I shall discuss the facts together with these axiomatic
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Just and equitable principle is the bedrock for the division of
                matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap
                    353, 2009 Rev Ed) prescribes the just and equitable principle applicable in the
                    division of matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112(1).    The court shall have power, when granting or
                            subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or
                            nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any
                            matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between
                            the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such
                            proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 112(2) of the Women’s Charter also lists a
                        number of non-exhaustive factors that the court has to take into account in
                        the division of matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112(2). It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise
                        its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard
                        to all the circumstances of the case, including the following
                        matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party

                            giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the
                            carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far
                            as they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Broad brush approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It has been accepted that the court should adopt
                    a broad-brush approach in the division of matrimonial assets. In <em>NI v NJ</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75, V K Rajah J (as he then was)
                    held at [18] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The division of matrimonial assets is a subject to be approached with a
                        certain latitude; it calls for the application of sound discretion rather
                        than a purely rigid or mathematical formula. All relevant circumstances
                        should be assessed objectively and holistically. Generally speaking,
                        however, when a marriage ends a wife is entitled to an equitable share of
                        the assets she has helped to acquire directly or indirectly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The non-mathematical nature of the enquiry is
                    consistent with the broad-brush approach to the division of matrimonial assets.
                    The Court of Appeal in <em>BCB v BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324
                    at [10] has recently reaffirmed the broad-brush approach to give the court the
                    flexibility to pursue a just and equitable outcome:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The broad-brush approach is particularly apposite because, in the nature
                        of things, an approach that is rooted in the forensic search for the actual
                        financial contributions of the parties towards the acquisition of the assets
                        will inevitably fail to adequately value the indirect contributions made
                        towards the other expenses that are incurred in the course of raising a
                        family and will also be a heavily fact-centric exercise. Moreover, these
                        facts will typically not be borne out by contemporaneous records, as
                        underscored by the court in <em>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon
                            Yock</em> [1998] SGHC 204 at [6] (cited by this court in <em>NK v NL</em>, as quoted above at [8] of this judgment).
                        The broad-based approach also avoids what this court has described as an
                        otherwise fruitless "mechanistic accounting procedure reflected in the form
                        of an arid and bloodless balance sheet" that "would be contrary to the
                        letter and spirit of the legislative scheme" underlying s 112 (see <em>NK v NL</em> at [36], an observation which was most
                        recently referred to by this court in <em>AYQ v
                            AYR</em> [2013] 1 SLR 476 (“<em>AYQ</em>”) at [18]). Indeed, such a broad yet principled
                        approach enables us to strike a balance between the search for a just and
                        principled outcome in each case and the need to remain sensitive to the
                        nuances of each fact situation we are confronted with. We pause to note
                        – parenthetically – that this is why the Singapore courts have
                        avoided extreme points of departure. For example, this court has held that
                        there is no starting point, presumption or norm of an equal division of
                        matrimonial assets, a holding that is wholly consistent with the legislative
                        background which resulted in s 112 and its concomitant broad-brush approach
                        (see, for example, the decision of this court in <em>Lock
                            Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 at
                        [50]–[58]). Another example – to be considered in a moment
                        – is the fact that the court will take into account <em>both</em> direct <em>as well as</em>
                        indirect contributions by <em>both</em> parties to the
                        marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The courts have always acknowledged the
                    importance of indirect contributions of the parties, which originates from the
                    wife in a vast majority of cases, when considering the division of matrimonial
                    assets. The Court of Appeal, in <em>AYQ v AYR and another
                        matter</em> [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [23], held that indirect contributions
                    should be quantified with the full benefit of hindsight, and in a broad manner
                    that does not narrowly focus on specific classes of assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The court's assessment of a spouse's indirect contribution should thus
                        be performed with retrospective lenses, looking back and fully appreciating
                        the entire context and circumstances of the marriage. It should not be done
                        in a time-specific manner, <em>ie</em>, assessing the
                        extent of indirect contributions of a spouse as at that specific point in
                        time when a particular matrimonial asset was acquired. Further, this
                        assessment should not be done in a blinkered fashion where the court focuses
                        on each individual class of assets and decides the weightage of a spouse's
                        indirect contribution as regards that particular asset class, resulting in a
                        situation where varying weights are accorded for indirect contributions in
                        different matrimonial asset classes. This approach would accord with the
                        view of the marital enterprise being a partnership of efforts of both
                        spouses and that, during the course of marriage, the spouses contribute to
                        the betterment of it in ways that they can without consciously accounting
                        with mathematical precision as regards the quantum and type of their
                        respective contributions. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I agree with the above observations. As I have stated in
                            <em>BMJ v BMK</em> [2014] SGHC 14 at
                    [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Marriage is a unique marital partnership in which parties do not
                        indulge in “accounting with mathematical precision” during the
                        blissful period of their marriage. Marriage is a joint enterprise; indirect
                        contributions should not be filtered through a fine-toothed comb and must be
                        looked at in a broad manner in order to derive a just and equitable
                        outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the broad-brush approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The broad-brush approach requires the court to
                    take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the direct
                    and indirect contributions of both parties. In this case, it is not disputed
                    that the husband made significant direct contributions towards the acquisition
                    of the matrimonial assets in the course of their 34-year marriage. The
                    properties were purchased and sold by the husband. The wife did not contribute
                    directly to the purchase of the matrimonial properties. However, the wife did
                    contribute financially in other aspects such as towards the education of their
                    son. The wife also made significant non-financial contributions towards the
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband was the sole breadwinner of the
                    family. He was a contractor and had provided financially for the
                        family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He gave $500 per month to the wife as

                    family’s expenses. He also paid for the son’s education until the
                    son graduated from Singapore Polytechnic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The husband spent most of his time on his work
                    as a contractor. He said he would spend time with the family on weekends and
                    major public holidays.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The wife was a full-time housewife looking
                    after the family which includes the son and the husband. In 1993, the wife
                    received an inheritance of $80,000 from her late mother. This was used to pay
                    for the son’s extra expenses such as book costs, transportation costs and
                    fees for extra-curricular activities while the son was in Singapore Polytechnic
                    and when he was serving National Service.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    The wife’s late mother had also given the wife an allowance of $500 per
                    month until her death in 1993. Part of the allowance received was also used for
                    the son’s expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The wife’s late brother left her a sum
                    of DM309,071 in 1995. She used this inheritance to pay for the son’s
                    tertiary education in Glasgow University, United Kingdom, where he pursued a
                    degree in veterinarian medicine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    The wife also received an inheritance of $208,003 from her late brother’s
                    estate in 1995. She used this to pay for personal and household expenses from
                    1995 to 2005. The household expenses paid for by the wife include utilities
                    bills, phone bills, property tax, maid salary and levy, <em>etc</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The wife made significant indirect
                    non-financial contributions during the marriage. It is evident that the
                    wife’s indirect contributions far outweigh the husband’s indirect
                    non-financial contributions. She was a full-time housewife and she was the
                    primary caregiver of the family. She also assisted the husband in his business
                    as he is illiterate although this was disputed by the husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> She also helped him seek financial support from
                    her mother and family members when he was in need of financial aid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Despite her efforts, the
                    husband treated her badly. She was emotionally abused during the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Should the wife’s misconduct of hurting
                    her husband with arsenic be considered when deciding on a just and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial assets? The husband argued that the indirect
                    contributions of the wife should be negated by her attempt to murder him with
                    insecticide such that she should not obtain a share of the matrimonial assets at
                        all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The husband also argued that even if
                    she is to obtain a share, it should be substantially reduced to reflect the
                    court’s disapproval of her conduct.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    Before I address the husband’s arguments, I would first like to correct
                    the husband’s submission that the wife attempted to murder him. Factually,
                    the wife was not charged for attempted murder but for an offence under s 328 of
                    the Penal Code for causing hurt to her husband using arsenic. Therefore, the
                    misconduct in question was the wife’s poisoning of the husband that caused
                    him physical harm and not any attempt to murder the husband. With the correction
                    of this erroneous fact, I now proceed to deal with the husband’s
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The list of considerations in s 112(2) of the
                    Women’s Charter does not include the misconduct of a party. This list is
                    not exhaustive and s 112(2) requires the court “to have regard to
                    all the circumstances of the case”, which will include any misconduct.
                    However, while considering all the circumstances of this case, the court must
                    bear in mind that the enquiry is focussed upon the direct and indirect
                    contributions of both spouses so as to reach a just and equitable division of
                    matrimonial assets. As stated by Andrew Phang JA in <em>NK v
                        NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<em>NK v
                        NL</em>”) at [20]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The division of matrimonial assets under the [Women’s Charter]
                        is founded on the prevailing ideology of marriage as an equal co-operative
                        partnership of efforts. The contributions of both spouses are equally
                        recognised whether he or she concentrates on the economics or homemaking
                        roles, as both roles must be performed equally well if the marriage is to
                        flourish. When the marriage breaks up, these contributions are translated
                        into economic assets in the distribution according to s 112(2) of the
                        [Women’s Charter]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Therefore, I agree with the learned author of
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 11
                    (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue, 2006) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at para 130.833 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... This factor [the misconduct of either spouse] should be used
                        judiciously if the assessment of just and equitable proportions is not to
                        become distorted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is not the case that any act of misconduct
                    of either spouse would give rise to a reduction in his or her share of the
                    matrimonial assets. A hearing for the division of matrimonial assets is not
                    another forum for divorced spouses to dredge up petty disputes relating to each
                    other’s conduct. In <em>Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau
                        Poo</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545, the former husband had an adulterous
                    relationship with another woman for half of the duration of the marriage. The
                    Court of Appeal, nonetheless, did not give much consideration to this misconduct
                    when dealing with the division of matrimonial assets: see also <em>Halsbury’s</em> at para 130.833, fn 7. In my opinion,
                    there must be some nexus between the misconduct and the contributions of either
                    spouse which is the focus of the court’s enquiry when deciding on the
                    division of matrimonial assets. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> at [11]–[12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We note that the proceedings below were chequered by a host of bitter
                        allegations made by the parties against one another. Accusations of
                        infidelity and irresponsibility were rampant as each tried to vilify the
                        other while downplaying their personal indiscretions. In any event, as
                        rightly noted by the Judge, the alleged adulterous behaviour of both
                        parties, even if true, was irrelevant to the determination of the
                        ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of our current "no fault" basis of divorce law, <em>it would serve no purpose to dwell on the question of who did
                            what, save where there might be a direct impact on the legal issues
                            proper (such as a particular party's capacity to contribute towards the
                            matrimonial assets or to care for his or her children)</em>.
                        Instead, the primary objective of the law is to facilitate this transitional
                        period of emotional upheaval for all parties concerned, not least the
                        children. <em>The salutary objectives sought to be achieved
                            by the ancillary orders of division of matrimonial assets, maintenance
                            of a former wife and custody of the children remain paramount in guiding
                            our review of the Judge's ancillary orders.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Therefore, I do not accept the husband’s
                    submission that the wife’s act of poisoning him with arsenic serves to
                    negate all her indirect contributions such that she should not obtain any share
                    in the matrimonial assets. There is no relation between her act of poisoning him
                    and her prior indirect contributions to the family and on this basis, such
                    indirect contributions must still be recognised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I also do not accept the husband’s
                    submission that this court should reduce the wife’s share in the
                    matrimonial assets to reflect its disapproval of her act of poisoning him. This
                    detracts from the objective of this court to reach a just and equitable
                    distribution of the matrimonial assets. The court’s power to divide the
                    matrimonial assets between former spouses was never intended to serve a punitive
                    function. Furthermore, as pointed out by the wife, she has already received her
                    just deserts by serving one year’s imprisonment for her act of poisoning
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The husband also relied on the case of
                        <em>Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    130 (“<em>Tan Bee Giok</em>”) and the cases
                    cited within to illustrate how misconduct may be factored into the court’s
                    consideration. However, that case and the cases it cited dealt with the
                    consideration of misconduct by the court when dealing with the issue of
                    maintenance and not the division of matrimonial assets. Therefore they are not
                    applicable here as the underlying principles concerning maintenance differ from
                    those concerning the division of matrimonial assets. I shall deal with <em>Tan Bee Giok</em> in the later part of this judgment when I
                    discuss the issue of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Nonetheless, I must consider the fact that the
                    poisoning of the husband has a direct implication on the wife’s indirect
                    contributions in the form of her caregiver role as regards looking after the
                    husband from 2004 onwards. Instead of caring for her husband, she caused him
                    harm by poisoning his tea and food. At that juncture, she was no longer
                    performing the functions of a housewife with her husband’s interests at
                    heart. It cannot be said that her indirect contributions towards the family were
                    the same before and after she began poisoning the husband. Therefore, her
                    indirect contributions towards her husband declined significantly from 2004. I
                    also note that her son had graduated with a degree in veterinarian medicine from
                    Glasgow University in 2004 and began working and looking after himself. Hence,
                    the wife’s indirect contributions towards the family were drastically
                    reduced from 2004 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I do not accept the husband’s submission
                    that the wife’s indirect contributions towards the family came to an end
                    in 2004 when she started to poison him. On the facts, the wife continued to
                    contribute towards the family after 2004 even though she may not have taken good
                    care of the husband. I emphasise the importance of applying a broad-brush
                    approach in ensuring a just and equitable division. Even though she poisoned the
                    husband, the court must still consider the fact that she had contributed in
                    other ways such as keeping the household in order and paying for other
                    miscellaneous household expenses. Hence, I must still consider her indirect
                    contributions made to the family from 2004 onwards although they would be lesser
                    compared to her indirect contributions made prior to her poisoning the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I would also like to mention that by coming to
                    the conclusion that the wife’s indirect contributions were reduced from
                    2004 onwards, I am not punishing the wife for her act of poisoning the husband.
                    I am merely deducing the appropriate indirect contributions made by her in the
                    course of the marriage.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9_1"></a>9       The wife does not dispute the items listed but
                    she submitted that the husband has failed to make full and frank disclosure by
                    concealing some of his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The husband is unwilling to give a share of the matrimonial
                        assets to the wife because she poisoned him with arsenic. Alternatively, he
                        is only prepared to give her 20% if the court is minded to apportion part of
                        the matrimonial assets in the wife’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The wife, on the other hand, submitted that
                    she is deserving of a share of 50% of the matrimonial assets. She further
                    submitted that this court should draw an adverse inference against the husband
                    as he had concealed some of his assets. She argued that she should be awarded a
                    further 10% of the matrimonial assets on this basis. Thus she is making a
                    counterclaim amounting to a total of 60% of the matrimonial
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Review of cases on division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I shall first deal with the division of
                    matrimonial assets in the absence of any adverse inference drawn. In the
                    husband’s submissions, he acknowledges that the case precedents suggest
                    that for marriages of 17 to 35 years with children, the proportion awarded
                    ranged from 35% to 50%. The husband cited the case of <em>Chan
                        Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon</em> [2012] 3 SLR 402 (“<em>Chan Yuen Boey</em>”). In that case, Steven Chong J
                    (as he then was) reviewed the past cases and came to the conclusion that
                    “the proportion awarded to homemaker wives who have made modest financial
                    contributions for marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with children ranged between
                    35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets”. At [34] to [35], the learned
                    judge said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From my review of the cases, the proportion awarded to homemaker wives who
                        have made modest financial contributions for marriages lasting 17 to 35
                        years with children ranged between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial
                        assets (see <em>ZD v ZE</em> [2008] SGHC 225, <em>Tan Cheng Guan v Tan Hwee Lee</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1148,
                            <em>AXC v AXD</em> [2012] SGHC 15, <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 416,
                            <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000] 2
                        SLR(R) 659, <em>Rosaline Singh v Jayabalan
                            Samidurai</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 457 and <em>Lock
                            Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 ("<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>")). Where the wife also worked and
                        supported the family financially, the courts have not hesitated to award her
                        up to 60% of the total assets (see <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew
                            Kim Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 and <em>Tan Bee
                            Bee v Lim Kim Chin</em> [2004] SGHC 242 ("<em>Tan
                            Bee Bee</em>")).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife was less
                        than 35%, typically concerned cases where the total pool of matrimonial
                        assets had been very substantial, in excess of $100m (see, <em>Ng Ngah Len @ Datin Sandra Kuah v Kuah Tian Nam @ Dato Peter
                            Kuah</em> [2003] SGHC 109 ("<em>Ng Ngah
                            Len</em>") and <em>Yeo Chong Lin (CA)</em>).
                        In those exceptional situations, the apportionment to the wife had been, in
                        absolute terms, substantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     One case cited in <em>Chan Yuen
                        Boey</em> is of particular relevance. In <em>ZD v ZE
                        and Another</em> [2008] SGHC 225 (“<em>ZD v
                        ZE</em>”), the wife in a marriage which lasted 17 years was
                    awarded 40% of the matrimonial assets. There were three children whom she took
                    care of and she also worked in the husband’s companies doing accounts. As
                    she was a homemaker, her direct contributions amounted to only 6% of the
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There is another case not cited in <em>Chan Yuen Boey</em> that is of relevance. In <em>Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935
                        (“<em>Pang Rosaline</em>”), the marriage
                    lasted for 32 years and there were children. The trial judge divided one of two
                    matrimonial properties in the proportion of 80:20 in favour of the husband. This
                    was varied by the Court of Appeal to 60:40 in favour of the husband. The Court
                    of Appeal held at [25] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bearing the above principles in mind, we were of the view that a
                        “just and equitable” division of both the Neptune Court
                        property as well as the Sennett Road property pursuant to s112(1) of the Act
                        would (having regard to all the circumstances) be in the ratio of 40% to the
                        wife and 60% to the husband. In the circumstances, we varied the order of
                        the court below to reflect this decision (<em>viz</em>,
                        that the Neptune Court property also be apportioned in the ratio of 40% to
                        the wife and 60% to the husband, instead of 20% to the wife and 80% to the
                        husband as the Judge had originally ordered in the court below). In this
                        regard, and by way of recapitulation, <em>we bore in mind, in
                            particular, the fact that the wife had in fact made indirect
                            contributions to the marriage as well as the fact that she had in fact
                            contributed (albeit in a much smaller proportion) towards the direct
                            financing of the Neptune Court property</em> (we pause to observe,
                        parenthetically, that, if these additional reasons were not taken into
                        account, the Judge’s decision with respect to the Neptune Court
                        property would, in fact, have been rather generous). In arriving at our
                        decision, <em>we also bore in mind the husband’s
                            indirect contributions</em> (see also <em>NK v
                            NL</em> ([21] supra) at [37]) as well as the fact that he had
                        contributed significantly more towards the direct financing of the Sennett
                        Road property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In this case, the marriage lasted 34 years
                    with one child. The husband was the main financial provider of the family. The
                    matrimonial assets in the form of investments in properties were through the
                    sole efforts of the husband. Unlike the homemaker wives in <em>ZD
                        v ZE</em> and <em>Pang Rosaline</em>, the wife
                    here did not directly contribute to the purchase of the matrimonial properties.
                    However, the wife had made significant financial contributions towards the
                    family in other ways such as financing the son’s tertiary education. I
                    bear in mind that the wife had made important indirect non-financial
                    contributions to the family in her role as a homemaker over a long period of
                    time. However, I am also mindful of the fact that the indirect non-financial
                    contributions of the wife from 2004 onwards (7 years) were substantially lesser
                    than that before 2004 (27 years).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 112(2) of the Women’s Charter
                    requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the case as well as the
                    factors listed therein. Furthermore, under s 112(2)(h), the court is required to
                    have regard to the factors listed in s 114(1) in so far as they are relevant.
                    Section 114(1)(b) expects the court to have regard to “the financial
                    needs … which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to
                    have in the foreseeable future”. Bearing this in mind, I note that the
                    husband is in poor health largely because of the wife’s arsenic poisoning.
                    He will require a variety of medical care in the future which will likely be
                    costly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Therefore, in the absence of any adverse
                    inference drawn, a just and equitable division will be to award the wife 35% and
                    the husband 65% of the following matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     money paid into court following the
                        sale of 30 Dafne Street which amounts to $1,906,085.44;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the sum of
                        $192,892.85 in the husband’s OCBC Easisave
                Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Each party will retain their respective assets
                    in the CPF accounts. The wife will retain the money in her DBS Savings
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     With this proportion of 65:35 in favour of the
                    husband in mind, I shall consider the wife’s submission for an adverse
                    inference to be drawn against the husband for his concealment of some of his
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Drawing of adverse inference</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The wife urged the court to draw an adverse
                    inference against the husband as he had not made full and frank disclosure of
                    all the matrimonial assets. The law on drawing adverse inferences is succinctly
                    stated in the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo
                        Chai Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... We consider that the trial judge was correct in rejecting the
                        Wife’s plea to do so. It is well established that in order for a court
                        to draw an adverse inference, there must, in the first place, be some
                        substratum of evidence that establishes a <em>prima
                            facie</em> case against the person against whom the inference is
                        to be drawn. In addition, it must be shown that the person against whom the
                        inference is to be drawn has some particular access to the information he is
                        said to be hiding (perhaps because it is peculiarly within his knowledge).
                        In other words, the court’s ability to draw an adverse inference does
                        not and cannot displace the legal burden of proof that continues to lie with
                        the plaintiff, or, as in this appeal, the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The wife alleged that the husband was not
                    truthful in the disclosure of his assets pertaining to his bank accounts and the
                    sale of several properties during their marriage. She submitted that he had not
                    accounted for large sums of money which were withdrawn from his OCBC Easisave
                    Account and his OCBC Current Account (Account No XXXXXXXX2001) (“OCBC
                    Current Account”) and for the sale proceeds arising from the sale of
                    matrimonial properties. After considering the evidence, I am of the view that
                    the husband had failed to made full and frank disclosure for the reasons given
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Husband’s OCBC Easisave Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There was an initial dispute as to the amount
                    stated by the husband in his OCBC Easisave Account. The husband indicated the
                    balance in this account as $192,892.85 while the wife stated that it was
                    $412,738.94. The parties clarified that the apparent difference was due to the
                    different times at which the balance in the OCBC Easisave Account was taken. The
                    husband indicated that the balance of $192,892.85 provided by him was the
                    balance as at 11 August 2012. The wife took the balance as at 31 March 2012 when
                    the amount was $412,738.94.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is not disputed that large sums amounting
                    to $832,737.50 were withdrawn from this account from 23 November 2009 to 16 July
                        2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> These withdrawals were mostly made via cash
                    cheques. The husband alleged that these were used for his medical and personal
                    expenses. However, he could only produce medical bills totalling
                        $127,833.47.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He claimed that his wife
                    had taken many of the other receipts and that he had actually spent close to
                    $200,000 on medical expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However, the burden of proof is on the
                    husband to show that the receipts were in the wife’s possession. No such
                    evidence is produced before the court. Furthermore, he could have obtained such
                    receipts from the hospitals or clinics he had visited, or alternatively, sought
                    discovery from the wife. Therefore, only a sum of $127,833.47 can be accounted
                    for by way of medical expenses and there remains a sum of $704,904.03
                    unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The husband further added that he had invested
                    a large portion of those monies on oil and gas in Indonesia. These investments
                    were purportedly made by the husband in the name of his maid, Eny Rahayu. He
                    claimed that the maid had drugged him with sleep medication at the end of
                    December 2012 and left with all the documentation relating to the investments.
                    The maid could not be found. The husband purportedly had his niece contact the
                    police and police officers from Bedok Police Division visited him to enquire
                    about the incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> These are all bare assertions
                    which are not supported by any credible evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The husband has only adduced evidence in the
                    form of his passport which shows that he had travelled to Indonesia frequently
                    and an Indonesian ATM card. The trips to Indonesia prove nothing and could have
                    very well been for leisure purposes. This can be gleaned from the photographs
                    adduced by the wife showing the husband posing intimately with the maid at
                    informal venues in Indonesia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> As for the Indonesian ATM card, I agree
                    with the wife that in the absence of any bank statements (which the husband
                    should have provided), it does not prove the husband’s assertions in any
                    way. I find that the husband has failed to prove his assertion that he had
                    invested part of $832,737.50 on oil and gas in Indonesia on a balance of
                    probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Lastly, the husband also alleged that he had
                    spent part of the monies withdrawn on personal expenses and maid
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> He has adduced no evidence to prove
                    this and I do not accept his assertions. In any event, based on his own
                    affidavit of assets and means, his personal monthly expenses (inclusive of the
                    maid’s salary) add up to $1,842 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    Given that there are approximately 32 months between 23 November 2009 and 16
                    July 2012, the total amount expended on him and the maid during that period
                    should only be an estimated $58,944 ($1,842 per month x 32 months). This would
                    mean that even if I believe the husband on this point, there would still be a
                    sum of $645,960.04 that remains unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Therefore, I find that the husband had not
                    adequately accounted for a substantial portion of the $832,737.50 withdrawn by
                    him between 23 November 2009 and 16 July 2012 from the OCBC Easisave
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Husband’s OCBC Current Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The wife further alleged that the
                    husband’s OCBC Current Account had a sum of $623,556.71 in November 2009.
                    The husband argued that the wife was mistaken as the balance was marked in the
                    bank statement as “DR”. This means that this is a debit entry
                    which is attributable to the husband’s overdraft. I notice that there was
                    a large deposit on 23 November 2009 for the sum of $632,131.00 to clear the
                    debit entry in this account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The
                    husband explained that the overdraft was a result of the purchase of 30 Dafne
                    Street on 4 February 2008 and it was satisfied using the proceeds from the sale
                    of 22G Jalan Ulu Siglap.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The husband has adduced
                    evidence in the form of the completion account for 22G Jalan Ulu Siglap and the
                    conveyancing lawyers’ letters to show that cashier’s orders were
                    indeed made in favour of OCBC to satisfy the outstanding amount in the overdraft
                    account. I see no reason to disbelieve the husband on this and I accept his
                    explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sale of 22G Jalan Ulu Siglap</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The wife also took issue with the sale
                    proceeds of 22G Jalan Ulu Siglap. She alleged that the sale proceeds should be
                    $1,013,072.20 and not $1,057,541.22.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The husband’s bank statement shows
                    that $1,057,541.22 was deposited into his OCBC Easisave Account on 20 November
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The wife’s only contention was that the
                    completion date for the sale of this property was on 20 November
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The wife is of the belief that the
                    money could not have been deposited on the same day as shown in the
                    husband’s bank statement. The earliest possible date would be the next
                    day. Hence, she came to the conclusion that the sale proceeds of 22G Jalan Ulu
                    Siglap was unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The wife has adduced no evidence to show that
                    the earliest possible date money would be deposited pursuant to a
                    cashier’s order is the following day. It is only the wife’s personal
                    belief and I am not inclined to accept it. Furthermore, I am satisfied by the
                    completion account adduced by the husband, which shows that the proceeds to be
                    received by him amounted to $1,057,541.22.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> I do
                    not think there is any failure on the husband’s part in accounting for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The total sale proceeds amount to about $6m.
                    The husband alleged that these properties were sold with massive loans
                    outstanding and some of the properties were even sold at a loss. I noticed that
                    these were assertions made without any proof. He has failed to produce any
                    accounts regarding the sale and purchase transactions of those
                    properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Nonetheless, in considering these properties,
                    it would be too simplistic to look at the total sale proceeds alone. The husband
                    may have used the proceeds arising from the sale of one property to purchase the
                    next property, just as how he had used the sale proceeds from 22G Jalan Ulu
                    Siglap to satisfy the overdraft incurred from the purchase of 30 Dafne
                    Street.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The most obvious failure of the husband in
                    making full and frank disclosure arises from his failure to account for
                    $704,904.03 out of the total sum of $832,737.50 that was withdrawn from the OCBC
                    Easisave Account from 23 November 2009 to 16 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I would also like to note that the husband has
                    also made allegations that the wife had “siphoned” moneys from
                    him. I am not inclined to believe these bare assertions as they are not
                    supported by any credible evidence at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What action can the court take when it decides to draw an adverse
                inference?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>NK v NL</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal was also faced with the situation in which it was justified to
                    draw an adverse inference against the husband. The court in that case did not
                    increase the notional amount of assets in the non-disclosing party’s name,
                    but instead, increased the proportion of assets given to the other party. The
                    Court of Appeal held at [62] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although we have drawn an adverse inference against the husband in the
                        present case in so far as the discrepancy in his declared assets is
                        concerned, we note that the amount concerned is large (approximately $2.7m)
                        and (more importantly) we have been given no explanation as to what has
                        happened to this particular amount. In the circumstances, it might be more
                        just and equitable (not to mention, practical) to order a higher proportion
                        of the <em>known</em> assets to be given to the wife.
                        This would also give effect (albeit in a more general fashion) to the
                        adverse inference which this court has drawn against the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The husband has similarly failed to account
                    for what happened to the $704,904.03 withdrawn from the OCBC Easisave Account.
                    Hence, I am inclined to award the wife an additional 7% over and above her 35%
                    share of the matrimonial assets. The final division of the matrimonial assets
                    shall be in the proportion of 58:42 in favour of the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance of the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On the issue of maintenance of the wife, I
                    have to decide whether she should be given maintenance. If the answer is yes, I
                    then have to determine the appropriate and just amount for her
                    maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Husband’s stand on the wife’s request for
                maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The husband first submitted that the wife
                    should not receive any maintenance as a result of her malicious act of poisoning
                    him with arsenic. However, the husband submitted in the alternative that should
                    the court be inclined to award maintenance to the wife, it should only be for a
                    period of three years. He acknowledged that the request for maintenance of $980
                    per month in the wife’s affidavit of assets and means<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> is reasonable. However, he submitted that the
                    wife has been receiving monthly allowances from their son. Furthermore, the wife
                    had led a frugal lifestyle and he had been giving her $500 per month as
                    maintenance during the marriage. Thus, the amount of maintenance to be awarded
                    should be $500 per month for a period of three years. On this basis, the lump
                    sum maintenance should only be $18,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The wife’s claim for maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The wife, on the other hand, is seeking a lump
                    sum maintenance of $200,000. She is now 72 years old. Since her release from
                    prison in 2012, the husband refused to allow her to return to the matrimonial
                    home and stopped providing her any form of maintenance. Thus, she is seeking
                    maintenance in arrears of three years and future maintenance for the next 13
                    years. The duration for future maintenance is calculated on the basis that the
                    life expectancy of women in Singapore is 85 years old and that the wife is 72
                    years old now, the difference being 13 years. She denies the husband’s
                    allegation that their son has been giving her a monthly allowance. She is
                    seeking a lump sum maintenance of $200,000. This is calculated at $1,000 per
                    month for 16 years, <em>ie</em> $192,000, which is rounded
                    up to $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Could the court take the conduct of the wife’s act of arsenic
                poisoning into consideration on the issue of maintenance?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In relation to the ordering of maintenance of
                    a wife or former wife, s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so
                        to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, <em>having regard to their conduct</em>, just to do so, in the
                        financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not
                        broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial
                        obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Hence, the conduct (or misconduct in this
                    case) of the parties can be taken into consideration. Nonetheless, it is only
                    one of the many factors, such as those listed in s 114(1) of the Women’s
                    Charter, that the court must consider. As in the case of the division of
                    matrimonial assets discussed above (at [22]–[23]), the factor relating to
                    the misconduct of either spouse should be used judiciously and should only be
                    seriously considered if it has a direct impact on the legal issues proper.
                    Bearing this in mind, I consider the case of <em>Wachtel v
                        Wachtel</em> [1973] Fam 72 which deals with the consideration of a
                    party’s misconduct when deciding the issue of maintenance. Lord Denning MR
                    in delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal held at 90:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been suggested that there should be a “discount” or
                        “reduction” in what the wife is to receive because of her
                        supposed misconduct, guilt or blame (whatever word is used). We cannot
                        accept this argument. In the vast majority of cases it is repugnant to the
                        principles underlying the new legislation, and in particular the Act of
                        1969. There will be many cases in which a wife (though once considered
                        guilty or blameworthy) will have cared for the home and looked after the
                        family for very many years. Is she to be deprived of the benefit otherwise
                        to be accorded to her by section 5 (1) (f) because she may share
                        responsibility for the breakdown with her husband? There will no doubt be a
                        residue of cases where the conduct of one of the parties is in the judge's
                        words, ante, p. 80C–D, “both obvious and gross,” so much
                        so that to order one party to support another whose conduct falls into this
                        category is repugnant to anyone's sense of justice. In such a case the court
                        remains free to decline to afford financial support or to reduce the support
                        which it would otherwise have ordered. But, short of cases falling into this
                        category, the court should not reduce its order for financial provision
                        merely because of what was formerly regarded as guilt or blame. To do so
                        would be to impose a fine for supposed misbehaviour in the course of an
                        unhappy married life. Mr. Ewbank disputed this and claimed that it was but
                        justice that a wife should suffer for her supposed misbehaviour. We do not
                        agree. Criminal justice often requires the imposition of financial and
                        indeed custodial penalties. But in the financial adjustments consequent upon
                        the dissolution of a marriage which has irretrievably broken down, the
                        imposition of financial penalties ought seldom to find a place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This has been further discussed in <em>Harnett v Harnett</em> [1973] Fam 156, where Bagnall J
                    commented at 165 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will not be just to have regard to conduct unless there is a very
                        substantial [display] between the parties on that score. Ormrod J. and the
                        Court of Appeal in <em>Wachtel v Wachtel</em> [1973]
                        Fam. 72 used the phrase “obvious and gross.” In this phrase I
                        think that “gross” describes the conduct;
                        “obvious” describes the clarity or certainty with which it is
                        seen to be gross. But the conduct of both parties must be considered. If the
                        conduct of one is substantially as bad as that of the other, then it matters
                        not how gross that conduct is; they will weigh equally in the balance. In my
                        view to satisfy the test the conduct must be obvious and gross in the sense
                        that the party concerned must be plainly seen to have wilfully persisted in
                        conduct, or a course of conduct, calculated to destroy the marriage in
                        circumstances in which the other party is substantially blameless.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     These two cases, which are relied on by the
                    husband, were considered by G P Selvam J in <em>Tan Bee
                        Giok</em>. Selvam J went on to state at [25] that if both parties were
                    substantially responsible for the breakdown of the marriage, it would be
                    unnecessary to review the conduct of the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In applying the rule the court must take into consideration not only the
                        conduct of the wife but also that of the husband. If both parties are to
                        blame for the breakdown, no useful purpose would be served in asking the
                        parties to rehearse the bitterness and recriminations which were brought to
                        an end by the divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I agree with the principle laid down by Selvam
                    J and the English cases in relation to the consideration of the misconduct of
                    either party. In this case, the wife’s poisoning of the husband could be
                    said to have substantially caused the breakdown of the marriage. However, I also
                    note that the husband cannot be said to be substantially blameless. It was found
                    by the Criminal Court that sentenced the wife to one year’s imprisonment
                    for her act of poisoning the husband that she was trying to get back at her
                    husband as a result of the husband’s behaviour. She was found to have
                    suffered from a long history of chronic spousal emotional and verbal abuse which
                    the Family Court recognised as a ground for divorce when she was granted an
                    interim judgment. The husband referred this court to the wife’s confession
                    to the police that she had wanted to make the husband “suffer in pain by
                    poisoning him with the ‘AntiAnt’ powder”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> In this same confession, the wife explained why
                    she did it: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I told the recorder that I did that as I could not tolerate my
                        husband’s acts of violence towards me as he had physically and
                        mentally abused me in all of our 31 years of marriage. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the end of 2004, I totally broke down and one day when I returned from
                        the beach, I was so stressful thinking about my life. I had intended to
                        commit suicide in fact. But then again, I was also very frustrated with my
                        husband who without fail scolded me day and night for nothing. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Nonetheless, the wife reacted in a grossly
                    disproportionate manner by resorting to poisoning the husband. I find myself
                    unable to turn a blind eye to the wife’s malicious act in arriving at the
                    proper sum of maintenance to be awarded. Her conduct must result in a lower sum
                    of maintenance being ordered. She should have divorced the husband earlier on
                    instead of resorting to poisoning him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conditions of both parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In any event, the direct consequence of the
                    poisoning of the husband is his deterioration in health which must be
                    considered. The husband was hospitalised several times from 2004 to 2009. He is
                    now having difficulty walking and eating. There were stages when the husband
                    nearly died. The husband said he now has the following medical conditions due to
                    the arsenic poisoning:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>

                        eczema.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As discussed above at [42], the husband has
                    spent $127,833.47 on his medical bills from 23 November 2009 to 16 July 2012.
                    The husband will continue to incur such medical expenses. The husband is now 74
                    years old with no income. He also needs a full-time caregiver to help him with
                    his daily activities. Therefore, as a result of the poisoning by the wife and
                    the consequent deterioration in the husband’s health, I must consider the
                    husband’s financial needs in terms of added medical expenses and physical
                    disabilities as required by s 114(b) and s 114(e) of the Women’s Charter
                    respectively. This will go towards a lower maintenance sum being ordered for the
                    wife. Although the wife is old as well, she is not plagued by the health
                    problems that the husband is suffering from.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Taking all factors into consideration, I am
                    inclined to award the wife a lump sum maintenance of $18,000, calculated at 3
                    years x 12 months x $500 per month. I shall not make an order for arrears of
                    maintenance as I am of the view that this lump sum maintenance is adequate and
                    fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In summary, the wife will receive 42% of the
                    following matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     money paid into court following the
                        sale of 30 Dafne Street which amounts to $1,906,085.44;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     the sum of
                        $192,892.85 in the husband’s OCBC Easisave
                Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Each party will retain their respective assets
                    in the CPF accounts. The wife will retain the money in her DBS Savings
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The wife will receive a lump sum maintenance
                    of $18,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     There will be no order as to
                costs.</p>
