The plaintiff now applies on various grounds to set aside these awards. In relation to the principal award, the plaintiff’s main ground is that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with its making which has caused prejudice to the plaintiff. The breach on which the plaintiff relies is either that the arbitrator failed to consider or to attempt to understand the plaintiff’s evidence and submissions on a central aspect of its case or that the plaintiff was unable to present its case on that aspect. In relation to the two subsequent awards, the plaintiff’s ground is that the arbitrator had already made an award on costs in his principal award and therefore, being <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, lacked the jurisdiction to revisit his costs orders as he attempted to do in the correction award and the costs award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having considered the parties’ written and oral submissions, I have dismissed the plaintiff’s application to set aside the principal award.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On 6 February 2008, the engineers approved by email, and with certain amendments, the first set of shop drawings. These shop drawings were sufficient for the plaintiff to start constructing the diaphragm walls. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Even after 6 February 2008, however, the engineers made further changes to the shop drawings and responded to various queries by the plaintiff. It was not until 18 February 2008 that the engineers stamped their approval on the shop drawings. The plaintiff started construction of the diaphragm walls on 18 February 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant’s case in the arbitration was that the architects had approved the shop drawings on 6 February 2008 and that the plaintiff should accordingly have started constructing the diaphragm walls on that date. The plaintiff’s case was that the architects had approved the shop drawings only on 18 February 2008, and that the plaintiff was therefore not responsible for the 12-day delay from 6 February 2008 to 18 February 2008. The plaintiff refers to its claim for an extension of time arising from the delay in starting construction of the diaphragm walls as its first extension of time claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The changes to the toe levels for the diaphragm wall panels also required the plaintiff to excavate significant additional quantities of rock. The plaintiff refers to its claim for an extension of time arising from the delay caused by having to carry out this additional rock excavation as its second extension of time claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The architects grant extensions of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 By a letter dated 25 March 2008, the plaintiff sought an extension of time arising from the engineers’ changes in the toe levels of the diaphragm wall panels for Blocks 1 and 2. The letter identified two effects that flowed from the engineers’ changes. The first effect was the delay in starting construction of the diaphragm walls. The second effect was the additional rock excavation required to construct the diaphragm walls. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Arising from the first effect, the plaintiff claimed an extension of time of 30 days, from 23 January 2008 to 21 February 2008. Arising from the second effect, the plaintiff estimated that the additional rock excavation would result in 118 days of delay.

The grounds given were that the true reasons for the delay in starting construction of the diaphragm walls were all within the plaintiff’s control.

</div> the plaintiff denied that its first extension of time of claim was necessitated by causes within its own control. The plaintiff therefore maintained its claim under that head for an extension of 30 days. As for its second extension of time claim, the plaintiff recomputed the additional quantities of soil and rock and estimated that it was entitled to an extension of 64 days. It reiterated that this figure was only an estimate and that it could not conclusively determine the number of days it was entitled to until after it had completed the excavations. On that basis, the plaintiff asked the architect for a 94-day extension of time, comprising 30 days on its first claim and 64 days on its second claim.

That provision reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may set aside award</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">48.</span>—(1) An award may be set aside by the Court – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) if the party who applies to the Court to set aside the award proves to the satisfaction of the Court that – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vii) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span>”), the Court of Appeal held (at [29]) that a party challenging an arbitration award for breach of natural justice must establish: (a) which rule of natural justice was breached; (b) how it was breached; (c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced its rights. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The policy of minimal curial intervention </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Court of Appeal also identified (in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span> at [65]) the court’s approach to an application to set aside an award for breach of natural justice. As a general proposition, the courts will not readily accede to such an application, given the policy of minimal curial intervention. That policy is characterised by a desire to “support, and not to displace, the arbitral process” (<span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 at [29]). That desire is, in turn, founded on the courts’ recognition that the parties have chosen arbitration as their dispute resolution process and, within that process, have chosen their own adjudicators. Just as they accept the benefits of the party autonomy which they bargained for, so must they accept its consequences (<span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I summarise briefly the principles stated in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee </span>that are relevant to the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Parties to arbitration have, in general, a right to be heard on every issue that may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A successful party should not be deprived of the fruits of arbitration by technical challenges or an attempt to reagitate the merits of the dispute disguised as a setting-aside application. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Minimal curial intervention is underpinned by two considerations: first, the need to recognise the autonomy of the arbitral process by encouraging finality; and second, that parties who opt for arbitration acknowledge and accept the attendant risk of having only a very limited right of recourse to the courts. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It is not the function of the court to comb an award to assign blame or to find fault in the process. Rather, the court should read an award generously so as to remedy only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice which actually cause prejudice.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An arbitrator’s duty to deal with the issues and submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Where a dissatisfied party alleges that a tribunal failed to deal with an issue before it, the courts will take a “generous approach” toward reading the arbitral award: <span class="font-italic">BLC and others v BLB and another </span>[2014] 4 SLR 79 (“<span class="font-italic">BLC</span>”) at [86]. In this regard, Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”) (at [44]) cited with approval certain observations of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Atkins Limited v The Secretary of State for Transport </span>[2013] EWHC 139 (“<span class="font-italic">Atkins</span>”). In that case, Akenhead J said at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I consider that it is very important that, where the Court is asked to conduct an exercise to determine whether or not in reality and substance an arbitrator has failed to deal with all the issues put to it [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] within the meaning of Section 68(2)(d), <span class="font-italic">the Court is not required to carry out a hypercritical or excessively syntactical analysis of what the arbitrator has written</span>. This is particularly so where the arbitrator in question is not only eminent and highly respected in his field but also has immense legal experience in the relevant field of law concerned. In a clear and obvious case, of course the Court will find that the ground exists and can then move on to consider whether or not the circumstances merit interfering with the award. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Chan Seng Onn J also cited the decision of Bingham J (as Lord Bingham then was) in <span class="font-italic">Zermalt</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings SA v Nu-Life Upholstery Repairs Ltd </span>[1985] 2 EGLR 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Zermalt</span>”) at [14]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a matter of general approach, the courts strive to uphold arbitration awards. <span class="font-italic">They do not approach them with a meticulous legal eye endeavouring to pick holes, inconsistencies and faults in awards and with the objective of upsetting or frustrating the process of arbitration. </span><span class="font-italic">Far from it. The approach is to read an arbitration award in a reasonable and commercial way, expecting, as is usually the case, that there will be no substantial fault that can be found with it</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The observations in <span class="font-italic">Atkins </span>and <span class="font-italic">Zermalt</span> were approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BLC </span>at [86] and <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [59]. In <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [38]) that the parties do not have a right to a “correct” decision from an arbitrator. They have only a right to a decision which is within the ambit of their consent to have their dispute arbitrated and which follows a fair process. This means that “poor reasoning on the part of an arbitral tribunal is not a ground to set aside an arbitral award; even a misunderstanding of the arguments put forward by a party is not such a ground” (at [59]). Thus, following the policy of minimal curial intervention, the courts will not interfere in the merits of an award in order to rescue parties who have made forensic choices that they might come to regret, or to offer them a second chance to canvass the merits of their respective cases (at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>, Chan J identified and discussed an arbitrator’s duty to deal with the arguments presented (at [72] – [77]) and the duty to attempt to understand the parties’ submissions (at [88] – [91]). First, in relation to a tribunal’s duty to deal with the arguments presented:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A tribunal does not have a duty to deal with every issue that each party raises. The tribunal is required only to deal with the essential issues.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Tribunals must be given fair latitude to select which issues are essential. A court should not be too ready to intervene in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In deciding the essential issues, the tribunal need not deal with every argument which the parties have canvassed under each essential issue. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As long as a decision on one argument suffices to resolve an essential issue, the tribunal need not go on to consider all other arguments canvassed under that issue and which have become of academic interest only. As Judith Prakash J stated in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 733 at [60], “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) An issue need not be resolved expressly in an award; it may be resolved implicitly. Resolving an issue does not have to entail navigating all the arguments and all the evidence. If the outcome of certain issues flows from the conclusion of a specific logically anterior issue, the tribunal may dispense with delving into the merits of the arguments and evidence for the former. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As for the tribunal’s duty to attempt to understand the parties’ submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A tribunal must demonstrably have at least attempted to comprehend the parties’ arguments on the essential issues. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The inability to ascertain the explanation for a tribunal’s decision is only one of the factors which may establish that the tribunal did not in fact properly attempt to consider or comprehend the parties’ arguments. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The central inquiry is whether the award shows that the tribunal applied its mind to the critical issues and arguments. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) An assessment of whether the tribunal attempted to understand the parties’ submissions is effectively an investigation into the tribunal’s mind. The tribunal may, after applying its mind to an issue, come to a decision which may be characterised as inexplicable because it has failed to comprehend the submissions or has comprehended them erroneously. That is not a breach of the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that a court will not infer that a tribunal has failed to consider an important issue unless the inference is clear and virtually inescapable (at [46] – [47]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 To fail to consider an important issue that has been pleaded in an arbitration is a breach of natural justice because in such a case, the arbitrator would not have brought his mind to bear on an important aspect of the dispute before him. Consideration of the pleaded issues is an essential feature of the rule of natural justice that is encapsulated in the Latin adage, <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> (see also <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span>”) at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation of Victoria v Wood Hall Ltd &amp; Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd </span>[1978] VR 385 at 386). <span class="font-italic">Front Row </span>is useful in so far as it demonstrates what must be shown to make out a breach of natural justice on the basis that the arbitrator failed to consider an important pleaded issue. It will usually be a matter of inference rather than of explicit indication that the arbitrator wholly missed one or more important pleaded issues. However, <span class="font-italic">the inference – that the arbitrator indeed failed to consider an important pleaded issue – if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be clear and virtually inescapable. If the facts are also consistent with the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary (notwithstanding that this view may have been formed based on a misunderstanding of the aggrieved party’s case), then the inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice should </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic">  be drawn.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span> was recently considered in <span class="font-italic">AQU v AQV </span>[2015] SGHC 26 (“<span class="font-italic">AQU</span>”), where the High Court judge distilled the very principles which we have just enunciated above (see <span class="font-italic">AQU </span>at [30]-[35]). The judge in <span class="font-italic">AQU </span>also considered the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”), and reiterated the proposition that no party to an arbitration had a right to expect the arbitral tribunal to accept its arguments, regardless of how strong and credible it perceived those arguments to be (see <span class="font-italic">AQU </span>at [35]), citing <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>at [94]). This principle is important because it points to <span class="font-italic">an important distinction between, on the one hand, an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument (whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and whether or not as a result of its </span><span class="font-italic">failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits), and, on the other hand, the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument</span>. <span class="font-italic">Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice</span>; the former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics; emphasis in original in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This passage from <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, applied to the present case, means that the plaintiff must demonstrate that this is not a case where the arbitrator simply misunderstood the plaintiff’s submissions or the law on an important issue, or merely chose not to deal with an aspect of the plaintiff’s submissions on that issue because he thought it unnecessary to do so. What the plaintiff must demonstrate is a clear and virtually inescapable inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all<span class="font-italic"> </span>to that aspect of the plaintiff’s submissions. That undoubtedly sets a high bar for the plaintiff. That is rightly so, given the policy of minimal curial intervention and its underlying basis in party autonomy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The requirement of prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The terms of s 48(1)(a)(vii) of the Act (see [52] above) make clear that a successful plaintiff must not only show that a breach of natural justice took place but also that it suffered prejudice by reason of the breach. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W </span><span class="font-italic">Infrastructure</span>”) set out at [54] in clear terms that the requirement to show prejudice requires the plaintiff to show that the breach of natural justice could reasonably have made a difference to the arbitrator’s reasoning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … To say that the court must be satisfied that a different result would definitely ensue before prejudice can be said to have been demonstrated would be incorrect in principle because it would require the court to put itself in the position of the arbitrator and to consider the merits of the issue with the benefit of materials that had not in the event been placed before the arbitrator. Seen in this light, it becomes evident that <span class="font-italic">the real inquiry is whether the breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations. Put another way, the issue is whether the material </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could reasonably </span><span class="font-italic">have made a difference to the arbitrator; rather than whether it </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">would necessarily</span><span class="font-italic"> have done so.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Where it is evident that there is no prospect whatsoever that the material if presented would have made any difference because it wholly lacked any legal or factual weight, then it could not seriously be said that the complainant has suffered actual or real prejudice in not having had the opportunity to present this to the arbitrator (<span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> Soh Beng Tee </span>at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics; emphasis in original in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first extension of time claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As I have mentioned, the plaintiff’s first extension of time claim was that it was entitled to an additional 12 days for the delay in starting construction of the diaphragm walls. The plaintiff’s case before me is that the arbitrator breached the rules of natural justice in rejecting this claim. The plaintiff did not advance this part of its case with great enthusiasm. Indeed, Mr Yeo conceded candidly that, on this issue at least, the arbitrator “posed the right question” to himself”

</div> The 23 June letter does not characterise the 39-day extension of time which it grants in the same specific way. Instead, it characterises the extension of time as being granted “on the ground of instructions issued for the changes in toe depth for diaphragm wall panels issued”. He notes, further, that that letter ends by expressly rejecting all of the plaintiff’s other claims for extensions of time up to that date on all other grounds. He argues that, “on the plain natural reading” of the concluding sentence, the architects thereby rejected all of the plaintiff’s claims preceding 23 June 2008 for an extension of time for additional rock excavation.

</div> Be that as it may, the fact remains that the arbitrator included this table under the heading “The Tribunal’s findings”.

If a tribunal does not express its reasoning on an issue which the parties place before it, there are three possible scenarios. First, the tribunal might have realised that it was an issue for determination but deliberately avoided grappling with it. Second, the tribunal might have overlooked entirely that it was an issue for determination. Third, the tribunal might have realised that it was an issue for determination and arrived at a decision on it without articulating its reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It is only in the first and second scenarios that a breach of natural justice occurs. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>(at [47]), there is a crucial difference between a tribunal’s decision to reject an argument, whether explicitly or implicitly, and its failure even to consider that argument.

</div> that the architects had granted a 54-day extension of time for additional rock excavation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 First, the arbitrator had before him the exchange of letters which passed between the plaintiff and the architects from March 2008 to April 2009. I cannot exclude the possibility that the arbitrator drew from that exchange of correspondence the conclusion not only that the 39-day extension of time granted on 23 June 2008 was for the additional rock excavation, but also that this was the common understanding between the plaintiff, the architects and the defendant. I bear in mind that it was the plaintiff’s own letter of 25 March 2008 which first characterised delay caused by additional rock excavation as an effect which flowed from the design changes to the toe levels of the diaphragm wall panels. Those design changes were the very cause which the architects identified as their basis for granting the 39-day extension of time. In the light of the clear tenor of this correspondence, it is perfectly plausible that the arbitrator viewed the plaintiff’s submission that only a 15-day extension of time had been granted for additional rock excavation as so unconvincing that analysis of it was unnecessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Second, the plaintiff did not develop this issue as part of its case until its closing submissions.

If this pleading was the plaintiff’s attempt to put this issue in play in the arbitration, it did so so obliquely as to be invisible.

It suffices for me to observe that the five sets of submissions which the plaintiff refers to are closing submissions put in after the evidential phase; and the transcript references set out are to the oral closing submissions before the arbitrator.

No breach of natural justice would have occurred. The plaintiff has not persuaded me that there is a clear and virtually inescapable inference to be drawn that such a breach has occurred. The plaintiff is unable to explain why these other inferences are not equally available to be drawn as the one which it urges me to draw. I cannot exclude the possibility that he did not deal explicitly with this issue in the award because he saw no merit in it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No dramatic departure from the submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the same reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the arbitrator departed dramatically from the parties’ evidence and submissions, or that he failed to consider an essential issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As the plaintiff has not satisfied me that the arbitrator failed to consider this issue, I need say no more about these submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff suffered no prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I find also that no prejudice was caused to the plaintiff even if the arbitrator did indeed fail to consider or fail to attempt to understand the plaintiff’s submissions on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>, an alternative ground for Chan Seng Onn J’s dismissal of the setting aside application was that, applying the test in <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>, even if a breach of the rules of natural justice had occurred, the plaintiff had nevertheless not suffered actual or real prejudice (at [115] – [117]). Chan J’s reasoning was that even if the arbitrator had found that certain repairs had not been completed, that finding would probably not have made a difference to his deliberation on the outcome. The arbitrator, in all likelihood, would have maintained his view that the plaintiff ought not to have rejected the notice of readiness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Likewise, I find myself unable to conclude that it could have made a difference to the outcome on this issue if the arbitrator had applied his mind to it. As I have explained earlier, the correspondence between the plaintiff and the architects makes it clear that the 39-day extension of time granted on 23 June 2008 was for additional rock excavation. Therefore, even if I were to assume that the arbitrator had indeed failed to apply his mind to this issue, the tenor of the correspondence is so overwhelmingly against the plaintiff’s case on this issue that I cannot conclude that it could have made a difference to the outcome if he had applied his mind to it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remaining claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The plaintiff makes various other complaints about the arbitrator’s conduct during the arbitration and about the award. In my view, these complaints are meritless and I reject them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The plaintiff alleges that the arbitrator was unable to follow the oral submissions and to grasp the key facts and the critical submissions. As an example, the plaintiff submits that the arbitrator was unable to understand something “as fundamental as who the key personnel in the project were”,

Even if the arbitrator asked questions which the plaintiff considers to be basic, the very fact that the arbitrator asked those questions indicates that he was alive to their importance, was engaged in the matter and was taking steps to ensure that he understood the dispute.

</div> Accordingly, the plaintiff submits, the “inescapable inference” is that the arbitrator did not have regard to any written submissions other than the defendant’s closing submissions of 7 May 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I cannot draw a clear and inescapable inference from the materials presented by the plaintiff that the arbitrator simply lifted sections of his award from the defendant’s closing submissions without applying his mind to the issues. Linguistic similarities between the award and the closing submissions do not lead clearly and inescapably to the conclusion which the plaintiff urges upon me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The costs award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 My decision to set aside that part of the correction award which deals with costs and the entirety of the costs award is not the subject of appeal. I arrived at that decision because of the operation of s 44 of the Act. Section 44(1) deems the principal award to be final and binding on the parties from the moment it was made. Section 44(2) read with s 44(3) prohibits the arbitrator from varying, amending, correcting, reviewing, adding to or revoking the principal award or any part of it after it has been signed and delivered, except as provided in s 43. Section 43 permits the arbitrator only to correct his award, to interpret his award and, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, to make an additional award on a claim presented in the arbitration but omitted from his award. None of those provisions permitted the arbitrator to withdraw the costs orders in his principal award, as he did in his correction award, much less to issue fresh costs orders, as he did in the costs award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In his costs orders in the principal award, the arbitrator rendered a comprehensive decision on all matters relating to the costs of the arbitration, including the defendant’s legal costs, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the costs and expenses of the award. Once he had made these costs orders,

</div> he became <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, certainly on the issue of costs and, in the circumstances of this case, on the entire dispute presented to him. The arbitrator could not revisit the issue of costs because he no longer had jurisdiction to do so.
