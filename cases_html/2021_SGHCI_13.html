In the same vein, the [respondent] reversed the General Information Sheet with the [applicant’s] 42% shareholdings on it and removed the [applicant’s] nominated directors from the [respondent’s] board of directors; (iv) the [respondent] transferred the [applicant’s] 42% shares to Sage Capital without the [applicant’s] consent; and (v) the [respondent] sought to rescind the MOA instead of seeking to incorporate a new company as an available alternative remedy or escape clause as envisaged in Section 2 of the MOA (see Issue 17 above and the [applicant’s] suggested list of issues for determination).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">615. In its post-hearing briefs, the [applicant] focused only on the [respondent’s] alleged breach of Section 2 of the MOA in relation to the [respondent’s] duty to provide the [applicant] with all necessary due diligence documents. In this regard, the [applicant] requests that the Tribunal ‘order [the respondent] to produce the [STB] and other corporate books and documents for [the applicant’s] inspection and examination, pursuant to the due diligence exercise under the MOA.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">616. On 7 February 2020, in response to the Tribunal’s question of whether the [applicant] is ‘only pressing the argument that the [respondent] breached the MOA by failing to comply with its due diligence obligations’, the [applicant] answered as follows: ‘No. In addition to [the respondent’s] failure to comply with its due diligence obligations, [the respondent] breached the MOA by failing to (i) reflect [the applicant’s] ownership of a 42% stake in [the respondent] in the most cost-effective and expeditious way; and (ii) negotiate in good faith the terms of the Shareholder’s Agreement’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">617. Finally, in relation to the [respondent’s] reliance on [the MTC Order], the [applicant] submits as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">[…] the Order is immaterial to [the applicant’s] counterclaim concerning [the respondent’s] breach of its due diligence obligations. Such obligations are based on the MOA, which requires [the respondent] to ‘<span class="font-italic">cooperate with [the applicant] and provide all the necessary documents and information to [the applicant]</span>’. [The respondent] breached its due diligence obligations by failing to provide all the necessary documents to [the applicant], notably the [STB]. [The respondent] never denied at the time that [the applicant] had a right to access the STB under the MOA, and instead only contended (implausibly) that it was unable to provide the STB because it was with its external counsel.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">[Majority’s emphasis in Final Award]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">C. <span class="font-weight-bold">[Respondent’s] submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">618. The [respondent] submits that it acted in accordance with the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">619. The [respondent] submits that the [applicant] lost its right to conduct due diligence on or around 30 June 2016 when it committed ‘numerous breaches of Section 1 of the MOA.’ In this regard, the [respondent] argues that [the MTC Order] supports the [respondent’s] argument that the [applicant] lost the right to become a stockholder of [the respondent] because it did not comply with all of its obligations under the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">620. Notwithstanding that the [applicant] lost the right to conduct due diligence as this right was conditional on the [applicant] performing its own obligations under the MOA, the [respondent] submits that it complied with its due diligence obligation under the MOA. According to the [respondent], it provided all documents the [applicant] asked for (including the loan agreements), except for the [STB], which the [respondent] simply requested that the [applicant] defer its request so that the [respondent] could seek legal advice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">621. The [respondent] also avers that the [applicant] never became a stockholder of the [respondent] because the [applicant] did not comply with its obligations under the MOA. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">D. <span class="font-weight-bold">Tribunal’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">622. The [applicant’s] final case on the [respondent’s] alleged breaches of the MOA has become thinner as these proceedings have advanced. By the end, the [applicant’s] submissions focus on three alleged breaches of the MOA by the [respondent]. As the MOA has been validly rescinded and the [applicant] is not claiming any damages in relation to the [respondent’s] alleged breaches, this topic is somewhat moot.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">623. As explained above (see Issue 1), the MOA provided that all obligations were to be performed by the Parties in three (3) stages. Each stage had its own deadline, and according to Section 4 of the MOA, ‘[a]ll proposed Stages would ultimately be conditional on satisfaction of all steps unless all parties agree to a variation in writing’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">624. The due diligence obligations are set forth in stage 2 per the MOA. The [Majority] shares the conclusion of the [MTC Order] that the [applicant] lost its right to rely on any rights pursuant to stage 2 per the MOA, as it did not comply with the other obligations under stage 1 per the MOA. Therefore, the [Majority] rejects the [applicant’s] claim that the [respondent] breached the MOA by failing to comply with its due diligence obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">625. In the same vein, the [Majority] was not persuaded by the [applicant’s] submission that the [respondent] breached the MOA by failing to ‘reflect [the applicant’s] ownership of a 42% stake in [the respondent] in the most cost-effective and expeditious way.’ This obligation is stated as part of stage 1 per the MOA but it is inherently connected to the other stages per the MOA, which, for example under stage 2, require the [respondent] to cooperate with the [applicant’s] due diligence. The [respondent] clearly did the first step of complying with its obligation by entering into the Subscription Agreement in light of stage 1 per the MOA. However, as the [applicant] had breached its obligations under the MOA, the [respondent] was entitled to rescind the MOA and cancel the Subscription Agreement. In light of the [applicant’s] breaches of the MOA, the [Majority] considers that the [respondent] cannot be regarded as the Party that breached the MOA by failing to ‘reflect [the applicant’s] ownership of a 42% stake in [the respondent]’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">626. Finally, as explained by the [Majority] under Issue 1 above, both Parties did not comply with the deadline for negotiating the shareholders’ agreement pursuant to Section 2 of the MOA. Therefore, the [Majority] finds it inappropriate to hold that the [respondent] breached the duty to negotiate the shareholders’ agreement (see also Issue 21 below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The reference to “Issue 21 below” in [626] of the Award was clearly a typographical error which should have referred to Issue 22.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 <span class="font-italic">Issue 22</span> was whether the respondent breached the JVA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The Majority noted that before the hearing in September 2019, the applicant had submitted that the respondent had breached the JVA by: (a) refusing the applicant’s demand to be named as co-permittee; (b) ignoring the applicant’s right to be the authorised operator and/or exclusive driller of the JV; (c) refusing the applicant’s demand to receive an additional 6% in the JV; and (d) by violating the Philippine Constitution and various provisions of Philippine law.

In determining what was within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration, the court will have regard to five sources, being the pleadings, the agreed list of issues, opening statements, the evidence that was adduced in the arbitration and closing submissions: <span class="font-italic">CDM and another v CDP </span>[2021] 2 SLR 235 (“<span class="font-italic">CDM</span>”) at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 A “practical view” must be taken in identifying the substance of the dispute that was referred to arbitration: <span class="font-italic">Prometheus Marine Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita and another appeal </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1 at [58]. An assessment of whether an arbitral award should be set aside for deciding any issue not referred to the arbitral tribunal for determination by the parties is a two-stage inquiry. The first stage is to identify matters that were within the scope of submission to the tribunal. The second stage is determining whether the award involved matters outside that scope or involving a “new difference” outside that scope: <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [40] and [44].

In so far as the right to be heard is concerned, the failure of an arbitrator to refer every point for decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for challenge. Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous evidence, or adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence adduced by the parties, or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant, might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. … the overriding burden on the applicant is to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) It is almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute. They may expect the arbitrator to select one of these alternative positions. The arbitrator, however, is not bound to adopt an either/or approach. He is perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based on evidence that is before him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The principle of minimal curial intervention should be balanced against the parties’ right to define the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal: <span class="font-italic">GD Midea Air Conditioning Equipment Co </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Tornado Consumer Goods Ltd and another matter</span> [2018] 4 SLR 271 at [56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 An issue that is raised in a party’s pleadings “remains in play throughout the arbitration” unless it is “expressly withdrawn” and “no matter how weakly the party may actually advance it”: <span class="font-italic">CDM </span>at [20(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 768 at [150]. However, the question of whether the issue remains in play will be assessed by the court having regard to the five sources referred to above and all the circumstances of what occurred between the parties during the arbitration including whether the issue was ever advanced or dealt with, even weakly, by either party. In instances where a party raises an issue in its pleadings and/or opening submissions but subsequently “lets it lie” and neither party addresses it further, it will be necessary for the court to assess whether in all the circumstances of the particular case it has been withdrawn or abandoned: <span class="font-italic">Sugar Australia Pty Limited v Mackay Sugar Ltd</span> [2012] QSC 38; <span class="font-italic">OAO Northern Shipping Co v Remolcadores de Marin SL </span>(<span class="font-italic">The Remmar</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2007] EWHC 1821 (Comm); <span class="font-italic">William Hare UAE LLC v Aircraft Support Industries Pty Ltd</span> [2014] NSWSC 1403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As there is no right of appeal from an international arbitral award the court must resist engaging with what is substantially an appeal on the legal merits of an arbitral award, but presented as a challenge to process failures during an arbitration: <span class="font-italic">AKN </span><span class="font-italic">and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 at [38]–[39].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 An arbitral tribunal has a wide discretion in making case management decisions and a court will not revisit such decisions in a setting aside application unless such decisions breach the rules of natural justice, including depriving a party of a reasonable opportunity to be heard: <span class="font-italic">Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd </span>[2015]<span class="font-italic"> </span>1 SLR 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Triulzi Cesare</span>”) at [131]–[132].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Article 18 of the Model Law provides that the parties shall be treated “with equality” and given a full opportunity of presenting their cases. The term “with equality” is to be “interpreted reasonably in regulating the procedural aspects of the arbitration”. It does not require that the parties are to be treated identically. A tribunal (and a court on an application to set aside an arbitral award) is not concerned with whether or not equal time or equal numbers of pleadings or submissions are made by each party: <span class="font-italic">Triulzi Cesare </span>at [112].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of scope</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 It is appropriate to review the five sources to which reference has been made in these principles to determine the scope of the issues submitted to the Tribunal for decision relevant to the aspects of the Award that the applicant claims are beyond the scope of what was submitted to the Tribunal.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 The question of the respondent’s entitlement to rescission could only arise if the applicant was found to be in breach of the MOA. The applicant was asking the Tribunal not to reward the respondent with the remedy of rescission for the applicant’s breach because it claimed that the respondent was also in breach. Had the Tribunal acceded to such a submission it would have found that both parties were in breach and would have had to decide whether in the circumstances of the respondent’s breach it should be precluded from the remedy of rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 This was not a disjunctive case. It was clearly a claim that both parties were “equally” in breach and the remedy should not be permitted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Although the applicant had deployed Art 1192 in its Written Opening Submissions, it is obvious that it did not pursue it any further. It certainly did not ask the Tribunal to apply it if in accordance with its submissions, the Tribunal found that the respondent was in breach of the MOA. Rather it rested its case and submissions on an outcome that, if the Tribunal found that the applicant was in breach of the MOA and the respondent was also in breach, it would not allow the respondent to rescind the MOA. It ran the risk of the Tribunal accepting its submission that the respondent was in breach but deciding that notwithstanding such breach the remedy of rescission was still available. As it happened the Majority found that the respondent was not relevantly in breach of the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 The applicant was able to put and argue its case fully as to why the respondent should not be entitled to rescission. As discussed above, it identified various aspects of the respondent’s conduct that it relied upon to suggest that it was in breach of the MOA and should not be rewarded with the remedy of rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 After due consideration of all those submissions the Majority determined that the applicant was in breach of the MOA by failing to remit US$200,000 to the JV Fund (Issue 2) and by failing to provide the necessary information to the respondent on the Surface Rights (Issue 4). The Majority determined that the applicant was not in breach of the MOA for failing to negotiate the terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement (Issue 1) and thus this was not considered as a basis for rescission of the MOA. The Majority determined that it was inappropriate to hold that the respondent was in breach of the MOA by <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> failing to negotiate the Shareholders’ Agreement (Issue 21). In those circumstances it did not find that both parties were in breach of the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 The parties’ submissions before the Tribunal utilised the language of “breach” of the MOA rather than whether there was a “failure or refusal to abide by the” MOA.

The applicant contended that the conclusions reached by the Majority were effectively dictated by the structure that it chose for the Award. Emphasis was placed on the fact that it was not until the latter part of the reasoning in the Award in Issue 21 that the Tribunal gave any consideration to whether the respondent had been in breach of the MOA. It submitted that it failed to consider this matter appropriately because it had already decided that the respondent was entitled to rescind the MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 A reasonable reading of the Award as a whole demonstrates that the Majority did not cocoon itself in each separate Issue or fail to give proper and global consideration to all the matters before it for determination. Rather it is clear that it had regard to its findings in various sections of the Award and in some instances cross-referenced those findings. It is appropriate to identify some examples. In dealing with Issue 2 the Majority, at [226] of the Award, referred to the matters that were to be addressed under Issue 5.

In [625] the Majority recorded its rejection of the applicant’s claim that the respondent had breached the MOA by failing to reflect the applicant’s ownership of the 42% stake in the respondent concluding that because the applicant had breached its obligations under the MOA and by implication from the language used by the Majority the respondent had not breached its obligations under the MOA, the respondent was entitled to cancel the Subscription Agreement that had been executed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 The Majority’s conclusion recorded in [625] that: “In light of the” applicant’s “breaches of the MOA, the Tribunal considers that the” respondent “cannot be regarded as the Party that breached the MOA by failing to ‘reflect …’” the applicant’s “ownership of a 42% stake in” the respondent, follows immediately upon the reasoning referred to above and must be understood in that context. This was not, as the applicant would have it a “bizarre” and curious outcome. Nor was it the application of a “deeming principle”. It is a statement of a conclusion reached in circumstances where the Majority found that the applicant was in breach of its obligations under the MOA, the respondent was not in breach, and the respondent could not (“cannot”)

</div> The applicant submitted that the Surface Rights Email was relevant to its defence that it could not be considered in breach of the MOA when it was the first to initiate negotiations on the transfer of Surface Rights at cost, plus a modest premium, by sending the spreadsheet to the respondent on 23 June 2016. That defence alleged that the respondent took no initiative to negotiate the transfer and failed to explain why the spreadsheet was insufficient. It submitted that if the respondent was truly intent on engaging in good faith discussions, it should have at least requested the applicant to furnish information that the respondent considered was missing from that which it had provided and it did not do so. The applicant submitted that the material in the Surface Rights Email was relevant to these issues.

The arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”), by a majority (“the Majority”), found in favour of the respondent and dismissed the counterclaims brought by the applicant, CIP. In its application before this court, the applicant sought to set aside the award issued by the Majority (“the Award”) on the grounds that the Majority had decided issues which were beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to the arbitration and that the Tribunal had breached the rules of natural justice.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The applicant and the respondent were parties to a joint venture agreement (“JVA”). The purpose of the joint-venture (“JV”) was to develop a mining project (“the Project”) in the Philippines. The respondent had obtained the requisite exploration permit (“EP”) from the Philippines Mines and Geosciences Bureau (“MGB”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Under the JVA, the applicant could acquire a 36% interest in the JV. The JVA also provided for the parties to enter into good faith discussions to convert the applicant’s interest in the JV into equity in the respondent. A subsequent Memorandum of Understanding gave the applicant the right to acquire an additional 6% interest in the JV. One related issue which arose was that the applicant wanted to be named as a “co-permittee” in the EP, as it took the view that it had become a 42% shareholder of the respondent. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Another issue that arose during the parties’ working relationship was the ownership of rights that the applicant had acquired to the land (“the Surface Rights”) within the Project zone, the subject of the JV operations. The applicant had acquired some Surface Rights within the Project zone and the respondent subsequently claimed that these acquisitions were secretive and inconsistent with the applicant’s obligations to the JV. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Another issue between the parties in relation to their respective obligations was the requirement for the applicant to pay certain outstanding amounts into the JV fund.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 By mid-2015, it was necessary for the EP to be renewed. An application for its renewal was lodged with the MGB on 5 May 2015. However, for various reasons, the EP expired on 11 July 2015. The applicant then suspended all drilling operations and the Project stalled.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">The Memorandum of Agreement</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 In 2016, the parties reached a compromise in respect of the issues that had arisen between them and entered into a Memorandum of Agreement dated 10 June 2016 (“the MOA”). The parties agreed to take steps in three stages within different time frames for specified purposes.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 In Stage 1, Section 1 of the MOA, the respondent undertook to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding in the respondent. The parties agreed to provide full transparency and accounting in respect of the Surface Rights and the applicant agreed to transfer those that it had acquired to the respondent at cost plus a modest premium. These and other steps were agreed to be taken “upon the signing” of the MOA until 30 June 2016.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 In Stage 2, Section 2 of the MOA, the respondent agreed to assist the applicant to complete its due diligence of the respondent. The parties also agreed to negotiate a shareholders’ agreement (“the Shareholders’ Agreement”) in respect of the respondent’s shares. These and other steps were agreed to be taken “within 45 days” of the signing of the MOA.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 In Stage 3, Section 3 of the MOA, the parties agreed to take various other further steps “within 3 months” from the signing of the MOA.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Section 4 of the MOA provided that all the “proposed Stages would ultimately be conditional on satisfaction of all steps unless all parties agree to a variation in writing”.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Rescission of MOA and termination of JVA</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The parties’ relationship soured during the due diligence process with each making claims against the other of failures to comply with their respective obligations under the MOA.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 In December 2016, the respondent informed the applicant that it was rescinding the MOA. In March 2017, the respondent elected to terminate the JVA and commenced the Arbitration shortly thereafter.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Tribunal’s proceedings and findings</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 There were some preliminary applications and rulings before the substantive oral hearings before the Tribunal which took place on 16 to 20 September 2019 (both dates inclusive). In October 2019, the applicant applied to introduce new evidence, “the Surface Rights Email”. The Tribunal rejected this application. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 In early 2020, the Tribunal sought clarification from the parties in respect of some issues relating to the nature of the alleged breaches of the MOA and clarification from the applicant on whether it was abandoning certain arguments and claims in its counterclaim. The respondent requested an oral hearing to make submissions on this issue. The further oral hearing was held on 1 April 2020 (“the Further Oral Hearing”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The Award was published on 21 August 2020.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The Majority held the applicant in breach of the MOA and JVA and dismissed the applicant’s counterclaims. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The Majority found that the applicant had breached of the MOA by: (a) failing to remit US$200,000 to the JV; and (b) failing to provide the necessary information to the respondent on the Surface Rights and to negotiate the transfer price and sale of the Surface Rights. It had also breached the JVA by, among other things, asking to be named as a co-permittee under the EP, failing to contribute its share of the JV’s expenditures, refusing to negotiate the conversion of its 36% interest in the JV into equity in the respondent and preventing the resumption of drilling when the EP had expired.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 Besides an award of damages, the Majority ordered the applicant to provide “complete information” in respect of the Surface Rights to the respondent and transfer them to the respondent “at cost”.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The Majority rejected the claims that the respondent had breached the MOA. In respect of the respondent’s obligations under Section 2 of the MOA to assist the applicant in its due diligence, the Majority accepted that the applicant lost the right to rely on these rights in Section 2 as it had failed to comply with its own obligations under Section 1. The Majority found that the respondent had not breached the MOA by failing to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding expeditiously. It also concluded that as both parties had not negotiated the Shareholders’ Agreement by the stipulated deadline, neither party was in breach of the MOA in this regard. The applicant abandoned a number of its claims during the Arbitration, including its claim that the respondent had breached the JVA. The Majority held that the applicant was not entitled to any relief. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The setting aside application</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 Before this court, the applicant contended that the Award should be set aside, pursuant to s 24 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) and Articles 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, on four grounds. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 It submitted that the Award contained decisions that were: (a) beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to the Arbitration; and (b) made without giving the applicant a full opportunity to present its case and respond. These decisions were that: (a) the respondent was entitled to rescind the MOA even though both the applicant and the respondent had failed or refused to abide by the MOA (“Ground 1”); (b) the respondent could not be regarded as the party that breached the MOA in light of the applicant’s breaches (“Ground 2”); and (c) the applicant was to transfer the Surface Rights to the respondent at cost (“the Surface Rights Order”) (“Ground 4”). The applicant also claimed that the uneven application of procedural rules between the parties, particularly the Tribunal’s failure to allow the applicant to adduce the Surface Rights Email in evidence, breached the rules of natural justice (“Ground 3”).</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s judgment</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 In determining what was within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration, the court would have regard to five sources, being the pleadings, the agreed list of issues, opening statements, the evidence that was adduced in the arbitration and closing submissions (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">15</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Ground 1</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 The Majority had not found that both parties were in breach of the MOA (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[240]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25 The fact that the articles in the Civil Code of the Philippines (“the Civil Code”) upon which each of the parties relied referred to <span class="font-italic">one</span> <span class="font-italic">party</span> breaching and the counterparty being in a position to act upon the breach did not shut out the Tribunal from considering all the circumstances surrounding each party’s conduct and consequences of that conduct (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[232]</span>).  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">26 In its List of Issues, the applicant had identified the issue of whether, if the Tribunal were to find that the respondent breached the MOA, it should allow the respondent to be “rewarded” with rescission. Clearly, any consideration of whether rescission would be “rewarded” would be in the context of the applicant having committed a breach of the MOA and thus the Tribunal would be considering a circumstance of both parties being in breach of the MOA. This was not a disjunctive case. It was clearly a claim that both parties were “equally” in breach and the remedy should not be permitted (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[235]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[237]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">27 In its Written Opening Submissions in the Arbitration, the applicant had also identified a provision in the Civil Code, Art 1192, which provided for consequences if both parties breached their obligations. By not pursuing this article in the remainder of the Arbitration, the applicant ran the risk of the Tribunal accepting its submission that the respondent was in breach but deciding that notwithstanding such breach the remedy of rescission was still available (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[238]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">28 The Tribunal did not stray into issues that were not submitted to it for determination. Nor did it deny the applicant the opportunity to make submissions on the relevant issue (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[242]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">29 Ground 1 of the applicant’s challenge failed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Ground 2</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">30 The order in which the Majority had decided the issues did not dictate the conclusions it reached. A reasonable reading of the Award as a whole demonstrated that the Majority did not cocoon itself in each separate issue or fail to give proper and global consideration to all the matters before it for determination (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[252]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">31 The Majority had not applied some “deeming principle” that because the applicant had breached the MOA, the respondent could not itself have been in breach. The Majority’s conclusion that the respondent had not breached the MOA by failing to reflect the applicant’s 42% shareholding in the respondent followed from its earlier reasoning that because the applicant had breached its obligations in Section 1 of the MOA and the respondent had not, the former was not entitled to rely on its rights in Section 2 of the MOA (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[255]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[256]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">32 Ground 2 of the applicant’s challenge failed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Ground 3</span> </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">33 The applicant had been given a full opportunity to make an application to tender the Surface Rights Email and ample opportunity to make submissions in support of that tender. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had properly explained its failure to disclose the Surface Rights Email before the oral hearing. The applicant had explicitly acknowledged that it had control and possession of the Surface Rights Email before the hearing. The Tribunal also concluded that the prejudice that might be caused to the respondent could not be cured at the advanced stage of the proceedings (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[284]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[285]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">34 In any event, the documents within the Surface Rights Email could not reasonably have made a difference to the Majority’s deliberations (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[289]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">35 Further, the Tribunal had not breached the rules of natural justice by allowing the respondent to amend its Memorial. The Tribunal had provided each party with the opportunity to put its arguments as to whether the amendment should be permitted. Both parties took up those opportunities and neither before nor after the amendment was allowed did the applicant raise with the Tribunal that it had been prejudiced by the amendment or disadvantaged in arguing its case before the Tribunal (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[303]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">36 There was also no breach of natural justice by the Tribunal’s admission of three new exhibits by the respondent before the oral hearing commenced. The applicant had not opposed the admission of these new exhibits and the Tribunal had applied itself appropriately to the respondent’s application (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[312]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[314]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">37 Further, the Tribunal’s decision to hold the Further Oral Hearing did not breach the rules of natural justice as both parties were given a full opportunity to make submissions as to whether a further hearing should take place. At the Further Oral Hearing, both parties were given a full opportunity to make every submission they wished to make (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[321]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">38 That the Tribunal acceded to 48 of the respondent’s 129 requests for document production but none of the applicant’s 93 requests did not evidence a breach of natural justice. Although the respondent was clearly more successful than the applicant in its applications for the production of documents, that fact alone cannot be equated to a finding that equality of treatment was lacking (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[333]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">39 Ground 3 of the applicant’s challenge failed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Ground 4</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">40 The Surface Rights Order was a matter that was submitted to the Tribunal for determination. It was an order that was sought by the respondent at the outset of the Arbitration and was the subject of evidence and submissions (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[354]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">41 The Majority concluded that the applicant had breached not only <br/>the JVA but also its fiduciary and trustee duties to act in the interests of the JV and to act in good faith. It then crafted the remedy that it concluded flowed from those breaches which included the Surface Rights Order (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[355]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">42 Ground 4 of the applicant’s challenge failed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
