        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the defendant in the main
                    action (“Siemens AG”) against the decision of the judge in
                    chambers (“the Judge”) granting the plaintiff
                    (“Holdrich”) leave to serve the originating process out of
                    jurisdiction. The Judge’s grounds of decision are reported in <em>Holdrich Investment Ltd v Siemens AG</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 1237 (“the GD”). We dismissed the appeal after
                    hearing oral arguments and now give our reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The requirements which must be met before the
                    court will grant leave for service out of jurisdiction are well settled. For
                    present purposes, it is sufficient to adopt the three major considerations
                    stated by Prof Jeffery Pinsler SC in <em>Singapore
                        Court Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 11/2/5.
                    First, the claim must come within the scope of one or more of the paragraphs of
                    O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed). Second, the claim must have a sufficient degree of merit. Third, Singapore
                    must be the <em>forum conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the court below, Holdrich sought and obtained
                    leave for service out of jurisdiction in an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application heard by an assistant registrar. The service
                    out of jurisdiction was resisted by Siemens AG, who succeeded in having the
                    order set aside in an <em>inter partes</em> application
                    heard by another assistant registrar on the ground that Singapore was not the
                        <em>forum conveniens</em> or natural forum for trying
                    the substantive dispute between the parties. The second assistant registrar also
                    found that there had been material non-disclosure on the part of Holdrich when
                    it applied for leave for service out of jurisdiction, but that finding was not
                    pertinent to the disposal of this appeal. Holdrich then appealed to the Judge,
                    who held that Singapore was the <em>forum conveniens</em>
                    and, accordingly, reinstated the grant of leave for service out of
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On appeal to this court, the focus was likewise
                    on the issue of <em>forum conveniens</em>; Siemens AG
                    did not dispute that the first and second considerations referred to in
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above were satisfied. Mr Gregory
                    Vijayendran, on behalf of Siemens AG, made two preliminary points. First,
                    he argued that, as a matter of approach, a Singapore court deciding the issue of
                        <em>forum conveniens</em> should compare all the
                    connecting factors pointing towards Singapore against all the connecting factors
                    pointing away from Singapore. We were unable to agree that that was the right
                    way of addressing the issue. The purpose of the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em> analysis is to identify the most appropriate forum in
                    which to try the substantive dispute. It is wrong to say that Singapore is
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> simply because the
                    connecting factors which point to Singapore are outweighed by all the connecting
                    factors which point away from Singapore. The connecting factors which point away
                    from Singapore must point to a more appropriate forum than Singapore, and they
                    might not do so if those connections are dispersed amongst several
                    jurisdictions. Quite simply, Singapore is <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> only if there is a more appropriate forum than
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Vijayendran next argued that the Judge
                    wrongly directed himself on the burden of proof when he stated the issue before
                    him to be “whether Singapore [was] forum non conveniens, because if it
                    [was], then the appeal should be dismissed, and vice versa” (see [2] of
                    the GD). Mr Vijayendran correctly pointed out that Lord Goff of
                    Chieveley, in his leading speech in <em>Spiliada Maritime
                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460
                        (“<em>Spiliada</em>”), the <em>locus classicus</em> in this area, held (at 480) that a
                    plaintiff who sought leave for service out of jurisdiction bore the burden of
                    proving that the court from which leave was sought was the <em>forum conveniens</em>, whereas a defendant who resisted service
                    within jurisdiction bore the burden of proving that the court whose jurisdiction
                    was being resisted was <em>forum non conveniens</em>.
                    Mr Vijayendran also referred to various instances in Lord Goff’s
                    speech where his Lordship spoke of the need to show that the court in question
                    was “clearly”
                    <em>forum conveniens</em> or <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>, as the case might be (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Spiliada</em> at 481). The short
                    answer to Mr Vijayendran’s argument is that any error which the Judge
                    might have made as regards the burden of proof is immaterial given his finding,
                    which he pronounced immediately after stating the issue before him in the manner
                    indicated above, that “Singapore was <em>clearly</em> the more appropriate forum” [emphasis added] (see
                    [2] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We would make the following further observations
                    on the burden of proof point. The existence of a fact which shows that a
                    jurisdiction is the <em>forum conveniens</em> or <em>vice versa</em> is a question of fact, and the party who
                    alleges the fact bears the burden of proving it. In contrast, the question of
                    whether, on a given set of facts, a jurisdiction is <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> or <em>vice versa</em> is a
                    question of law, albeit not a general question since the answer necessarily
                    depends on, and is confined to, that particular set of facts. The reason why the
                    cases refer, perhaps confusingly, to the burden of proving that a particular
                    jurisdiction is <em>forum conveniens</em> or <em>forum non conveniens</em> is this. The jurisdiction of the
                    court is, in the first place, territorial, as reflected in the expression
                    “within jurisdiction”, which neatly fuses the territorial and
                    juridical elements (see J J Fawcett &amp; J M Carruthers,
                        <em>Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett: Private International
                        Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 14th Ed, 2008) at p 354).
                    At the same time, the law in this and other jurisdictions has come to recognise
                    that the physical location of a defendant may not be a decisive or even material
                    consideration in deciding whether or not the court should exercise jurisdiction
                    over a dispute – Lord Goff in <em>Spiliada</em>
                    gave (at 481) the example of a defendant whose place of residence was no more
                    than a tax haven, and commented that “no great importance should be
                    attached” to the defendant’s place of residence in such a
                    scenario.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However, in recognition of the primarily
                    territorial nature of the court’s jurisdiction, the court begins with the
                    location of the defendant when it decides whether it has jurisdiction over a
                    dispute – thus, jurisdiction over a defendant who is within the territory
                    is as of right, while jurisdiction over a defendant who is outside the territory
                    is discretionary. In this sense, there is a burden –
                    <em>viz</em>, the burden of displacing the <em>prima facie</em> weight given to the location of the
                    defendant. But, despite the use of the term, the burden is not strictly one of
                    proof. Instead, the burden is one of demonstrating the normative weight to be
                    given to each connecting factor in the light of all the circumstances of the
                    case. The ease of discharging the burden would similarly depend on the facts of
                    each case – again, as Lord Goff himself noted in <em>Spiliada</em> (at 481), the circumstances described in the English
                    equivalent of our O 11 r 1 are “of great variety, ranging from
                    cases where … the discretion would normally be exercised in favour of
                    granting leave … to cases where the grant of leave is far more
                    problematical”. In the same vein, Lord Goff also remarked (at 481)
                    that the importance to be attached to any particular ground invoked by the
                    plaintiff in seeking leave for service out of jurisdiction might vary from case
                    to case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Separately, we do not think that it is necessary
                    for a plaintiff who seeks leave for service out of jurisdiction to show that
                    Singapore is “clearly” the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em> if, by this, it is meant that Singapore must be not
                    only the most appropriate forum in the final analysis, but also the most
                    appropriate forum by far. No doubt, there will be cases where the <em>forum conveniens</em> is clear beyond contest. But, in the
                    case of an international dispute where the connecting factors are finely
                    balanced, a <em>requirement</em> that there must be a forum
                    which is <em>clearly</em> the most appropriate forum would
                    necessarily condemn the dispute to jurisdictional limbo. Such a result does the
                    doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> no credit. In our
                    view, therefore, it is sufficient for a plaintiff seeking leave for service out
                    of jurisdiction to show that Singapore is, on balance and in the final analysis,
                    the most appropriate forum to try the dispute, and it matters not whether
                    Singapore is the most appropriate forum by a hair or by a mile.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In this case, the connecting factors point to
                    diverse jurisdictions. Siemens AG was incorporated in Germany and has its
                    principal place of business there, while Holdrich was incorporated in Hong Kong
                    and has its principal place of business there. The parties’ dispute in the
                    main action arises from a consultancy agreement entered into between the parties
                    on 21 August 2003 (“the Consultancy Agreement”), whereby
                    Siemens AG agreed to pay commission to Holdrich for its consultancy
                    services if orders were “received by SIEMENS”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> from certain entities in Sweden,
                    Israel, Austria and India. The Consultancy Agreement was later amended to remove
                    Israel and to include the Nordic regions, and was thereafter amended again to
                    include Indonesia. It was expressed to be governed by Singapore law; there was,
                    however, no express choice of forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In its statement of claim, Holdrich is
                    claiming commission in respect of its services in helping to secure a contract
                    between two Indonesian entities, <em>viz</em>,
                    PT Hutchinson CP Telecommunications and PT Siemens Indonesia. The main
                    issue is whether Holdrich is entitled to commission when contracts are concluded
                    with members of the Siemens group (in this case, PT Siemens Indonesia)
                    other than Siemens AG itself. Holdrich says “yes”, and, in
                    support of its claim, refers to correspondence from an employee of Siemens
                    Network GmbH &amp; Co, KG (“Siemens GmbH”), which, according
                    to Holdrich, amounted to an admission of liability on behalf of Siemens AG.
                    Siemens AG says “no”, and proposes to call two of its
                    ex-employees to explain the context in which the Consultancy Agreement was
                    concluded. Siemens AG also intends to call the employee of
                    Siemens GmbH who is said to have made the admission of liability. These
                    persons are said to be located in Germany. There was some mention before the
                    Judge of the need to call witnesses from the two Indonesian entities, but this
                    was not emphasised by either side on appeal. In addition, Dr Ingo Gehring,
                    a senior legal counsel of Siemens AG, deposed that Siemens AG is
                    currently being investigated by German public prosecutors in relation to
                    possibly illegal agreements including the Consultancy Agreement. No further
                    details were given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Against this factual backdrop,
                    Mr Vijayendran raised several practical points which he said militated in
                    favour of Germany as the <em>forum conveniens</em>. He said
                    that the two ex-employees proposed to be called by Siemens AG as witnesses
                    were located in Germany, and the same applied to the documentary evidence
                    proposed to be adduced by Siemens AG. He also mentioned that there would be
                    a need for Siemens AG’s evidence to be translated into English if
                    that evidence were to be received by a Singapore court. We were unable to attach
                    much significance to these points. The physical location of witnesses is no
                    longer a vital or even very material consideration with the advent of video-link
                    technology (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Peters
                        Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 381
                    at sub-para (e) of [26] and [27]). This applies <em>a
                        fortiori</em> to the physical location of documents. The translation
                    point which Mr Vijayendran raised was at best ambivalent or neutral since
                    it was not suggested that translation would pose insuperable difficulties, and
                    since there would also be a need for Holdrich’s evidence to be translated
                    if the trial were to take place in Germany. We also took note of the fact that
                    the Consultancy Agreement and the documentary evidence exhibited thus far,
                    including the documents emanating from Siemens AG itself, are all in
                    English, thus suggesting that English is the <em>lingua
                        franca</em> of the parties and that, if anything, an English-speaking
                    forum is preferable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With regard to the ongoing investigations by
                    German public prosecutors into Siemens AG’s agreements (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), in the absence of further details, we
                    were unable to make anything out of the fact that such investigations are
                    currently underway. Nothing specific was shown as to how the outcome of the
                    German investigations would impact the civil claim in the Singapore proceedings.
                    The point was also made that the German authorities might not release the
                    documents which were held by them. This was purely speculative and no real
                    reasons were addressed to us as to why that would be so or why the German
                    authorities would not allow copies of documents in their possession to be made
                    for the purposes of foreign proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It seemed clear to us that the only factor
                    which decisively connected both parties and their dispute to a jurisdiction was
                    the parties’ choice of Singapore law as the governing law for the
                    Consultancy Agreement. In this regard Mr N Sreenivasan argued on
                    behalf of Holdrich that “in the absence of any express choice of
                    jurisdiction, [the] choice of Singapore law [was] an implied choice of Singapore
                        jurisdiction”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On the other hand,
                    Mr Vijayendran argued that specifying a choice of governing law was not
                    quite the same as specifying a choice of forum, not least because the parties to
                    a contract might stop short of selecting a jurisdiction as the forum for dispute
                    resolution on top of selecting that jurisdiction’s law as the governing
                    law of the contract precisely because they did not want to litigate in that
                    jurisdiction. While we thought that Mr Sreenivasan might have overstated
                    his argument on this point and that the general proposition made by
                    Mr Vijayendran was to be preferred, this would still leave the court with
                    the task of deciding the weight to be given to the parties’ choice of
                    governing law in all the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In our view, since the connecting factors to
                    other jurisdictions were ambivalent in the present case, the parties’
                    choice of Singapore law as the governing law of the Consultancy Agreement must
                    necessarily and inevitably assume a greater degree of importance.
                    Mr Vijayendran took a contrary view, arguing that the choice of Singapore
                    law was of limited weight since there were only factual issues in dispute. We
                    disagreed. As we mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above), the main issue between the parties is whether the Consultancy Agreement
                    extends to contracts obtained by members of the Siemens group other than
                    Siemens AG itself. This is either a question of contractual interpretation
                    or a question on the implication of a term in fact. Both are mixed questions of
                    fact and law – the context in which the Consultancy Agreement was
                    concluded is a question of fact, while the interpretation to be accorded to that
                    agreement and the terms (if any) to be implied in the light of that context
                    involve questions of law which are to be answered with reference to the
                    principles governing the interpretation of contracts and the implication of
                    contractual terms. We hasten to add that these principles are, of course, not so
                    unique or difficult that they can only be applied by a Singapore court. However,
                    we would reiterate the oft-emphasised point that in the absence of
                    countervailing circumstances, there is much to be said for a Singapore court
                    applying Singapore law, and likewise for a foreign court applying its own law
                    (see <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von
                        Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Rickshaw Investments</em>”) at [42] and <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 at [44]). As Prof Adrian Briggs observed,
                    when one jurisdiction seeks to apply the law of another, “there is always
                    a risk that too much will get lost in translation” (see “A Map or
                    a Maze: Jurisdiction and Choice of Law in the Court of Appeal” (2007)
                    11 SYBIL 123 at p 125).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this regard, the absence of any strong
                    connecting factors here other than the parties’ choice of Singapore law as
                    the governing law of the Consultancy Agreement can be contrasted with the
                    circumstances in the case relied on by Mr Vijayendran, <em>viz</em>, <em>Macsteel Commercial Holdings (Pty) Ltd
                        &amp; Anor v Thermasteel V (Canada) Inc &amp; Anor</em>
                    [1996] CLC 1403. In that case, the English Court of Appeal held that
                    the strong connections to the Canadian province of Ontario were not displaced
                    simply because English law was the proper law of the contract in issue. This was
                    especially so since Ontario was a common law jurisdiction and, therefore, the
                    Ontario courts would not, presumably, encounter any great difficulty in applying
                    English contract law. We think this was what Sir Thomas Bingham MR
                    (with whom Millett and Pill LJJ agreed) meant when he said (at
                    1407–1408):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In certain circumstances, as Lord Goff pointed out [in <em>Spiliada</em>], it [<em>ie</em>, the
                        parties’ choice of governing law] is a factor of importance, in
                        particular, where there is some distinction or some arguable distinction
                        between the law[s] of the two competing jurisdictions. But there is no
                        suggestion in the evidence that the law of England and the law of Ontario
                        are in any way different on the apparently straightforward issues raised by
                        this dispute. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The judge at first instance] wrongly, in my judgment, on the
                        facts of this case, attributed much too great weight to the choice of
                        English law in a matter in which no difference between the competing laws
                        was shown …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In contrast, the alternative forum here is
                    Germany, a <em>civil law</em> jurisdiction. In the absence
                    of more evidence than what has been shown to us, we cannot, with respect, say
                    that the German courts would be able to fluently apply Singapore law. In any
                    case, however fluent the German courts might be in applying Singapore law, it
                    would surely be far more appropriate for a Singapore court to apply Singapore
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Vijayendran also argued that the Judge
                    wrongly applied <em>Rickshaw Investments</em> when he held
                    (at [6] of the GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties had agreed on Singapore law as the governing law and this is
                        an important consideration even though there is no other connection to
                        Singapore. There are many instances today where parties from different
                        countries have decided on Singapore law as a neutral choice and due regard
                        must be given to this factor, as was done in Rickshaw Investments <em>…</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1">We did not agree with Mr Vijayendran on this
                        point. It was clear to us, reading the GD as a whole, that the Judge was, as
                        he should, deciding the <em>forum conveniens</em> issue
                        on the facts of the case, and was only referring – quite correctly
                        – to Rickshaw Investments as an example
                        of a case where choice of law issues were closely scrutinised in order to
                        decide a question of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Separately, Mr Vijayendran sought to
                    downplay the importance of the parties’ choice of Singapore law as the
                    governing law of the Consultancy Agreement by arguing that
                    Siemens GmbH’s authority to make admissions of liability on behalf of
                    Siemens AG was governed by German law. Mr Vijayendran did not press
                    this argument, and, in any event, we were unable to agree with it for two
                    reasons. First, the admissions of liability said to be made by Siemens GmbH
                    are, at best, only part of the circumstances to be taken into account in
                    determining how the Consultancy Agreement should be interpreted and what implied
                    terms (if any) should be read into it. Therefore, even assuming that German law
                    governs the question of Siemens GmbH’s authority to make admissions
                    of liability on Siemens AG’s behalf, it will still be of subsidiary
                    importance to Singapore law, which governs the overall questions of contractual
                    interpretation and implication of contractual terms. Second, we would think that
                    there is an argument to be made that, for the purposes of a contract, questions
                    of agency between the contracting parties ought also to be governed by the
                    proper law of the contract. However, given that (as just mentioned) German law
                    would in any case be of subsidiary importance to Singapore law, we do not
                    propose to express a concluded view on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We therefore agreed with the Judge that
                    Singapore was the <em>forum conveniens</em> and that
                    Holdrich should be granted leave for service out of jurisdiction. In concluding,
                    we would reiterate that the purpose of the <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> analysis is to identify the <em>most
                        appropriate</em> forum to hear the substantive dispute. It is not an
                    exercise in comparing the sheer number of connecting factors which point to this
                    or that jurisdiction. What matters is the weight to be given to each connecting
                    factor in the light of all the circumstances of the case. In a finely-balanced
                    case such as the present, a single connecting factor could well be decisive. It
                    is also well to remember that while the connecting factors may not always point
                    decisively to only one jurisdiction, there must in every case be a most
                    appropriate forum in which to try the dispute – as we said earlier, the
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine would be brought
                    into ridicule if it yields the result that an international dispute is stuck in
                    jurisdictional limbo because the connecting factors are finely balanced. In this
                    regard, it bears emphasis that while the analysis in a service out of
                    jurisdiction case must necessarily begin with the principle that the plaintiff
                    bears the burden of persuading the court that Singapore is the <em>forum conveniens</em>, this should not overly detain the
                    court as it engages in the exercise of identifying the most appropriate forum on
                    a close scrutiny of the facts before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal
                    with costs and the usual consequential orders. At the invitation of both
                    parties, we fixed the costs at $12,000 including disbursements.</p>
