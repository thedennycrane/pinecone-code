In HC/CWU 78 of 2022 (“CWU 78”), Mr Lim How Teck (“Lim”) seeks to wind up the Company on the ground that it is unable to pay its debts. Lim is the holder of an unsecured note issued by the Company, which the Company failed to redeem when the note fell due. The Company did not comply with a statutory demand issued by Lim’s lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Company opposes Lim’s application on the ground that he does not have standing to make the application. A no-action clause in the trust deed (which governs Lim’s unsecured note) permits only the bond trustee to take enforcement action against the Company unless it fails to comply with a direction to do so by noteholders holding not less than one-fifth in nominal amount of the unsecured notes outstanding (the “one-fifth nominal amount requirement”). It is undisputed that no such direction has been given to the trustee, although Lim has the support of a sufficient number of noteholders who satisfy the one-fifth nominal amount requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In HC/OA 96 of 2022 (“OA 96”), Laguna (relying on the same no-action clause) seeks a permanent anti-suit injunction to restrain Lim from instituting and/or continuing with proceedings against Laguna in breach of the terms of the trust deed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In 1991, the Company issued 1,800 non-interest bearing unsecured notes of $120,000 each, known as Laguna National Unsecured Notes 2021 Series A (the “Unsecured Notes”) to finance the development of the Club. It was a condition of membership in the Club that each member had to also purchase an Unsecured Note. The Unsecured Notes were to be redeemed by the Company on 11 June 2021 (the “Redemption Date”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Unsecured Notes were constituted by a trust deed dated 18 September 1991 (the “Trust Deed”)

However, no such direction in writing has been issued to the Trustee. Thus, the express exception in cl 8.3 (where the Trustee fails to act in accordance with such a direction) does not apply. Lim has explained that the Trustee’s conduct had affected his faith in the Trustee’s ability to act objectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Lim submits that, in addition to the express exception, cl 8.3 is also not applicable if the Trustee, by reason of conflict of interest or unjustifiable unwillingness, cannot properly pursue a remedy for holders of the Unsecured Notes (“Noteholders”): <span class="font-italic">Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC v CompuCredit Holdings Corp</span> 677 F.3d 1286 (2012) at 1294. Lim also relies on:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Feldbaum v McCrory Corp</span> 1992 WL 119095 (“<span class="font-italic">Feldbaum</span>”) in which the court held at [*6] that a no-action clause applies if the trustee is capable of satisfying its obligations; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Rabinowitz v Kaiser-Frazer Corp</span> 111 N.Y.S.2d 539 (1952) in which the court held at [*545] that a no-action clause does not apply if the trustee cannot faithfully and competently discharge its duty as a fiduciary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As explained in <span class="font-italic">Feldbaum</span> at [*6]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The primary purpose of a no-action clause is thus to protect issuers from the expense involved in defending lawsuits that are either frivolous or otherwise not in the economic interest of the corporation and its creditors. In protecting the issuer such clauses protect bondholders. They protect against the exercise of poor judgment by a single bondholder or a small group of bondholders, who might otherwise bring a suit against the issuer that most bondholders would consider not to be in their collective economic interest. In addition to providing protection against improvident litigation decisions, a no-action clause also protects against the risk of strike suits. Obviously the class features of any such suits make that prospect somewhat more likely and somewhat more risky to the issuer than it would otherwise be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No-action clauses address these twin problems by delegating the right to bring a suit enforcing rights of bondholders to the trustee, or to the holders of a substantial amount of bonds, and by delegating to the trustee the right to prosecute such a suit in the first instance. These clauses also ensure that the proceeds of any litigation actually prosecuted will be shared ratably by all bondholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The assumption, however, is that the trustee is capable of satisfying its obligations. I agree with Lim that a no-action clause cannot apply where the trustee would be placed in a position of conflict or if the trustee has shown unjustifiable unwillingness to act. The Company also does not dispute this principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In the present proceedings, Lim submits that cl 8.3 is not applicable because the Trustee (a) has demonstrated unjustifiable unwillingness to take action against the Company and/or (b) would be placed in a position of conflict if it were to take action to wind up the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Lim relies, in particular, on the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Condition 3 of the Second Schedule to the Trust Deed provides that the quorum for the passing of a Special Resolution was at least two noteholders (or proxies) holding “in the aggregate a clear majority in the nominal amount of the Unsecured Notes for the time being outstanding”. The Trustee took the view that the nominal amount outstanding included the nominal amount of Unsecured Notes held by the Company. As a result, there was no quorum for the passing of Special Resolutions at the 7 October Meeting. Lim argues that the Trustee’s view (that the Company was a holder of its own Unsecured Notes) was unsustainable and showed that the Trustee was formulating technical arguments in favour of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Condition 1 of the Second Schedule to the Trust Deed provides that the Trustee is entitled to “such indemnity as the Trustee may require against the cost of convening and holding” the 7 October Meeting. However, the Trustee had asked for a much wider indemnity against “all actions, proceedings, claims, demands, damage, loss and expenses including legal costs and all liabilities …arising out of or in connection with” convening the holding the 7 October Meeting. Lim argues that this, combined with the Trustee’s position on the quorum for Special Resolutions, affected his faith in the Trustee’s ability to act objectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Company’s Annual Report for financial year (“FY”) 2016 showed the following:

</div> Before me, counsel for the Company explained that the latter was an advance payment of licence fees. It is not clear whether the advance payment was an obligation under the licence agreement. In any event, it is recorded in the accounts as a non-trade amount due to the Company and the licensor was a company controlled by Peter Kwee. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The Trustee had a meeting with a director of the Company, on 17 November 2017. Peter Kwee told the Trustee that the sale price of the Lease and the licence fee were based on independent valuation reports. Lim takes issue with the Trustee’s reliance on Peter Kwee’s undertaking to provide continuing financial support and the Trustee’s failure to inquire into the circumstances behind the Assignment, especially since the Trustee has acknowledged that the Lease was critical to the Company’s operations.

</div> Lim questions how the Trustee could have satisfied itself, without more, that the Company would be able to redeem the Unsecured Notes. I also note that the Trustee has said that it became aware of the Assignment sometime in November 2017 after it reviewed the financial statements for FY2016.

</div> Lim argues that this was arguably an event of default since Peter Kwee’s statement indicated a material failure in respect of the Company’s obligation to honour the Unsecured Notes. Lim takes issue with the Trustee’s failure to act on Peter Kwee’s statement. The evidence before me does not show whether the Trustee informed the noteholders of Peter Kwee’s statement after the meeting on 17 November 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unjustifiable unwillingness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Lim submits that the Trustee’s past conduct shows unjustifiable unwillingness to take action against the Company. In my view, this is a non-starter. The question is whether the Trustee has shown unjustifiable unwillingness to perform its duties under the Trust Deed. In this case, the Trustee has confirmed that it will act if so directed in writing by noteholders who satisfy the one-fifth nominal amount requirement, in accordance with cl 8.2. In my view, it cannot be said that the Trustee is unjustifiably unwilling to carry out its duty in accordance with cl 8.2. Lim has simply refused to invoke cl 8.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I note that under cl 8.2, the Trustee has some discretion in that it does not have to comply with any such direction unless it is indemnified “to its satisfaction” against all actions, proceedings, claims and demands to which it may thereby render itself liable and all costs, charges, damages and expenses which it may incur by so doing. However, this does not mean that the Trustee can refuse to accept any indemnity offered and thereby refuse to comply with a direction that has been given. If the Trustee refuses to accept an indemnity (the scope of which is consistent with the language used in cl 8.2) without good reason, the Trustee’s refusal would trigger cl 8.3 and the no-action clause would cease to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, I should add the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Trustee’s view that the nominal amount outstanding included the nominal amount of Unsecured Notes held by the Company and which had not been cancelled (see [23(a)] above) was not unreasonable. As the Trustee explained (through its lawyers’ letter dated 7 December 2021),

</div>
</div> the definition of “outstanding” in the Trust Deed excludes Unsecured Notes which have been purchased by the Company only if they have been cancelled. In my opinion, the Trustee’s view is not evidence of unjustifiable unwillingness to act. Neither can it be said to be evidence of partiality towards the Company. The Trustee had simply acted in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Lim has also complained about the scope of the indemnity requested by the Trustee in relation to the 7 October Meeting (see [23(b)] above). The Trustee had in fact proceeded to convene the 7 October Meeting although it had not received the indemnity that it was entitled to. In my view, the fact that the Trustee’s subsequent request for an indemnity may have been wider than what it might have been entitled to does not show unjustifiable unwillingness on the Trustee’s part. The meeting had taken place and it was for Lim to object to the scope of the indemnity requested.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conflict of interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Lim submits that if the Trustee were the applicant in winding up proceedings against the Company, it would be placed in a position of conflict because it faces a potential claim by some noteholders for breach of its duties under the Trust Deed. In particular, Lim relies on the matters set out above in [23(c)] and [23(d)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The mere fact that the Trustee faces a potential claim by some noteholders does not, in and of itself, necessarily mean that it would be in a position of conflict if it were the applicant in winding up proceedings against the Company. It is necessary to identify what the conflicting interests are. Lim has not shown how the Trustee’s interest in protecting itself against potential claims by some noteholders would conflict with its interests as Trustee representing the noteholders in applying for and obtaining an order to wind up the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, once the winding up commences, I am of the view that the Trustee would be in a position of conflict. After the Company is ordered to be wound up, the liquidators will step in and take control of the Company and its property and things in action. One of the liquidators’ responsibilities would be to investigate the Company’s affairs and to seek recovery where warranted. The Trustee (as the applicant in the winding up proceedings) would need to continue to liaise with the liquidators and to provide the liquidators with all relevant information. In doing so, the Trustee has to consider the noteholders’ interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As the Trustee is facing potential claims by some noteholders, its interest in protecting itself against such claims would conflict with its duty to protect the interests of the noteholders. For example, the liquidators may investigate the Assignment and the use of the proceeds from the Assignment. As Lim points out, the Trustee discussed the Assignment and redemption of the Unsecured Notes (among other things) with Peter Kwee. Lim (and the noteholders supporting him) have taken issue with the Trustee’s responses to the Assignment and Peter Kwee’s statement that he was considering other options such as conversion with respect to the redemption of the Unsecured Notes (see [9] above). The Trustee may have information that is relevant to the liquidators but which may be adverse to its own interests in any action brought by the noteholders against it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I do not have to decide whether the Trustee did in fact breach its duties under the Trust Deed. It is sufficient for present purposes that the conflict of interest may potentially arise. The Trustee should not place itself in such a position. For this reason, I agree with Lim that cl 8.3 of the Trust Deed is not applicable in this case and therefore it does not preclude Lim from pursuing CWU 78.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Lim also submits that the Trustee has placed itself in a position of conflict by insisting that the Company is a holder of Unsecured Notes (see [23(a)] above). Lim argues that the interests of the Company would be diametrically opposed to the interests of the other noteholders. I disagree. The noteholders (excluding the Company) may not all agree that the Company should be wound up. The Trustee cannot be said to be in a position of conflict just because different noteholders have different views on the best course of action to take. The Trustee just has to act in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed. The fact that the Company is treated as a noteholder does not change the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CWU 78</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As cl 8.3 of the Trust Deed is not applicable, I find that Lim has the requisite standing to apply to wind up the Company in CWU 78. As there is no dispute that the Company is unable to pay its debts, I order that the Company be wound up. I also appoint Mr Cameron Lindsay Duncan and David Dong-Won Kim, care of KordaMentha Restructuring, 16 Collyer Quay, Singapore 049318, as joint and several liquidators of the Defendant. Finally, I order that costs of the proceedings be taxed, if not agreed or fixed, and be paid to Lim out of the assets of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">OA 96</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As stated earlier, in OA 96, the Company seeks a permanent anti-suit injunction to restrain Lim from instituting and/or continuing with proceedings against the Company in breach of the terms of the Trust Deed. This application is also based on cl 8.3 of the Trust Deed. As I have found that cl 8.3 is not applicable in this case, the Company’s case for the permanent anti-suit injunction fails. Accordingly, I dismiss OA 96.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lim’s application in CWU 78 is granted and the Company’s application in OA 96 is dismissed.
