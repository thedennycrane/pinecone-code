He then went down to check. He saw the plaintiff’s left leg under the rear wheels on the left side of the Lorry and the 2nd defendant lying flat on the ground. According to the Lorry Driver, at the time of the collision, the Lorry’s cabin was already in Tuas Avenue 20, and the back of the Lorry had passed the yellow box at the junction.

The left handle of the Motorcycle was dented and the plastic piece covering the front wheel was scratched, but the Motorcycle was otherwise undamaged.

</div> The 2nd defendant had in fact noticed the Lorry stationary at the stop line while he was nearing the junction. It was reasonable for the 2nd defendant to infer that the Lorry Driver had seen his approach and was stopping to give way to his Motorcycle. As such, 2nd defendant could not have reasonably anticipated that the Lorry would suddenly move off and enter into the junction as the 2nd defendant was entering into the same.

In all three cases, the motorist entering the junction from a minor road failed to stop and collided with a vehicle traveling along a major road. The motorist in all three cases were found fully liable for the accident. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Sim Moy v Ong Sim Hoe</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [5]), the court held that the lorry driver on the major road was not at fault, as he had done all he could to avoid a collision by applying his brakes and swerving to his right. In <span class="font-italic">Yap Yew Yee v Subramaniam</span>, the Malaysian court held that the taxi driver travelling on the major road was entitled to assume that the motorcyclist coming from the minor road would have stopped at the junction, and there was nothing the taxi driver could have done to avoid the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Intervener submitted that the 1st defendant’s reliance on the MAG is misconceived.

He made exaggerated allegations on several occasions during his cross-examination, which on questioning were found to be wholly unsubstantiated:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One example is his allegation that the Motorcycle was speeding. He later acknowledged that he would not have known this, since his evidence is that he did not even see the Motorcycle. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A second example is his evidence that the pillion rider was thrown off the Motorcycle because of the high speed it was travelling at.

In fact, his evidence is that he initially thought that the sound of the impact was that of a burst tyre. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A third example is the Lorry Driver’s claim that the 2nd defendant’s Motorcycle had skidded, which was denied by the 2nd defendant. The Lorry Driver admitted that he did not hear or see any skidding. Neither did he see any marks on the road that showed that the Motorcycle skidded. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A fourth example is his evidence in court that he was only traveling at a very slow speed of 7km/h into the junction. This was not in his police report or affidavit. He was unable to produce any objective record to substantiate this claim. It is also an incredibly slow speed which most vehicles normally do not travel at. Yet, his evidence was that this is the speed that he usually entered into cross junctions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) A fifth example is his evidence in court that the front of the Lorry cabin was already in Tuas Avenue 20, and that he had substantially passed the Cross Junction at the time of the Accident.

</div>
</div>
</div> He also testified that the photograph reflects exactly where the Lorry was positioned at the time of the impact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Importantly, the nub of the Lorry Driver’s evidence, that he kept a proper lookout before he entered the Cross Junction, lacks credibility: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He maintained that he kept a lookout for oncoming vehicles, and in fact checked again even as he moved into the junction, and that he saw no vehicles. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This was despite the fact that he had clear vision of any vehicles approaching. In fact, his evidence was that he could see up to the distance of the green sign in Exhibit B in 2AB, which is quite far away. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if a vehicle was speeding, it would have taken several seconds to traverse the distance down Tuas Crescent towards the Cross Junction. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Hence, it is highly implausible that if the Lorry Driver had kept a lookout, twice as he alleged, he would not see any vehicle. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) I therefore find that he did not see the Motorcycle because he did not keep a proper lookout before he moved into the Cross Junction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 There is also no evidence to support the Lorry Driver’s allegation that the Motorcycle was speeding. Given that the 2nd defendant did not sustain significant injuries, and given the lack of major damage to his Motorcycle from impact with the Lorry (the left handle was dented from falling onto the road and the plastic piece covering the front wheel was scratched), it is highly unlikely that the Motorcycle was traveling at a high speed when it neared the Cross Junction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2nd defendant’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In contrast, I found the 2nd defendant to be a forthright and honest witness:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) His evidence that he was not speeding was supported by the objective evidence which showed that neither he nor his Motorcycle sustained any major injury or damage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) When he was asked about the Lorry Driver’s evidence that he was driving into the junction at 7km/h, he was candid in admitting that he could not tell what speed the Lorry was moving at, but only added that as the Lorry was much larger, it covered the space before him quickly. He said that to him it was moving at a normal speed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) He was measured and did not take the position of blaming the Lorry Driver wherever possible. When asked whether he agreed with the Lorry Driver’s evidence that he stopped immediately upon impact, he testified that it was important for him to say that the Lorry Driver was right in saying that he braked. He said that if the Lorry Driver had not, the Lorry would have gone over more of the plaintiff’s body.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On the facts, I find that there was nothing more that the 2nd defendant could have done to avoid the Accident: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The law only requires a road user to anticipate an act which is reasonably foreseeable as being within the ordinary range of human experience. This duty is not an overly onerous one such that the road user has to guard against every conceivable eventuality (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit Ltd v Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane </span><span class="font-italic">(administratrix of the estate of Anthony John Stafford, deceased) </span>[2007] SLR(R) 211 at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Further, there is no legal duty on a driver to slow down automatically each time when the driver approaches a junction where there is no stop sign (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan</span><span class="font-italic"> (Yong Tian Choy, third party)</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [95]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The 2nd defendant could not have reasonably foreseen that the Lorry Driver would suddenly enter into the junction and collide with his Motorcycle. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In fact, he had done what he reasonably could by pressing on the brakes of the Motorcycle and avoided further damage to the vehicles and himself. Unfortunately, the plaintiff was injured. But that was not due to the 2nd defendant’s negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In line with this, the MAG’s starting point of 20% liability for the motorist traveling on the major road, which the 1st defendant relied on (at [11] above), would not apply here. The MAG is a helpful guide, but its suggestions on apportionment of liability require the court to further take into account the facts of each case. The MAG’s suggestion of 20% liability as a starting point, presupposes that the motorist along the main road is in a position to take evasive action to avoid the collision. Here, I have found that there was nothing that the 2nd defendant could have done to avoid the collision. The apportionment of liability is premised upon the finding of liability. As I have found that the 2nd defendant is not liable, the issue of apportionment does not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The 1st defendant also relied on <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Eng</span>. But that case turns on different considerations. In that case, a lorry was making a right turn at a junction into the main road. A motorcycle was traveling on the main road, coming from the right side of the junction, towards the junction. The court held that the motorcyclist was 20% liable for the accident when the motorcycle collided with the lorry. On the facts there, the court found that a reasonable motorcyclist would have seen the lorry and yet there was no tyre mark, indicating that the motorcyclist either did not see the impending collision in time, or had misjudged the lorry’s speed (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 But here, the 2nd defendant could not have reasonably foreseen that the Lorry would move off from its stationary position behind the stop line. The 2nd defendant also pulled on the brake as soon as he saw the Lorry enter the Cross Junction. At this point, the Motorcycle was already very close to the junction. The 2nd defendant could not have safely taken any other evasive action.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intervener’s late submission on the 1st defendant’s lack of notice of contribution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 After the trial and after parties had filed their closing submissions, the Intervener filed a supplementary submission dated 23 April 2021, relying on <span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik Engineering Pte Ltd v Munshi Mohammad Faiz</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2021] SGHC(A) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik</span>”) to submit that the 1st defendant should not be permitted to ask the court to apportion liability between the 1st and 2nd defendants since the 1st defendant had not served the 2nd defendant with any formal notice of contribution under O 16 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Order 16 r 8 refers to a notice “containing a statement of the nature and grounds of his claim or, as the case may be, of the question or issue required to be determined”. In <span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [33]), the Appellate Division of the High Court had advised that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We hope that, in future, solicitors will not assume that there is such a power [for the court to order contribution] and will make the appropriate submissions before the court of first instance but, as mentioned, it would be preferable if the situation were simply avoided by the filing of a formal claim for contribution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The 1st defendant subsequently filed their reply through supplementary closing submissions. The 1st  defendant submitted that in the present case, the notice to seek contribution from the 2nd defendant was already given in the form of the 1st defendant’s pleadings, where the 1st defendant had expressly served on the 2nd defendant “a statement of the nature and ground of his claim”.

</div> In addition, the 1st defendant had at the close of the 1st defendant’s case, informed the Court through their solicitors that the 1st defendant would, for the avoidance of doubt, be seeking contribution from the 2nd defendant. Thus, there is no doubt that the 1st defendant had given notice of his claim for contribution against the 2nd defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In light of my finding that the 1st defendant is 100% liable, this issue is not germane. I have thus not asked for further submissions from parties on whether the lack of an O 16 r 8 notice constrains the power of the court in apportioning liability in the circumstances of this case. I note that in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2020,</span> <span class="font-italic">vol 1</span> (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th ed, 2019) at [16/8/1], it is stated, in relation to O 16 r 8, that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Except where the two defendants are sued as tortfeasors liable in respect of the same damage</span>, it is necessary for a defendant who claims against his co-defendant relief of any of the kinds mentioned in the rule to issue and serve upon him a third party notice under this rule and a summons for third party directions under r.4. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Here, the two defendants are sued as tortfeasors liable in respect of the same damage.

The third defendant (who was seeking leave to appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hwa Aik</span>) made no argument for contribution from the other defendants at the trial.
