The First Defendant recommended appointing Globchem as the logistics and warehousing agent in Singapore. The first shipment to Globchem was completed on 31 March 2013. Upon receipt of such goods belonging to the First Plaintiff, Globchem duly delivered the goods to the First Plaintiff’s various customers. In turn, Globchem invoiced the First Plaintiff for its services and was paid accordingly.

Globchem was thus requested to return the goods that it held to the First Plaintiff’s factory or to ship it to the First Plaintiff’s warehouse in Rotterdam. To that end, the First Defendant was tasked to send an email to Globchem on 21 July 2014, giving advance notice of the shipment of all goods from Singapore to Rotterdam.

</div> In this correspondence, Jacqueline had attached the stock report for November 2014 and December 2014. This appears to have detailed the inventory that was held by Globchem for the First Plaintiff, as Mr Chan had pointed out errors in the inventory report, requesting modifications by Jacqueline. Thereafter, Jacqueline had replied with the attachment titled “INVENTORY LIST ( O’LAUGHLIN -Globchem Pte Ltd)- Dec 2014”. The plaintiffs’ evidence was that the estimated value of these goods was approximately US$623,781.21.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Following the failure to ship the goods to Rotterdam, the First Defendant (who was then based in Shanghai) was tasked to travel to Singapore to enquire about Globchem’s whereabouts. The First Defendant then reported that Globchem had moved out of the registered office that it previously occupied. In September 2016, the plaintiffs then appointed Singapore solicitors to commence investigations into the defendants. It was discovered that on 12 November 2015, Globchem’s registered address had been changed to Jacqueline’s residential address.

It should also be noted that in the application, it had been stated that Globchem had not commenced business operations since the date of incorporation, and that it had no contingent assets and liabilities.

MFO personally responded proposing a meeting to negotiate a resolution despite doubting the validity of the quality issues. Desiree, however, avoided all attempts to meet up in person.

In essence, the First Defendant was, at all times, communicating with himself, on behalf of the Second Plaintiff on the one hand and Pegasus on the other.

This was at least a year before the email from Ms Mo. Further, as MFO testified in court, the profits for 2013 were substantial, amounting to over US$2m in profit.

Additionally, on the plain wording of the Ms Mo’s email, it appeared that she was simply encouraging the First Defendant to follow up on outstanding invoices to ensure cash flow within the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The First Defendant further alleged that MFO would have been aware of these activities because the latter “micromanaged” the plaintiffs, exercising “strict control over small matters”.

Even if MFO was closely involved in the operations of the plaintiffs’, any switching of the products would have occurred <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the purview of the plaintiffs’ and been carried out by Globchem. While the First Defendant alleged that the quantities of Kovyral were reflected in weekly inventory reports circulated to MFO, he has failed to adduce in evidence any such reports, much less to show that the reports reflected quantities of <span class="font-italic">switched </span>Kovyral.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, the Globchem-Karl Rapp shipments and the AGX Logistics-Karl Rapp shipments were schemes carried out by the First Defendant on his own.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I am unable to accept the plaintiffs’ argument that Jacqueline should be liable as there is no documentary evidence that the proceeds from Globchem’s bank accounts did go to Jacqueline; and that there is no documentary evidence that the First Defendant had handled Globchem’s business on his own, especially given that he was in Shanghai at the time. Given that the plaintiffs are alleging that Jacqueline had somehow assisted the First Defendant in his plans, the burden is on them to show that that is the case and to adduce the necessary documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is acknowledged that the First Defendant might be said to be motivated to lie in his evidence in order to shield Jacqueline from liability. I find that unlikely to be the case here. The forging of signatures and masquerading as others behind email communications was an act entirely consistent with what the First Defendant did in relation to the Pegasus shipments (as above at [16]). In the circumstances, it is more likely that Jacqueline has become implicated as she had trusted the First Defendant, allowing him to incorporate Globchem in her name and signing the cheques for his use. That, however, is insufficient to show any wrongdoings on her part. I accept that it is very difficult for the plaintiffs in such a situation to adduce evidence to prove their case against Jacqueline. However, that is the burden that they have to bear, and I do not find, on the evidence before me, that they have discharged that burden. Accordingly, I find that Jacqueline is not liable in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Desiree</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 There is no evidence that Desiree was involved in the schemes of the First Defendant. In this regard, I accept the First Defendant’s explanation that the initial plan was to have Jacqueline incorporate Pegasus to assist the First Defendant in the chemical trade. However, as Jacqueline was, at the time, holding a position under a separate company, she was not agreeable to this proposition. Desiree was thus brought in as a nominee director, with Jacqueline as the authorised signatory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Beyond this, however, Desiree was not involved in any other way. The plaintiffs again pointed to the emails that were purportedly sent by Desiree, as above at [15]. As with the emails sent by “Jonathan Foo” (as above at [16]), and in relation to “Jacqueline Tan” (as above at [51]), these were in fact drafted and sent out by the First Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It bears mentioning that at the relevant times, Desiree was still a full-time student and had no knowledge of the company operations. This much was evident on cross-examination and counsel for the plaintiffs, in my view, made no headway in proving otherwise. Accordingly, Desiree is not liable in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pegasus</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The First Defendant utilised Pegasus for his schemes under the pseudonym of Jonathan Foo. This induced the plaintiffs to transport the goods in the Pegasus shipment, which Pegasus then sold on for a total sum of US$657,150, as above at [17]. With the First Defendant having admitted liability in relation to the Pegasus shipments, it is indisputable that Pegasus should be jointly liable for the losses there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I note that Pegasus has also received US$71,250 from the sale of the 228 drums of genuine Tonalid on 26 September 2016, as above at [30]. Given my findings in relation to the Globchem-Karl Rapp shipments and the AGX Logistics-Karl Rapp shipments, as above at [42]–[45], Pegasus is jointly liable for the sum of US$71,250 that it had received.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Huat Chye</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I find that on a balance of probabilities, Huat Chye was also not involved in the schemes of the defendant. On occasion, the First Defendant had engaged Huat Chye to handle certain accounting matters for the First Defendant’s companies, namely Globchem, Luxepack and Pegasus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiffs’ case, however, was that he was handling the accounts of these companies. As an experienced businessman personally handling the accounts, he would have been aware of the suspicious transactions that were taking place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my view, the plaintiffs’ allegations are speculative at best. There simply is no evidence to support the plaintiffs’ claim that Huat Chye, as the First Defendant’s “trusted lieutenant” was “deliberately feigning ignorance” or “downplaying his involvement”.

</div> Indeed, they have not been able to point to any evidence to support the allegation that Huat Chye had assisted in the re-packing of the products to deceive the plaintiffs. I accept that Huat Chye was engaged on an <span class="font-italic">ad-hoc</span> basis, when the First Defendant needed errands to be run. In return, he was paid for these services as a form of “pocket money”, on most occasions with a sum of $500, and on two occasions, $1,000.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This, however, in no way translates to any assistance or knowledge in relation to the wrongdoings carried out by the First Defendant. Accordingly, I find that Huat Chye is not liable in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Thiam Teng</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiffs allege that Luxepack was used as a conduit to wrongly deal with the goods held by Globchem on behalf of the plaintiffs. Following a third-party disclosure application against Standard Chartered Bank, the plaintiffs obtained disclosure of documents pertaining to the Luxepack SCB Account. These documents revealed the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The First Defendant and Thiam Teng had signed a board resolution opening the Luxepack SCB Account in November 2012, with the First Defendant and Jacqueline as the approved bank signatories.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Between January 2014 and February 2015, substantial sums were remitted to Luxepack from the plaintiffs’ customers, including:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) S$657,785.03 from a company called Fragrance World;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) S$62,453.45from Nardev Chemie; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) S$89,180.48 from a company called Bio Young Aromas.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On that basis, the plaintiffs claim that Thiam Teng was involved in the wrongdoings perpetrated by the First Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In my view, the claims against Thiam Teng are again speculative at best. It is evident from his testimony in court that Thiam Teng simply had no knowledge in relation to any of Luxepack’s activities. The First Defendant and Jacqueline had both testified at multiple points that Thiam Teng was unaware of Luxepack’s activities or that the Luxepack SCB account even existed.

</div>
</div> In fact, the First Defendant testified that he had forged Thiam Teng’s signature on multiple occasions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 That Thiam Teng was not involved in any way is most apparent from the fact that after his lawyers showed him documents relating to the striking off of Luxepack, he filed a police report alleging forgery. The plaintiffs have not adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Thiam Teng was implicated, and accordingly he is not liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At this juncture, however, I pause to point out Thiam Teng’s non-cooperation in these proceedings. In Registrar’s Appeal No 132 of 2019, I ordered that Thiam Teng was to provide discovery of all documents in his possession, custody or power relating to Luxepack. Following this, Thiam Teng disclosed four letters that were exchanged between his lawyers and Standard Chartered Bank. The last of these letters was dated 16 August 2019. Subsequently, Thiam Teng represented in various affidavits that these four letters were all that existed, for instance:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his reply affidavit in summons no 5014 of 2019 (SUM 5014/2019), filed on 22 October 2019, Thiam Teng stated that he had “made every effort at procuring documents” relating to the Luxepack SCB Account. He then went on to specifically refer only to the four letters.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In his supplementary affidavit in SUM 5014/2019, filed on 19 December 2019, Thiam Teng stated that “to comply with [Assistant Registrar] Wong’s directions, I put it on record that I have not received any correspondence from [Standard Chartered Bank] after 16 August 2019”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 This could not be further from the truth. In fact, there existed a letter dated 19 August 2019, sent from Standard Chartered Bank to Thiam Teng’s lawyers.
