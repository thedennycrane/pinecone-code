<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application for leave, pursuant to
                    O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), to seek a
                    quashing order. The applicants seek to quash (a) certain disciplinary
                    proceedings and (b) a report issued by the Disciplinary Tribunal dated
                    2 February 2010 containing their findings and determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The only issue raised before me is a
                    jurisdictional issue – whether the court has power to grant leave to apply
                    for a quashing order in light of s 91A of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”) which restricts judicial
                    review of “any act done or decision made by the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal” (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is the Law Society’s submission that
                    s 91A of the LPA, which was introduced via the 2008 round of statutory
                    amendments, has restricted the right of a solicitor to apply to the court for a
                    quashing order with the consequence that the only legal recourse against the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal’s acts or decisions is to a court of 3 Judges
                    of the Supreme Court provided for under s 98 of the LPA or a single Judge
                    under s 97 of the LPA, as the case may be. It further submits that the words
                    “any act done or decision made by the Disciplinary Tribunal” in
                    s 91A encompasses the Disciplinary Tribunal’s “findings and
                    determination” under s 93 of the LPA (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The applicants’ submission is that the
                    meaning and scope of the phrase “any act done or decision made by the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal” in s 91A of the LPA is confined only to acts
                    and decisions of the Disciplinary Tribunal in the course of its proceedings,
                        <em>ie</em> the rulings and conduct of the proceedings
                    and the evidence adduced during the Disciplinary Tribunal’s
                    investigations. The applicants argue that s 91A does not apply to
                    situations <em>after</em> the Disciplinary Tribunal has
                    issued its findings and determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The crux of the matter turns on the meaning to
                    be ascribed to the words “any act done or decision made” in
                    s 91A of the LPA. Does it have the same meaning as “findings and
                    determination” in s 93 of the same statute? Even if the two phrases
                    are not interchangeable, does the phrase “any act done or decision
                    made” nevertheless encompass “findings and
                    determination”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Changes introduced by the 2008 amendments to the LPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Prior to the 2008 amendments, under s 93 of
                    the LPA (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed), the Disciplinary Committee served two
                    functions. First, it investigated complaints and matters referred to it and made
                        <em>findings</em> in relation to the facts of the case.
                    Second, it <em>determined</em> whether any cause of
                    sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 existed and, even
                    where no such cause of sufficient gravity existed, whether the advocate and
                    solicitor ought to be reprimanded or ordered to pay a penalty appropriate to the
                    misconduct committed. Within the context of the pre-2008 wording of s 93,
                    the Disciplinary Committee’s findings were clearly quite separate from
                    their determinations. The Disciplinary Tribunal (which is the modern successor
                    to the Disciplinary Committee) functions the same way. Unfortunately, references
                    in judicial decisions as well as in Parliament have often conveniently, but
                    unhelpfully for the purposes of this application, loosely described the outcomes
                    of the Disciplinary Tribunal process as “decisions” of the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal instead of conforming to the statutory formulation,
                        <em>ie</em> “findings” and
                    “determination”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Bearing the above in mind, it was nonetheless a
                    well-established principle, prior to the 2008 amendments to the LPA, that the
                    findings and determination of the Disciplinary Committee could be subject to
                    judicial review notwithstanding that the applicant might have to show cause
                    before a court of 3 Judges (see <em>Re Singh
                        Kalpanath</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 595 at [26] – [27];
                        <em>Wong Keng Leong Rayney v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 934 at [1] and [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 377 at [15]; <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant
                        Kulkarni</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 (“<em>Re Shankar</em>”)). Prior to the 2008 amendments to the LPA,
                    the process of judicial review was a distinctly separate and independent process
                    from that of showing cause. The difference between judicial review and show
                    cause proceedings was canvassed in <em>Re Singh
                        Kalpanath</em> at [27], where Chan Sek Keong J observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The "show cause" proceedings are very different from judicial review
                        proceedings, both with respect to the law as well as the procedure. In the
                        former, the court goes into the merits of the findings and determination of
                        the DC on the basis of the evidence recorded by the DC. It does not hear
                        oral evidence at all. In the latter, the court does not deal with the merits
                        of the decision but with its legality on ordinary administrative law
                        grounds. Bias, as an aspect of procedural impropriety, is one of these
                        grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>Re Shankar</em> at [34],
                    Sundaresh Menon JC stressed that he “[did] not think it [was]
                    correct to view the court of three judges as an alternative remedy to the
                    seeking of judicial review”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The 2008 amendments to the LPA, however,
                    introduced a number of significant changes, including s 91A. Also, as
                    already mentioned above, the Disciplinary Committee was renamed the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal. The introduction of s 91A was concurrently accompanied by
                    amendments to ss 97 and 98 of the LPA. For convenience, the changes to
                    ss 91A, 93, 97 and 98 of the LPA are tabulated below:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purpose of s 91A of the LPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Explanatory Statement in the Legal
                    Profession (Amendment) Bill No 16 of 2008 is the starting point for
                    determining the purpose of s 91A:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 36 introduces a new section 91A, which provides that
                        there will be no judicial review in any court of any act done or decision
                        made by a Disciplinary Tribunal except in accordance with sections 82A,
                        97 and 98. The court hearing an application under section 82A (10), 97
                        or 98 will have the power to consider any matter which might otherwise have
                        been raised at an application for judicial review of a decision of a
                        Disciplinary Tribunal, including any question as to the legality or
                        propriety of the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal, or as to the
                        regularity of any proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 91A is clearly intended to place restrictions on
                    applications for judicial review. However, how has s 91A affected access to
                    judicial review?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As amended, s 97 of the LPA has enlarged
                    the powers of the single Judge by expressly providing for “review”
                    where the Disciplinary Tribunal has made a determination that there is no need
                    for a show cause proceeding before the court of 3 Judges. The powers of the
                    court of 3 Judges were also expanded under the amended s 98 of the LPA
                    so as to include, in addition to the powers it previously had to hear show cause
                    proceedings, the power to determine “any question as to the correctness,
                    legality or propriety of the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal, or as
                    to the regularity of any proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal”. The
                    words “correctness, legality or propriety” and
                    “regularity” are directly referable to the three grounds of
                    judicial review – illegality, irrationality and (procedural) impropriety
                    (see <em>Council of Civil Services Unions v Minister for the
                        Civil Service</em> [1985] AC 374 at 410 per Lord Diplock).
                    An examination of the amended s 98 of the LPA reveals that the court of
                    3 Judges now has, in addition to its power to adjudicate on the merits of
                    the case, the power of judicial review over the Disciplinary Tribunal. In other
                    words, the court of 3 Judges now presides over the show cause proceedings
                    and also proceedings relating to judicial review. Where the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal has not determined that show cause proceedings are necessary, the
                    single Judge will now also have the power of judicial review <em>after</em> the findings and determination of the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal are made, pursuant to s 97 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Seen in the light of the operation of
                    ss 97 and 98, it would appear that the purpose of s 91A is to restrict
                    judicial review by consolidating the judicial review process with the hearings
                    on merit into one process, instead of maintaining them as distinctly separate
                    processes. What this means is that judicial review remains available but only
                    through the single Judge process under s 97 (in the event there are no show
                    cause proceedings) or the court of 3 Judges under s 98 (in the event there
                    are show cause proceedings). Given the provisions in ss 97 and 98 and how
                    they relate to s 91A, in my view, Parliament could not have intended to
                    preserve both an entirely redundant round of judicial review of the findings and
                    determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal (as per what the applicants are
                    submitting), <em>and</em>, additionally, judicial review a
                    second time under the now enlarged single Judge process under s 97 or the
                    court of 3 Judges process under s 98, as the case may be. I have not
                    found anything in the parliamentary speeches to convince me
                otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interpretation of s 97 of the LPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It bears repeating that post-2008, pursuant to
                    s 91A, judicial review of “any act done or decision made by the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal” is no longer available except as provided for in
                    ss 82A, 97 and 98 of the LPA. However, ss 82A, 97 and 98 never once
                    refer to the “act” of the Disciplinary Tribunal. Instead, the
                    words “determination” and “finding” appear in those
                    provisions. The legislative draftman’s insertion of the statutory
                    formulation of “any act done or decision made” in s 91A
                    infelicitously led to the uncertainty raised in this application, as the
                    functions and processes of the Disciplinary Tribunal to which it refers are
                    described in ss 93, 97 and 98 not as “act done” or
                    “decision” but as, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    “findings” and “determination[s]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Nonetheless, the sole reference (within
                    ss 82A, 97 and 98) to a “decision” of the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal at s 97 is, in my view, revealing and buttresses my findings at
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above. The heading of s 97 is
                    “Application for review of Disciplinary Tribunal’s <em>decision</em>” (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Yet, the wording of the provision proper does not
                    once mention the word “decision”. Instead it deals with
                    applications to the Judge for review where “a Disciplinary Tribunal has
                    made a <em>determination</em> under
                        section 93(1)(<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>)”. This supports the interpretation that the phrase
                    “any act done or decision made by the Disciplinary Tribunal” in
                    s 91A ought to be construed widely to encompass the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal’s “findings and determination” under s 93 of
                    the LPA such that judicial review of all acts and decisions of the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal are restricted to the extent that they can now only be invoked by way
                    of applications under ss 97 and 98 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ministerial answers to questions raised in Parliament</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The applicants submit that the ministerial
                    answers to questions raised in Parliament support their proposed narrower
                    construction of s 91A. During the second reading of the Legal Profession
                    (Amendment) Bill in Parliament (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (26 August 2008) vol 84 at
                    col 3187 – 3259), the Member of Parliament (“MP”) for
                    Tampines asked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, there is just one other point that I wish to comment on the Bill.
                        Clause 36 introduces a new section 91A which restricts judicial
                        review in any court on any act done or declaration made by the Disciplinary
                        Tribunal. Sir, I am just puzzled as to why the Government should choose this
                        draconian approach in taking away the right of an affected person who is the
                        subject of an administrative law action from seeking redress at our Courts.
                        In the context of our Constitution, the right of an aggrieved person to seek
                        redress at our Courts is fundamental. Restricting this right would run
                        counter to the spirit of our Constitution even if the restriction itself is
                        not on the face of it, <em>ultra vires</em> the
                        Constitution. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister could explain
                        why this restriction to judicial review in the new section was introduced in
                        the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Minister for Law had earlier during the Second Reading outlined
                    the purpose of the amendments:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are a range of amendments to streamline the entire disciplinary
                        process. I will only outline the key changes here.  Specific timelines
                        are stipulated for each step of the disciplinary process. To deter frivolous
                        complaints, it will be mandated that every complaint against a lawyer be
                        made in writing and be supported by a statutory declaration, except when the
                        complaint is made by a public officer. A limitation period of
                        six years, in line with the general limitation in law, will be
                        introduced to prevent stale complaints. The powers of the Inquiry Committee
                        and Disciplinary Tribunal to order costs will be enhanced. Sentencing
                        options will also be enhanced. Judicial review of the Disciplinary
                        Tribunal's decision can only be applied for after the conclusion of the
                        Disciplinary Tribunal's deliberations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Minister for Law later replied to the MP for Tampines’s
                    question as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Sin Boon Ann asked why do we have clause 36 which restricts
                        judicial review. In fact, he said "ousted" judicial review. "It is an
                        important constitutional safeguard. Why are we doing this?" <em>I would clarify that judicial review is not "ousted". What we
                            are doing is deferring it, because what has happened in the past is that
                            even before the tribunal proceedings and disciplinary proceedings are
                            over, there were repeated applications for judicial review, which then
                            dragged on and delayed the entire proceedings, vastly contributing to
                            delays. So, the approach has been to finish with the process, then you
                            go for judiciary review. Anyway, when you go before the Court of Three
                            Judges, you can raise all the arguments that you could have raised
                            during the judicial review. So the lawyer is, to that extent, not in any
                            worse-off position but what he cannot do now is to try and interrupt or
                            delay the ongoing proceedings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The applicant cites the italicised portions of
                    the Minister for Law’s reply as supporting his submission that judicial
                    review post findings and determination have been preserved in addition to
                    ss 97 or 98 of the LPA. However, I would observe that the court’s
                    task is to construe the statutory language of s 91A purposively. As
                    mentioned above, a purposive construction of s 91A of the LPA in light of
                    its interaction with ss 97 and 98, and the Explanatory Statement leads to
                    the conclusion that judicial review of all the acts and decisions (including
                    findings and determinations) of the Disciplinary Tribunal have been restricted
                    to the extent that they can only be invoked by way of applications under
                    ss 97 or 98 of the LPA (see [11] and [13]). I need go no
                further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I would add that in any event, a close reading
                    of both the MP for Tampines’s question and the Minister for Law’s
                    answer in their full context does not support the applicants’ proposed
                    construction of s 91A of the LPA. The sequence of the question and the
                    answer in its context can be distilled and restated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Have you ousted judicial review?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, we are deferring it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The problem was previous delays, so the approach now is finish with the
                        process then go for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">You can raise judicial review arguments before the court of 3 Judges.
                        So lawyers are not in any worse-off position but what they cannot do is try
                        and interrupt or delay the ongoing process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nothing in the full context of the question put to the Minister for
                    Law and indeed the Minister’s answer in its context is at variance with my
                    earlier purposive construction of s 91A. In fact, it confirms my reading
                    that with the 2008 amendments, the LPA now defers judicial review until after
                    the findings and the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal are made. Where
                    no show cause proceedings are necessary, s 97 applies and judicial review
                    is heard by a single Judge. Where show cause proceedings are ordered, s 98
                    applies and judicial review is consolidated with the show cause proceedings and
                    heard by the court of 3 Judges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In light of my findings above, I dismiss the
                    applications and order costs to be agreed or taxed to be paid by the applicants
                    to the respondent.</p>
