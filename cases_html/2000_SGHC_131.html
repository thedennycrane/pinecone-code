<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Cur Adv Vult</strong></font></em>
<b><u></u></b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    This is an appeal by Hong

Huat Development Co. (Pte) Ltd against part of an award by an arbitrator.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><b><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></b></u></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>2.    The Appellants are the owners of a 6 storey shopping centre in

Upper Serangoon Road. In 1979, they had entered into a written agreement with the

Respondents Hiap Hong &amp; Company Pte Ltd dated 27 January 1979 (‘the

Contract’) for the Respondents to build the shopping centre. The Respondents were the

main contractors. The Contract incorporated, inter alia, the 1979 Singapore Institute of

Architects Standard Conditions. In the Contract, the Appellants are referred to as

‘the Employer’ as is frequently the case in building contract documents.

However, the Appellants do not, strictly speaking, employ the Respondents. They engage the

Respondents to build the shopping centre.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The firm of architects engaged by the

Appellants was Chen &amp; Associates Architects (‘the Architect’). Counsel for

each of the parties referred to the Appellants as ‘the Employers’ of the

Architect and generally referred to owners who engage a firm of architects as ‘the

employers’. The same description is used in textbooks. While this may be a convenient

description, it is, strictly speaking, not correct when the architects are in private

practice.</font></p>
<p xmlns="">4.    <font face="Times New Roman">Disputes arose between the parties

and such disputes were referred to an arbitrator.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    In the arbitration proceedings, the

Appellants (before me) were the Respondents and the Respondents (before me) were the

Claimants. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    After a very long delay, the

arbitrator eventually published his award on 24 December 1994. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    The Appellants were dissatisfied with

parts of the award and sought leave under s 28 of the Arbitration Act (Ch 10) to appeal to

the High Court. On 21 March 2000, such leave was eventually granted by the Court of Appeal

on a question of law.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    In paragraph 55 of its Judgment, the

Court of Appeal said that,</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The appeal will be on the question

  what is the nature or extent of the term to be implied as regards the duties of the

  appellants as employers in relation to the certifying functions of the architect under the

  SIA Conditions.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>9.    It is not disputed that in the question framed, the reference to

the architect means the Architect who is engaged (and not employed) by the Appellants. The

use of the description ‘employers’ arose probably because that was the label

used by Counsel for each party.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    Naturally, the question framed must

be considered in the context of the claims for which the award was made in favour of the

Respondents and which are the subject of the appeal before me. As it was, the award was in

respect of six main claims but Mr Teh said that the appeal before me concerned five of

them only. Furthermore, as regards one of the five claims, only part of it was the subject

of the appeal before me.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    The five relevant claims as set out

in the Re-Amended Points of Claim, were:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘5. In breach of clause 30(1) of the

  Schedule of Conditions, the Architects were repeatedly late in issuing their Interim

  Certificates of Payment, and in breach of the same provision, the Respondents were

  repeatedly late in honouring the Certificates that were issued. As a result of such delays

  the Claimants suffered financial loss amounting to <strike>$163,819.51</strike> <u>$397,788.88</u>.

  Full particulars will be given to the Respondents when they are ready. It is an implied

  term of the Schedule of Conditions that the Respondents as Employers will ensure the

  proper discharge by the Architects of their duties as prescribed under the Schedule of

  Conditions. The Architects having failed to discharge their duties in compliance with

  clause 30(1) as aforesaid, the Respondents are in breach of this implied term. [I will

  refer to this claim as "Item (a)".]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. In breach of clause 30(2) of the

  Schedule of Conditions, the Architects issued several Interim Certificates of Payment

  which allowed greater amounts to be deducted as retention money than as provided under

  clause 30(3) of the Schedule of Conditions. This wrongful withholding of such greater

  amounts than permitted caused the Claimants to suffer a financial loss, amounting to

  $1,799.70. Full particular will be given to the Respondents when they are ready. It is an

  implied term of the Schedule of Conditions that the Respondents as Employers will ensure

  the proper discharge by the Architects of their duties as prescribed under the Schedule of

  Conditions. The Architects having failed to discharge their duties in compliance with

  clauses 30(2) and (3) as aforesaid, the Respondents are in breach of this implied term. [I

  Schedule of Conditions, the Architects failed to issue to the Claimants a Certificate for

  one moiety of the total amounts retained by the Respondents on the issuance of the

  Certificate of Practical Completion. In breach of clause 30(4)(c) of the Schedule of

  Conditions, the Architects also failed to issue to the Claimants a Certificate for the

  residue of the amounts retained by the Respondents as prescribed in the said clause. The

  failure to issue the two Certificates as prescribed in the said clause 30(4)(b) and (c)

  caused the Claimants to suffer a financial loss amounting to $26,351.40. Full particulars

  will be given to the Respondents when they are ready. It is an implied term of the

  Schedule of Conditions that the Respondents as Employers will ensure the proper discharge

  by the Architects of their duties as prescribed under the Schedule of Conditions. The

  Architects having failed to discharge their duties in compliance with clause 30(4)(b) and

  claim as "Item (c)".]</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">

  Schedule of Conditions, the Architects failed to issue the Final Certificate before the

  expiration of three (3) months from the end of the Defects Liability Period. This failure

  to issue the Final Certificate as aforesaid caused the Claimants to suffer a financial

  loss amounting <strike>to $27,679.73</strike> <u>$176,210.50</u>. Full particulars will be

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<u><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. The Architects issued an Interim

  Certificate of Payment dated 21<sup>st</sup> June 1982 bearing reference No. S74/Con/26

  certifying an amount of $392,467.69. The Respondents paid the same to the Claimants but

  subsequently demanded from the Claimants a refund of $12,982.94, which the Respondents

  alleged to be the amount of over certification in the Architects’ Certificate No.

  S74/Con/26. The Claimants refunded the said sum of $12,982.94 but without prejudice to

  their rights to claim the same in the subsequent certificates. No adjustments were made to

  reflect the said refund in subsequent certificates. In the premises, the Claimants are

  entitled to a sum of $12,982.94 in addition to the sums of $711,661.45 and</font></p></u> <u>$146,235.46

</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>12.    Although the Re-Amended Points of Claim refers to ‘the

Schedule of Conditions’, it should refer to ‘the Conditions of Building

Contract’.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    Item (a) was actually a claim in two

parts. The first part was for $351,576.28 being interest for the alleged delay by the

Architect in issuing Interim Certificates as the Respondents received the monies later

than it should have. The second part was for $46,212.60 being interest for the

Appellants’ delay in honouring Interim Certificates. The appeal before me concerned

the first part but not the second part.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Item (b) was apparently a claim for

interest too but not for delay by the Architect in issuing certificates but for the

over-certification of sums to be retained as retention money.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    Items (c) and (d) were also claims

for interest for the delay by the Architect in issuing other certificates which he

apparently issued late.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    It is more difficult to understand

what Item (e) was about. The Re-Amended Points of Claim alleged that after the Appellants

had paid a certain sum, the Appellants demanded the refund of $12,982.94 as

over-certification on a certificate. The Respondents refunded the $12,982.94 but without

prejudice to its right to claim it in subsequent certificates. No adjustments were made to

reflect the refund in subsequent certificates. The Respondents then claimed to be entitled

to this sum.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    I asked both Counsel (a) whether the

Architect was asked to amend the certificate in question for Item (e) i.e. Certificate No

754/Con/26 to reflect the refund and (b) whether this sum was in any event included in the

Final Account and in the Final Certificate. Unfortunately neither Mr Teh nor Mr Chung were

acting for their respective clients at the time when the arbitration hearing took place

and neither could assist me further on Item (e).</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    Clause 30(1) to (4) and (6) of the

Conditions of Building Contract states:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘30(1) At the period of Interim

  Certificates named in the appendix to these Conditions the Architect shall issue a

  certificate stating the amount due to the Contractor from the Employer and the Contractor,

  shall, on presenting any such certificate to the Employer, be entitled to payment

  therefore within the Period for Honouring Certificates named in the appendix to these

  Conditions.</font><br/>
<font face="Times New Roman">Interim valuations shall be made whenever the Architect

  considers them to be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the amount to be stated as

  due in an Interim Certificate.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) The amount stated as due in an Interim

  Certificate shall, subject to any agreement between the parties as to stage payments, be

  the Works for use thereon up to and including a date not more than seven days before the

  date of the said certificate less any amount which may be retained by the Employer (as

  provided in sub-clause (3) of this Condition) and less any instalments previously paid

  under Condition. Provided that such certificate shall only include the value of the said

  amount named in said appendix as Limit of Retention Fund or that amount as reduced in

  pursuance of clause 16(f) and/or clause 27(e) of these Conditions, as the case may be, no

  further amounts shall be retained by virtue of this sub-clause.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) The amount retained by virtue of

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The Employer’s interest in any

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>19.    The arbitrator’s reasons for holding the Appellants liable

were as follows.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    In respect of Item (a), he said, </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘… there is an implied term

  between the Employer and the architect (<i>sic</i>) that the architect will exercise his

  certification functions according to the terms of the contract; and he would do all things

  necessary to enable the contractor to carry out the works, and the Employer is thus liable

  for <u>any</u><i> </i>breach of this duty on the part of the architect. Where the contract

  provides that an architect has power to certify as to such matters as interim payments, <u>he

  must be neutral in that he must act fairly and impartially</u> as between the Employer and

  the contractor.’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>21.    In respect of Item (b), he said, </p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘By reason that the terms in Clause

  30(2) are clearly stipulated under the contract for which the architect is obliged to act,

  I therefore find on the fact and hold that the Claimants are entitled to their claim for

  damages amounting to $1,799.70 for the Respondents’ breach of Clauses 30(2) and 30(3)

  of the Conditions of Building Contract.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>22.    In respect of Item (c), he said, </p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘On the plain reading of the terms in

  Clause 30 of the Conditions of Building Contract, it is obvious that this clause lays down

  procedures on how to regulate payment under the contract. It also sets out the way in

  which the contract sum, as adjusted by the various provisions in the contract, is to be

  paid over to the contractor. I have no doubt at all in my mind that given the fact that a

  Condition is a major term of the contract, the breach of which would give rise to a right

  to treat the contract as repudiated.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the fact that Clause 30(4)(b)

  provides that one moiety, ie., half of the retention percentage is payable on the issue of

  the Practical Completion Certificate under Clause 15, a term would thus be implied into a

  building contract <u>binding the Employer to ensure</u> that the architect, as certifier,

  shall perform his duty as Certifier under the contract.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This payment is against the

  architect’s certificate and is on the same terms as for interim certificates under

  Clause 30(1). Similarly, Clause 30(4)(c) deals with the release of the second half of

  Retention Percentage. Once the Contractor’s liability to remedy defects under Clause

  15 has been discharged, the second half of Retention percentage shall be released to the

  contractor.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This ought to occur either upon the

  Defects Liability Period expires (either six months or twelve months from the date of

  Practical Completion, whichever is the case as specified in the Appendix) or when the

  architect issues his Certificate of Completion of Making Good Defects, whichever is the

  later.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The architect shall then issue a

  certificate releasing the residue, and the contractor is entitled to payment on the same

  conditions as for interim certificates under Clause 30(1). By the fact that Clauses

  30(4)(b), and 30(4)(c) are explicit in their terms under the contract for which the

  architect is bound to act, I therefore find on the fact and hold that the Claimants are

  entitled to their claim for damages amounting to $26,351.40 for the Respondents’

  breach of Clauses 30(4)(b), and 30(4)(c) of the Conditions of Building Contract.’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>23.    In respect of Item (d), he said,</p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘I find as a fact that it is

  mandatory that the architect is required to issue the Final Certificate, and failure to

  issue such Final Certificate within the time and in a manner specified <u>is a breach of

  contract for which the employer is liable</u>. In the event, I find and hold that I would

  allow the Claimants’ claim of having suffered a final loss amounting to

  $176,210.50.’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>24.    In respect of Item (e), he said, </p></font>

  Claimants and accept that the Respondents indeed made no effort to ensure the inclusion in

  the Final Project Accounts this sum of $12,982.94 which the Claimants already refunded to

  the Respondents, but which the Respondents alleged the architect over-certified the said

  sum to the extent of $12,982.94 in his Certificate No. S74/Con/26.</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">However, in giving equal consideration to

  Certificate No. S74/Con/26 is not consonant with the general principle of equity and good

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    Mr Chung suggested that whatever the

functions of an architect, he was always the agent of the owner. He referred to Keating on

Building Contracts, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition 1995 at p.121 for the proposition that the

architect is the employee’s agent for the purpose of administering the building

contract and ‘performs the traditional duties of agent for the employer of

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    The actual passage reads:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘<b>Professional independence</b>. An

<p>35.    The quotation in the passage was from a judgment of Lord Reid in <i>Sutcliffe

v Thackrah</i> [1974] AC 727 at p.737. However, the clause quoted by Mr Chung is in the

next sentence which is not a quotation from Lord Reid’s judgment but is a comment in

the textbook. Lord Reid did not say that the architect is the agent of the owner or

performs the duties of an agent when the architect is certifying.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    Indeed in footnote 48, there is also

the following comment:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘There are many old cases (excerpts

  from which are set out in earlier editions of this book) referring to the dual function or

  dual capacity as it was sometimes called of the architect. Their basis is not, it is

  submitted, essentially different from the exposition by the House of Lords in <i>Sutcliffe

  v. Thackrah</i> but they frequently use words which speak in terms of the architect as an

  adjudicator or quasi-arbitrator and these terms should no longer be used. It is suggested

  that it is still, however, correct and useful when referring to those functions where the

  architect must act fairly to say that he must act "independently".’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>37.    The concept of dual functions recognises that when the architect

is a certifier he is to act fairly and independently. In my view he cannot act fairly and

independently if in that capacity he is also acting as agent of the owner. </p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    Halsbury’s Laws of England,

Fourth Edition, Reissue, Volume 4(2) at paras 522 and 523 states:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  client, the employer, and <u>then</u> as certifier have to decide whether the work or

<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>39.    Mr Chung also submitted that as an architect is employed by the

owner, only the owner has control over the architect. If the architect fails or refuses to

carry out his functions under the building contract, only the owner can tell him to do so,

not the contractor. Mr Chung relied on the following passage in para 6228 of

Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts 11<sup>th</sup> Edition 1995:</p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The building owner is naturally

  entitled to have a high degree of control over the services of the A/E for which he is

  paying, consistent with his exact status as a salaried official or as a professional man

  in private practice, but where the contract with the builder requires the A/E to decide

  matters judicially, the owner of necessity ceases to be entitled to control his activities

  in relation to the matter he is called upon to decide, whether as certifier or arbitrator

  ….’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The reference to ‘A/E’ is to an

architect/engineer.</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>40.    In my view that passage from Hudson’s does not assist Mr

Chung. It acknowledges the dual functions of the architect and that in his capacity as

certifier, the owner ceases to be entitled to control him.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    In fact, the passage goes on to say:</font>
</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘… The building owner must then

  leave the A/E to decide impartially, so far as he can do so as the paid agent of one side

  with possibly previously expressed opinions on the matter in question. While proper and no

  doubt strong representations can be made to him, they must not seek to limit his authority

  to decide, or <u>pass the borderline beyond which they interfere</u> with the free

  exercise of his function.’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.    <font face="Times New Roman">I would say that

there is no valid basis in principle, aside from case-law, to say that an owner must

ensure the proper discharge by the architect/certifier of his duties such as to render an

owner liable if the certifier fails to discharge his duty properly since the certifier is

supposed to act independently.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    Indeed Mr Chung must

have recognised this because he then tried to draw a distinction between 2 aspects of the

certification duties of an architect. Such a distinction would be unnecessary if the owner

was entitled to control the architect throughout the building contract and was liable for

the architect’s defaults irrespective of the architect’s functions. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    Mr Chung submitted

that as regards the duty to certify, an architect has 2 functions to perform: (a) the act

of issuing the certificates (‘function (a)’) and (b) the certification of the

actual amounts due to the contractor (‘function (b)’). To support this

distinction he cited paragraph 522 from Halsbury’s Laws of England which I have

already cited in paragraph 38 above.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    According to Mr

Chung’s submission, an architect acts as agent of the owner in function (a). He

described it as a mandatory function which the architect must do regardless of whether

claims had been submitted by the contractor (unless the contractor was required to submit

a claim as in the case for the Final Certificate).</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    Therefore, in so far

as function (a) is concerned, he submitted that an owner must ensure that the architect

carries out his duty regardless of whether the owner knows that the architect has failed

in his duty.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    In so far as

function (b) is concerned, he submitted that an owner must ensure that the architect

carries out his duty if the owner knows that the architect has not carried out his duty.

He relied on <i>Frederick Leyland &amp; Co Ltd (J Russel &amp; Co) v Compania Panamena

Europea Navegacion, Limitada </i>(1943) Vol 76 No 4 Lloyds Law Reports 113 (‘<i>Panamena</i>’)

and on <i>Perini Corporation v Commonwealth of </i>Australia 12 BLR 90 (‘<i>Perini</i>’)

for the requirement of knowledge and said these cases applied to function (b) but not to

function (a).</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    He argued that in <i>Panamena</i>,

the surveyor was required to certify the quality of work and this was function (b), hence

the requirement of knowledge by the owner for the certifier’s default. As for <i>Perini</i>,

he argued that the Director of Works was required to extend time for completion if he

thought that there was sufficient cause to do so and this also came within function (b).</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    However, I note that

in <i>Panamena</i>, it was not so much the wrong assessment of quality by the surveyor in

his certificate that was in dispute but the absence of the surveyor’s certificate.

That would have been function (a).</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    Besides, neither in <i>Panamena</i>

nor in <i>Perini</i> was a distinction drawn between function (a) and (b). Indeed, Mr

Chung had to admit that there were no cases drawing such a distinction.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    In my view such a

distinction is untenable. Where the architect acts as a certifier, he must act

independently. No distinction can or should be drawn between the question whether he has

wrongly delayed issuing a certificate and the question whether he has certified the wrong

amount. Both pertain to his certifying function.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    Mr Chung had another

difficulty. Even if he was right in drawing a distinction between function (a) and (b), it

is pertinent to note that for Item (b) (which is for loss of use of the sum that was

over-certified to be part of the retention sum) this came under function (b) and not

function (a). By his own submission, the Respondents could not have succeeded in its claim

for Item (b) unless the Appellants knew that the Architect had over-certified the amount

to be retained. The Appellants’ knowledge was not pleaded by the Respondents and Mr

Chung believed that there was no evidence before the arbitrator regarding the

Appellants’ knowledge of the alleged breaches by the Architect.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.    Mr Chung sought to

get around this difficulty by arguing that it was for the Appellants to plead that

knowledge of the Architect’s default (for function (b)) was required of them in order

to render them liable for the default. He also argued that it was for the Appellants to

prove that they did not know of the default.</font> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.    I am of the view

that this argument is also untenable. It is for the claimants i.e. the Respondents, to

plead the implied term correctly and to prove their case. If the Appellants are liable for

the Architect’s wrongful acts or omissions regarding its certifying function provided

the Appellants knew of the wrong, the Respondents must plead such knowledge and prove it.</font>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.    Mr Teh’s alternative

submission, which appeared to be his main argument, was that if there is an implied

obligation to marshall the architect, this was predicated on an owner first knowing that

the architect is not discharging his functions properly. For this proposition, he relied

on Panamena and Perini. He also relied on Emden’s Construction Law Issue 56/June 1999

at p.II 274 to 275 and Hudson’s Building &amp; Engineering Contracts, 1995, para

4.200.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.    Mr Teh also relied on paragraphs 43

and 44 of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 for his alternative submission.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.    Accordingly, Mr Teh was relying on

different parts of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 to support both his submissions

although they were in the alternative.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.    For his part, Mr Chung relied on

Panamena and Perini for the proposition that there is an implied obligation on the part of

the owner to ensure that a certifier is carrying out his duty properly.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.    Yet on the other hand, Mr Chung

sought to draw a distinction between Panamena and Perini on the one hand and the appeal

before me. As I have mentioned above, he submitted that in so far as Panamena and Perini

mentioned the requirement of knowledge on the part of the owner to render the owner

liable, this was relevant for function (b) but not for function (a).</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.    He also argued that paragraph 43 of

the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 was applicable to function (b) only.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.    As for Lubenham, Mr Chung said it

was authority for the proposition that if there was a wrongful deduction in a certificate

from an architect, then the certification could be challenged in arbitration.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.    Mr Chung also cited various

textbooks. I have mentioned a number of them above.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.    It is therefore necessary for me to

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73.    Goddard LJ seemed to have taken a

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The appointment of the surveyor in

  certificate. Equally, it seems to me, they must appoint someone who is willing to perform

  the duty assigned to him by the contract. If he will not or cannot perform that duty they

  must appoint someone who will. Here it is clear that Dr. Telfer refused to perform the

  simple duty of certifying whether the work was properly done, from the point of view of

  quality, because he took the view, and I will assume honestly, that the contract enabled

  and indeed required him to do something else and to concern himself with cost, with which

  he was in no way concerned and which was the business of the Costs Investigation Branch.

  He, therefore, was unwilling to carry out the duty assigned by the contract to him. The

  defendants either were of the same opinion or adopted his view; for this purpose, it

  matters not which. Consequently they neither required him to certify in accordance with

  the contract nor did they appoint anyone else in his place. It is no answer for them to

  say that that was because they misinterpreted the contract. It is often the case that a

</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>75.    There are factors which differentiate Panamena from the appeal

before me. </p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.    First, it is important to bear in

mind that in <i>Panamena</i>, the plaintiffs were not claiming for interest for loss of

use of a sum or sums of money. They were claiming to be entitled to be paid the principal

sum or sums notwithstanding the absence of a certificate by the surveyor. In the

particular circumstances of that case, they were successful.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77.    Secondly, in <i>Panamena</i>, the

surveyor, one Dr Telfar, was the president of the defendant company. There was also a

close relationship between him and the defendant company. It was he who had advised Messrs

J.D. Chandris and D.J. Chandris to buy the vessel and it was bought in Dr Telfar’s

name on their behalf when the defendant company was incorporated. Dr Telfar became

president and director and his wife became the other director of the defendant company.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78.    Thirdly, the court there agreed that

the defendants had been influencing Dr Telfar with their views and Dr Telfar was not

acting impartially.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79.    In the appeal before me, none of the

professionals in the firm of the Architect is employed or is an officer of the Appellants,

although the Architect was appointed by the Appellants.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80.    Secondly, there is no suggestion in

the appeal before me that the Appellants were influencing the Architect. Indeed the claim

of the Respondents was to the contrary i.e. that the Appellants were obliged to ensure

that the Architect discharged its duties properly. The Appellants were supposed to ensure

this by telling the Architect to issue the certificates in question.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81.    In so far as the judgments in <i>Panamena</i>

say that it was the duty of the defendants to tell the repairer what his function was and

to call him to book, if the defendants had known that he was departing from his proper

function under the contract, I would respectfully suggest that this proposition be

confined to the particular facts of the <i>Panamena</i>.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82.    In so far as Scott LJ implied such a

duty from authorities like the <i>Moorcock </i>14 PD 64 down to <i>Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd

v Cooper</i> [1941] AC 108, these authorities only say that a term should be implied if

business efficacy requires it.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83.    I do not see why it is necessary for

business efficacy to imply a duty on an owner to tell an architect what to do regarding

his certifying function. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84.    On the contrary, it would impede

business efficacy if an owner was obliged and entitled to tell an architect what to do

regarding his certifying function. It must not be forgotten that just as the architect may

be wrong in discharging his certifying function, it may be that the owner is wrong in his

assessment of whether the architect is or is not discharging his function properly. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85.    Furthermore, as it is accepted that

an architect, as certifier, must act fairly, impartially and independently, the owner is

not entitled to tell him what to do. An architect cannot act independently if the owner is

entitled to remove him and appoint someone else just because the owner believes that the

architect has failed to discharge his duty or has discharged his duty wrongly.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86.    However, if the architect is no

longer able to act as certifier because, for example, he has retired, then the owner may

and should appoint someone else in his place, see <i>Croudace Ltd v London Borough of

Lambeth</i> (1986) 33 BLR 25.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.    I find support for my view not only

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88.    In <i>Minster Trust Ltd v Traps

nature of the certifier’s function.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90.    In <i>Kempster v Bank of Montreal </i>[1871] 32 Up.Can Q.B. 87 (‘<i>Kempster</i>’), the plaintiffs were engaged to carry out

alterations and additions to the defendants’ banking house. Under their contract, the

defendants were to pay the plaintiffs the value of the works done to be fixed by the

defendants’ overseer.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91.    The plaintiffs alleged that it was

agreed that the defendants would procure the overseer to, and that he would, wherever the

plaintiffs were entitled to any such certificates, give such certificates.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92.    Chief Justice Draper pointed out

that the contract differed widely from what was contended for by the plaintiffs. He said

at p.94 and 95:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘This deed or agreement differs

  widely from that which is stated in the declaration…. It contains no covenant or

  agreement on the part of the defendants that they would cause or procure Hills to give the

  necessary certificates to entitle the plaintiffs to demand any payment, or would cause or

  procure Hills to estimate the value of extra work done; and therefore, so far as express

  covenant goes, the defendants have committed no breach in not procuring Hills to do either

  of these acts, the performing or withholding which were among the matters to be determined

  and adjusted by Hills without reference in any way to any other person. And the deed <u>does

  not afford any pretext for implying</u> such an agreement or duty on the part of the

  defendants, for there are express stipulations as to the giving of such certificates and

  making of such estimates, and no implication can arise where the contract is fully set

  out, for it would be at variance with what is fully set out. It is beyond doubt that both

  parties, as is said by Hannen, J., in <i>Jones v. St. John’s College,</i> L.R. 6

  Q.B., at p.127, intended "to rely on the fairness as well as the skill and judgment

  of" the surveyor, Hills; and, to borrow another phrase from the same judgment,

  "it seems to be impossible for the English language to supply words by which a man

  can bind himself, if this contract does not" bind the plaintiffs.’ <br/>

<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>93.    I refer next to <i>Hickman &amp; Co v Roberts </i>[1913] AC 229.

In that case, payment was to be made by the owners to the contractor on certificates to be

issued by the architect. It was found as a fact that the architect had allowed his

judgment to be influenced by the owners and the architect had improperly delayed issuing

various interim certificates and the final certificate.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94.    The contractor sued for the final

balance but the final certificate was not issued until after the commencement of the

action. The House of Lords held, inter alia, that the issue of the certificate was not a

condition precedent to the bringing of the action.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95.    I refer to the judgment of Lord Shaw

of Dunfermline where, at p.239, he says the following about the architect in that case:</font>
</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘… and I find that it is

  established, conclusively as I think, that he did not act with sufficient firmness to

  enable him to decide questions according to his own opinion, those questions affecting <u>the

  issue</u> of certificates and <u>the interim amounts</u> thereof. <u>Instead of doing so,

  my Lords, he accepted the instructions or orders of the owners</u> and their solicitors

  upon that topic.’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>96.    If an architect is to decide on the issue of certificates and the

amounts thereof without following the instructions or orders of the owners, then the

owners cannot be obliged or entitled to give such instructions or orders whether it be to

withhold a certificate, or, for that matter, to issue a certificate. The withholding and

the issue of a certificate are both sides of the same coin. Accordingly, an owner cannot

be liable for not giving such instructions or orders.</p></font> <u xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></u><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">97.    Indeed, should an architect

issue a certificate because he was told to do so by an owner, and not because he himself

thought it was right to do so, he would have ‘forfeited his independence’ (to

adopt the words of Lord Atkinson in <em>Hickman &amp; Co v Roberts</em> at p.238).</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98.    In my view, these three cases are

authorities against the implied term contended in the pleadings of the Respondents. The

case of <em>Lubenham </em>which was decided after <em>Panamena </em>and <em>Perini </em>is

also against such an implied term. I will refer to <em>Lubenham </em>later in greater

detail.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99.    Neither <em>Minster Trust </em>nor <em>Kempster

of the nature of the claim before the court there.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100.    As for the case of <em>Hickman

in different contexts. At p.124, it was cited in the context that one party had prevented

the performance of a term in the contract in question. At p.126, it was cited in the

context of collusion.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101.    Likewise, the judgment of Goddard

the Redfern Mail Exchange. The defendant was the building owner. The ‘General

Conditions of Contract’ applied. This was a document in a standard form used by the

defendant for the erection of buildings.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105.    The biggest part of the

plaintiff’s claim was in respect of applications for extension of time. </font></p>

that the Supreme Court of New South Wales would only be asked to decide points of law

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107.    Some of the applications for

extensions of time were made for delays to and disruption of the work caused by rain. Some

of the reasons given for refusing applications based upon rain were that the rain was

normal rain and should have been allowed for by the plaintiff when it submitted its

tender, that the policy of the Department of Works was not to grant extensions for normal

rain but only for abnormal rain and that the rain in fact did not delay the work. Reasons

of a similar character were given with respect to delays caused by industrial disputes.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108.    Macfarlan J decided that the

Director of Works was entitled to consider Departmental policy but was wrong if he

Respondents in the arbitration in respect of Items (a) to (d) that the Appellants had been

in breach of an implied term in the negative sense but in the positive sense. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113.    As for the implied term in the

positive sense, Macfarlan J said at p.111:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘I will now consider the affirmative

  aspect of the term which learned counsel for the plaintiff argued must be implied in this

  agreement. Fundamentally he argued it is essential to consider this aspect against the

  background that the Director of Works was at all times a <u>servant</u> of the

  Commonwealth; that the position he occupies as Certifier was part of the machinery set up

  by the agreement of the Commonwealth and the plaintiff for certifying applications for

  extension of time. As such a servant of the Commonwealth the Director of Works was obliged

  by law to obey all lawful orders of the Commonwealth: see Commonwealth Public Service Act

  1922, s.55(1)(a). If, for example, the Commonwealth were to say to the Director: "You

  are ordered to act in a particular manner", and if that order constituted a breach of

  the Contractual mandate conferred on him by cl.35, the Director would none the less be

  still obliged to act in compliance with the Commonwealth order. Against this background I

  will assume that the certifier, with the knowledge of both parties to the agreement, acted

  in breach of his obligation. Could the Commonwealth in those circumstances say: "I

  will not do anything to insure that he carries out these duties"? In my opinion an

  application of the test stated in <i>The Moorcock</i> (1889), 14 PB 64; would require the

  answer that the Commonwealth was <u>contractually bound to order him to carry out his

  duties</u>. In my opinion the plaintiff and the defendant, being the parties bound by his

  agreement, <u>are bound to do all co-operative acts necessary to bring about the

  contractual result. In the case of the defendant this is an obligation to require the

</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>115.    I note that these passages from <i>The Moorcock</i> do not state

what the implied term should be.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116.    In my view, it is a quantum leap to

say that an obligation to do all co-operative acts necessary to bring about the

contractual result would lead to the conclusion that an owner is bound to order a

certifier to carry out his duties. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117.    Furthermore, it is a contradiction

to say that, on the one hand, an owner must not interfere with the performance of a

certifier’s duties and yet, on the other hand, an owner must ensure that the

certifier performs his duties to the extent that the owner must tell the certifier what to

do if the owner believes the certifier to have defaulted in his duties.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118.    In my view, an owner has an implied

duty in the positive sense only to the extent that the owner must provide the certifier

with such information as the certifier requires. The owner may also make representations

to the certifier short of telling the certifier what to do.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119.    Thus, Hudson’s at para 6121

states:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘However, it is clearly natural and

  to be expected that both parties, contractor as well as owner, may in practice make

  representations to and communicate with the architect or certifier on the subject-matter

  of his decision. Whether such representations or communications amount to improper

  interference will depend upon whether they are of a character which recognises the

  independence of the certifier and his ultimate responsibility for making an impartial

  decision.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>120.    Even the judgment of Lord Blackburn in <i>Mackay v Dick</i>

[1881] 6 App Cas 251 at 263, which was cited by Macfarlan J (see paragraph 113 above),

does not lead to the conclusion that an owner is bound to order a certifier to carry out

his duties.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121.    An architect does not have to

require both the owner and the contractor to concur before he issues his certificate.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122.    Therefore, for example, when the

time comes to issue a final certificate under the standard conditions, an architect need

not seek the concurrence of the owner and the contractor thereto. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123.    There may well be a practical

reason why an architect would want to obtain such concurrence i.e. if both concur, then

neither will complain that the architect had erred in his final certificate. However

practicality must not be confused with legality. It is the architect’s legal duty to

issue certificates. It is not part of such a duty for him to seek concurrence from the

owner and the contractor. He may seek their responses but not their instructions. Also, he

is not to delay for an unduly long period the issuance of the certificate pending their

responses. If an architect sits by and waits for the owner and contractor to respond or to

concur, the architect would have failed to discharge his duty. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124.    Consequently, if an architect does

not want to make a decision on an intended certificate and hopes that an arbitrator will

decide it for him, the architect would not be carrying out his duty.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125.    Although Macfarlan J did cite <i>Minster

Trust</i> (at p.105 to 106) and <i>Hickman &amp; Co v Roberts</i> (at p.108 and 109), it

was in the context of whether a term should be implied and not what the term should be.

Furthermore, although Macfarlan J did cite various passages from Devlin J’s judgment

in <i>Minster Trust</i>, including the one that I cited in paragraph 88 above (see p.105

to 106 of the report on <i>Perini</i>), Marfarlan J did not seem to think that there was

any inconsistency between the proposition, on the one hand, that neither the owner and the

contractor is to seek to interfere with a certifier’s independence and, on the other

hand, imposing an obligation on the owner to tell the certifier what to do.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">126.   <i>Kempster</i> was not cited by

Macfarlan J.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">127.    It seems that although Macfarlan J

found that the Director was required to act independently, he was much influenced by the

fact that the Director was the servant of the owner.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">128.    This fact was noted a numbers of

times in his judgment. For example at p.98 to 99, he says:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘In considering the scope of the

  authority <u>it is essential to pay regard to the position of the Director of Works as it

  is seen apart from any special authority conferred upon him by the agreement</u>. As I

  have already described he is a Senior Commonwealth <u>servant</u> and is the Chief

  Executive Officer of the Department of Works for the State of New South Wales. His duties

  lie within the Department of Works and his subordinates are also within that Department.

  In exercising his administrative functions under the agreement he undoubtedly, as a <u>servant</u>

  of the Commonwealth, would need to have the interests of the Commonwealth to the fore and

  his actions <u>as such servant</u> would be to preserve or further those interests. He is

  also, of course, a public servant and as such subject to the duties and obligations of the

  provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. <u>If a Commonwealth public servant or

  a Minister of State having authority to do so were to give him an order</u> with respect

  to his duties, or the manner of performing them, <u>he would be obliged by law to obey</u>

  that order and would be liable to punishment if he did not do so. <u>The important

  relation of the Director of Works to the Department of Works</u> is emphasized by the

  contract which defines this title as meaning, "the officer howsoever styled who is in

  charge for the time being of the branch of the Department of Works in the State or

  Territory in which the works are to be executed". (See cl. 1, General Conditions of

  Contract.) Clause 1 also emphasizes that the expression ‘Director of Works’ is

  to have this meaning wherever it appears in the contract and it is, I think, of

  significance that this meaning is to be given without the common modification that often

  appears in Statutes in the following words: "unless the context shall otherwise

  require".’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">and at p.107 (when he was dealing with the

implied term in the negative sense):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘I have already held that the duty of

  the Director when acting as Certifier was to act independently and in the exercise of his

  would act in manners other than those upon which they have agreed and expressed in cl. 35

  and that it is a consequence of this assumption that they shall have impliedly bound

  themselves one to the other that they would not do anything that would prevent him from a

  proper discharge of the mandate which contractually they have granted to him. It is not

  necessary for any purpose of this case to decide whether the plaintiff is so bound but I

  am of the opinion that the defendant is, and that the obligation of the defendant in this

  respect is more clearly seen because it was <u>the employer</u> of the Director who in his

<p>131.    In considering whether an owner is obliged to tell a certifier

terms of the contract. </p></font>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">135.    In addition, the fact that the

certificate of the engineer or architect may be reviewed by an arbitrator and the fact

that the engineer or architect was nominated by one party, does not make the engineer or

architect, as certifier, an agent of the party engaging him (see North P’s judgment

at p.150 at lines 21 to 39).</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">136.    In the appeal before me, it was not

suggested that the Architect was not to act independently. Indeed its duty to act

independently, like those of many other firms of architects under standard terms as

certifier, is too well-established for any suggestion to the contrary to be attempted.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">137.    The close relationship between the

certifier and the owner was common in <i>Panamena</i> and in <i>Perini</i>.</font> </p>

<p>139.    In my view, the fact that a contractor may be entitled to claim

damages from the owner over and above the contract price for wrongful denial of extension

of time does not lead to the conclusion that the contractor can also claim damages against

the owner for interest for loss of use of money in the case of late issuance of

certificates or for wrongful amounts certified.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">140.    To claim damages against the owner

for wrongful denial of extension of time, a contractor need only establish that the

architect’s decision in refusing to extend time was wrong. To claim interest against

the owner for receiving money late, a contractor must establish that not only was the

architect wrong but that the owner was obliged to tell the architect what to do when the

architect acts as certifier. For the reasons I have stated, there is no such obligation to

tell. </font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">142.    The disputes arose out of interim

certificates issued by the architects. The certificates set out first the total value of

provided for by the contracts. However each certificate then also deducted a sum in

respect of alleged defective work up to date and a second sum in respect of liquidated

damages up to 20 May 1977 in respect of alleged delay.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">143.    It was subsequently common ground

  wished the architects to apply them when issuing their next interim certificates. The

  judge found as fact that liquidated damages were discussed at the meeting at the Council

  offices on 2 June 1977. He said, "<u>I do not think that Mr Halpin or anyone else,

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In all the circumstances, in our opinion

  none of these submissions can be made good in this case. In the first place, the facts of

  the <i>Panamena</i> were very different from those of the instant case, which makes it

  essential to discover the real <i>ratio</i> of the former. In the Court of Appeal Scott LJ

  based his decision first upon a term which he thought had to be implied in the contract

  between the shipowners and repairers that if and when it became known to the former that

  their surveyor was departing from his proper function under the contract, it then became

  their duty to stop him and tell him what his function was thereunder. In failing so to

  instruct their surveyor, the shipowners broke this implied undertaking and thus repudiated

  the contract. Upon this the repairers could have elected to rescind and claim damages, if

  they so chose; alternatively, on the principle <i>inter alia</i> of <i>Hickman Co v

  Roberts</i> [1913] AC 229, "The plaintiffs were entitled instead to treat the

  defendants as preventing the performance of the term in question, and also in waiving it

  as a condition precedent to the plaintiffs’ right to sue on the [Ministry]

  certificate": per Scott LJ at p124. Goddard LJ also effectively based his decision on

  a breach of an implied term when he said at p 127:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"It is and must be conceded that if a

    party desires to rely on the non-performance of a condition precedent he must do nothing

    to prevent the condition being performed, and if there is anything that must be done by

    him to render possible the performance of the condition, a failure by him to do what is

    required disentitles him from insisting on performance of the condition."</font></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In the House of Lords, Lord Thankerton,

<p>151.    As I have mentioned, it was Mr Teh’s alternative argument

that an owner is obliged to supervise the architect/certifier only if the owner knows that

the architect/ certifier is not discharging his function properly. Mr Teh referred not

only to <i>Panamena</i> and <i>Perini</i> for this proposition but also to paragraphs 43

and 44 of the judgment in C.A. No 85 of 1999 which state:</p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘43. We entirely agree with the

  learned judge that the employer could be liable for the default of the architect in

  issuing the interim certificates but only if the employer was aware of such default. This

  proposition of law is amply supported by authorities: <i>Frederick Leyland &amp; Co Ltd v

  Panamena Europea Navigacion </i>[1943] 76 Lloyd’s Rep 113 and <i>Perini Corporation v

  Commonwealth of Australia</i> (1969) 12 BLR 82. The pre-requisite of knowledge is

  essential before an employer is required to act to ensure that his architect complies with

  the terms of the building agreement between the employer and the contractor. The standard

  works on the subject have also reiterated this principle, e.g. Hudson on Building &amp;

  Engineering Contracts, Emden on Construction Law and Keating on Building Contracts.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">44. The rationale for this rule is

  obviously to take into account the special position of the architect in a building

  contract, even though he is employed and paid by the employer. When an architect acts as a

  certifier under a building contract for interim payments, he is to act fairly and

  impartially between the parties, and the employer is not to interfere with the

  architect’s exercise of this function. The arbitrator, in fact, recognised this point

  in his award. Such functions of the architect, among others, must be exercised by him

  independently as an expert. It would be unreasonable to expect a lay employer to warrant

  the performance of the architect in respect of such functions without establishing that

  the employer knew the architect had gone wrong: <i>Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co

  Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council &amp; Anor</i> (1986) 33 BLR 39 at 58.’</font></p>

<p>152.    Mr Teh suggested that the Court of Appeal had already determined

the extent of the duty of the Appellants vis--vis the Architect as certifier. Mr Chung

submitted likewise except that he argued that paragraph 43 of the judgment was applicable

to function (b) but not to function (a).</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">153.    In my view, the Court of Appeal did

not determine the extent of the duty of the Appellants vis--vis the Architect as

certifier. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was for leave to appeal to the High Court on

certain questions which the Court of Appeal eventually summarised into one question. That

question is set out in paragraph 55 of its judgment and reiterated in paragraph 8 above.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">154.    In deciding whether to grant such

leave, the Court of Appeal had to assess the prospects of success of the appeal if leave

to appeal was granted. This it did between paragraphs 39 to 50 of its judgment. Therefore,

paragraphs 43 and 44 of its judgment must be read in this context. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">155.    As for paragraph 50 of the judgment

of the Court of Appeal, this was cited by Mr Teh for his first argument that there is no

<blockquote xmlns="">

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">160.    In <em>Lubenham</em>, the

first to have the certificates corrected. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">161.    In the appeal before me, the issue

is not whether the Respondents are entitled to recover in an action before the court the

monies due to it in the absence of a certificate as apparently the certificates were

eventually issued, although they were allegedly delayed. The claim was for interest for

loss of use of the monies and was first made in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly,

the presence of an arbitration provision in the Conditions of Building Contract would not

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Thus, in the <i>Panamena</i> case,

  where the certifier had, on his own initiative, taken a wrong view of his terms of

  reference and refused a certificate for that reason, the prevention principle was again in

  the forefront of Lord Thankerton’s speech in the House of Lords, and, indeed,

  implicit in Goddard L.J.’s judgment in the Court of Appeal, quoted in paragraph (f) <i>infra</i>,

  and expressly approved on this point by Lord Thankerton. Unconsidered application of the

  prevention principle to very different situations may serve to distract attention from a

  closer analysis of the certifier’s own conduct as the reason for avoiding the

  certificate requirement. In the <i>Panamena</i> case there was as it happened, a close

  identity of interest between the surveyor and the owners.’</font></p>

state that while there will be an implied term that the architect will be independent and

impartial, there is no warranty as to his competence or that he will act reasonably, see

paragraphs 6097, 6112 to 6113 of Hudson’s.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">172.    For example, I cite paragraphs

6112 to 6113:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘6112 Given the

  "quasi-arbitral" nature of the certifier’s function, there must be an

  implied term that both parties will do nothing to prevent a true and unfettered exercise

  of his powers when certifying. Thus when discussing "the influencing of

  certifiers" Devlin J. said:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The main test appears to be whether

    the certificate is intended to embody a decision that is final and binding on the parties.

    If it is, it is in effect an award, and it has the attributes of its arbitral character.

    It cannot be attached on the ground that it is unreasonable, as the opinion of the party

    or the certificate of one who is merely an agent probably can. On the other hand, it must

    be made independently, for independence is the essence of the arbitral function. If two

    parties agree to appoint an arbitrator … it would be, I think, implied in the

    contract in order to give it business efficacy that neither side would seek to interfere

    with his independence. If a party to a contract is permitted to appoint his agent to act

    as arbitrator in respect of certain matters under the contract a similar term must be

    implied; but it is modified by the fact that a man who has to act as arbitrator in respect

    of some matter, and as servant or agent in respect of others, cannot remain as detached as

    a pure arbitrator should be."<sup>27 </sup></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>174.    Mr Chung also cited two sentences from the textbook, The

Malaysian Standard Form of Building Contract (1990) by Professor Vincent Powell Smith.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">175.    At p.144, it states, </font></p>

  issue interim certificates is a breach of contract for which the employer is liable.’</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The issue of the final certificate

  is mandatory and failure to issue it within the time and the manner specified is a breach

  of contract for which the employer is liable.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>177.    However no authority was cited to support these sentences which

were in any event vague. If the sentences are meant to suggest that a contractor may be

entitled to payment notwithstanding the absence of an interim or the final certificate, I

am in agreement with them. However if the sentences are meant to suggest that an owner is

obliged to tell the architect what to do and to ensure that the architect carries out his

certifying function, I would disagree for the reasons I have mentioned.</p></font><b xmlns=""><u>
<p></p></u> 

<p align="justify"><u><font face="Times New Roman">Particular wording of Clause 30</font></u></p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>178.    Clause 30(1) of the Conditions of Building Contract states:</p></font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘30(1) At the period of Interim

  Certificates named in the appendix to these Conditions, the Architect <u>shall</u> issue a

  certificate ….’ <br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>179.    Mr Chung further submitted that this meant that it was mandatory

for the Architect to issue the certificates and that the Appellants had warranted to the

Respondents that the Architect would issue the Interim Certificates on time. He argued

that the Architect was the alter ego of the Appellants. Presumably Mr Chung intended this

submission to apply to other certificates mentioned in Clause 30(4)(b) and (c) and 30(6)

as well where similar words had been used.</p></font> <u xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></u><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">180.    I am of the view that Mr

Chung’s submission based on the words in these various provisions is not valid. The

provisions may require the Architect to issue various certificates at various times but

they do not render the Appellants liable for the Architect’s obligation. Although the

Architect is not a party to the contract, the provisions make clear what is expected of

him. Furthermore, for reasons which I have mentioned already, the Architect, as certifier,

is not the agent nor is he the alter ego of the Appellants.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">181.    In addition, the Re-Amended Points

of Claim does not rely on the particular words in the provisions but on an implied term.</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font face="Times New Roman">Other points</font></u></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>182.    I should mention some other points.</p></font> <u xmlns="">
<p></p></u> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font face="Times New Roman">When the Interim Certificates should

have been issued</font></u></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>183.    Under the Conditions of Contract, the interim certificates were

to be issued monthly. There is no provision stating when such issuance should start and

whether the interim certificates should be issued at the beginning or at the end of each

month.</p></font> <u xmlns="">
<p></p></u><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">184.    What the Respondents did was to

use 2 February 1979 as the date when the first interim certificate should have been issued

and then it used the 2<sup>nd</sup> of every consecutive month thereafter as the due date

when each interim certificate should have been issued. The date of 2 February 1979 was

shortly after the date of the Contract which was 27 January 1979. Mr Chung was not able to

explain why 2 February 1979 should be the correct starting date for the interim

certificates to be issued.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">185.    Based on the approach I have

mentioned, the Respondents had alleged that the Architect had been late in issuing many

interim certificates whereas if a different starting date was used, the interim

certificates issued might not have been late or might not be as late as alleged. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">186.    In addition, there was the question

whether the duty of the Architect to issue the interim certificates was premised on an

implied term that the Respondents must submit detailed progress claims for the Architect

to make his decision. Mr Chung accepted that it was the practice in the industry for a

contractor to submit progress claims for the architect to issue interim certificates but

he submitted that there was no obligation on a contractor to do so. He submitted that an

architect must issue an interim certificate on the same day every month even if an

architect did not have sufficient information to issue the certificate or no work was

done. In those events, he submitted that an architect could issue an interim certificate

showing no amount payable to the contractor for the month but an interim certificate had

to be issued nevertheless. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">187.    Mr Chung further submitted that if

the issuance of the interim certificates was to be conditional upon the contractor

submitting detailed progress claims then this must be specifically provided for in the

contract as was the case in <em>China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd

v Leisure Park (Singapore) Pte Ltd </em><nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 622</nobr>. However I note that that case

does not decide the position when there is no specific term to that effect. I would have

thought that it would be an implied term that the issuance of the interim certificates was

to be conditional upon the contractor submitting detailed progress claims as an architect

does not issue interim certificates in a vacuum.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font face="Times New Roman">Does an architect, as certifier, owe a

duty of care to the contractor?</font></u></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>188.    Mr Chung submitted that if an owner is not liable for the

architect’s default, where the architect acts as a certifier, then a contractor may

have no recourse at all for the situation where certificates have been issued, but issued

late. He cited the case of <i>Pacific Associates v Baxter</i> [1990] 1 QB 993 for the

proposition that a certifier will not be liable in negligence to the contractor.</p></font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">189.    On the other hand, Mr Teh argued

that that case should be confined to its particular facts. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">190.    Whether that case should be

confined to its particular facts or not, I note that the English courts are less inclined

to find a duty of care for pure economic loss. See also <i>D&amp;F Estates Ltd &amp; Ors v

Church Commissions for England &amp; Ors</i> (1989) AC 177 and <i>Murphy v Brentwood

District Council</i> (1990) 2 All ER 908.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">191.    However, the position in Singapore

is different. For example, in <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v Ocean Front Pte

Ltd</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 113</nobr>, the Court of Appeal decided that a developer does owe a duty of

care to a Management Corporation to avoid pure economic loss. The Court of Appeal found

that there was a sufficient degree of proximity between the developer and the management

corporation in view of various factors. One of the factors was that the developer knew or

ought to have known that negligence in the construction of the common property would have

to be made good by the management corporation.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">192.    In <i>RSP Architects Planners &amp;

Engineers (Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No

1075 &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 449</nobr>, the Court of Appeal also decided that architects owe

a duty of care to a Management Corporation to avoid pure economic loss. Here, the Court of

Appeal found that the architects knew that the management corporation would depend on the

architects’ care and skill. The element of reliance by the management corporation on

the architects was present.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">193.    I think that a strong argument can

be made that an architect/certifier does owe a duty of care not only to the owner but also

to the contractor to avoid pure economic loss. An architect must know that both intend to

rely on his fairness as well as his skill and judgment as a certifier, as was mentioned in

<i>Jones v St John’s College</i> LR 6 QB and cited in <i>Kempster</i>, (see paragraph

92 above). See also the judgment of Bowen LJ in <i>Jackson v Barry Railway Co</i> (1893) 1

Ch 238 at p.247 which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <i>Nelson Carlton

Construction</i> at p.150 and 153. The architect must also know that if he is negligent in

issuing certificates he might cause loss to one of these parties.</font> </p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">194.    On the other hand, it may be argued

that because an architect as certifier is often considered as exercising a quasi-arbitral

or quasi-judicial function, he should owe no duty of care to the contractor when he

exercises that function. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">195.    I need say no more on this point as

it is not necessary for me to decide whether an architect, as certifier, owes a duty of

care to the contractor.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Contractual interest</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>196.    On another point, it is up to the industry to consider whether

the standard conditions should provide for contractual interest to be paid by an owner for

late issue of certificates by an architect not because the owner is entitled to tell the

architect what to do but because the owner has had the benefit of paying later.</p></font> <b xmlns=""><u>
<p></p></u> 

<p align="justify"><u><font face="Times New Roman">My Determination</font></u></p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>197.    The question posed by the Court of Appeal was regarding the

duties of the Appellants in relation to the certifying functions of the Architect. I

determine the question in the context of the claims as follows:</p></font> <font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    The Appellants have an implied duty

  not to interfere with the discharge of the Architect’s duty.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    The Appellants have an implied duty

  to do all things reasonably necessary to enable the Architect to discharge its duty

  properly. However, such an implied duty does not require the Appellants to order or tell

  the Architect what to do.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c)    Consequently, even if the Architect

  had failed to issue various certificates on time, or over-certified the retention sum, the

  Appellants are not liable for the Architect’s default, if any, even if the Appellants

  were aware of such defaults. Should I be incorrect on this point, and the Appellants are

  liable provided they are aware of such defaults, it is for the Respondents to plead and

  prove such awareness which they did not do.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d)    Therefore, the Appellants are not

  liable for interest if the Respondents received various sums of monies late by reason of

  the Architect’s default.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p>198.    In the circumstances, I allow the Appeal to the extent that the

Arbitrator’s award in respect of the first part of Item (a) and in respect of Items

(b) to (d) is set aside</p></font>
