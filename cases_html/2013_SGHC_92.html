<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned the determination of
                    ancillary matters relating to custody, care and control and access, maintenance
                    and division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff wife (“the wife”)
                    and defendant husband (“the husband”) were married on 7 March 2000
                    in India. The wife and husband are now permanent residents of Singapore. There
                    are two children of the marriage, a son born in February 2002 and a daughter
                    born in July 2007. The marriage lasted for about nine years before the parties
                    separated in December 2009. Subsequently, the wife commenced divorce proceedings
                    on 9 April 2010 and interim judgment was granted on 30 December
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I made the following orders on 15 and 18 January
                    2013:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Joint custody of the children of the
                        marriage with care and control to the wife. The husband’s access to
                        the children is set out in [17] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     The matrimonial property in Singapore (“the
                        matrimonial home”) is to be apportioned 60:40 in favour of the wife,
                        with an option for the wife to buy over the husband’s 40% share in the
                        property. Orders relating to the sale of the matrimonial property are set
                        out in [46] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     The property owned by the parties in India is to be sold and the sale
                        proceeds are to be divided equally, after deducting the repayment to the
                        wife of $28,425 and the costs and expenses of the sale (see also [47]
                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        parties’ three joint bank accounts are to be closed and the balance
                        therein divided equally. Parties are to retain all other assets in their own
                        names.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     Maintenance for the wife at $1.00 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_f"></a>(f)     Maintenance for the children at $4,000 per
                        month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_g"></a>(g)     Each
                        party to bear the legal costs of the ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_h"></a>(h)     Liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The wife has filed an appeal against the whole
                    of my decision made on 15 and 18 January 2013. I now give my grounds of
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody, care and control and access</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The children have been living with the wife
                    after the parties separated in December 2009. In the interim period pending the
                    determination of ancillary matters, the husband has had day access to the
                    children on Sundays from 11am to 5pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The parties agreed that there should be joint
                    custody of the children with care and control to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As for the issue of access, the husband wanted
                    day and overnight access to the children. Whilst the wife did not oppose day
                    access, she was not agreeable to the husband’s proposal for overnight
                    access once a month from Saturday 11am to Sunday 5pm and also during two weeks
                    of school holiday every year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The wife argued that any form of overnight
                    access was not appropriate for the children given the husband’s sexual
                    promiscuity and his tendency to view pornographic material at home. According to
                    the wife, she had caught the husband having an affair with a former domestic
                    helper, chatting with his ex-girlfriend, speaking to bar girls, watching
                    pornography on a regular basis, drinking excessively at night and so on. The
                    wife produced three supporting affidavits by third parties: an affidavit by her
                    sister stating that the husband had tried to molest her on numerous occasions,
                    an affidavit by a mutual friend detailing the husband’s extra-marital
                    affairs, and finally, an affidavit by another former domestic helper from India
                    (“the Indian domestic helper”) stating that the husband had made
                    sexual advances to her and also watched pornography at home in front of his
                    young son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In response, the husband argued that the
                    wife’s refusal to allow overnight access was unreasonable and would
                    inhibit bonding between the father and the children. The husband stated that
                    most of the wife’s assertions were untrue and grossly exaggerated, and in
                    any case irrelevant to the issue of overnight access to the children. According
                    to the husband, the wife was obsessive, had low self-esteem and often unfairly
                    accused him of having affairs. He pointed out that he has had day access to the
                    children since December 2009 without any incident. Moreover, he was only a
                    social drinker and did not drink excessively. As for his alleged “hyper
                    sexuality”, the husband produced a medical report by his psychiatrist
                    (“the husband’s psychiatrist”), which detailed the
                    husband’s depressive episode that occurred in 2007 and stated that no
                    symptoms of “hyper sexuality” were found in the husband (see [14]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The husband also denied the allegations made
                    in the three supporting affidavits produced by the wife. The husband stated that
                    his sister-in-law’s version of events was false; it was the wife who had
                    suggested that her sister stay with them and share their bed on one occasion,
                    and it was the sister who had displayed suggestive behaviour towards him. The
                    affidavits of the mutual friend and the Indian domestic helper were also denied
                    and denounced as biased and untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While these were the arguments put forward by
                    the parties, I was mindful that in deciding issues of custody, care and control,
                    and access, the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the children,
                    pursuant to s 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Women’s Charter”). The welfare of the child is to be
                    measured not only by money nor by physical comfort, but also by taking into
                    account the child’s moral and religious welfare, physical well-being and
                    the ties of affection between the child and parents (<em>Soon
                        Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 at [25], citing
                        <em>Rayden and Jackson’s Law and Practice in Divorce
                        and Family Matters</em> (Butterworths, 16<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed, 1991) at p 1004). Moreover, the court should promote joint parental
                    responsibility in custody proceedings, as it is in the best interests of a child
                    to have both parents involved in his or her life (<em>CX v
                        CY</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 at [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     This principle of joint parenthood is equally
                    applicable to access orders. As the Court of Appeal stated in <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As far as possible, the child should be allowed to interact with both
                        parents so that, despite the breakdown in relations between the parents, he
                        is assured, to the greatest extent possible, of a normal family life with
                        two parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the usual course of things, where care and control of the child is
                    granted to one parent, the other parent will be granted reasonable access to the
                    child. To deny the other parent such reasonable access will require convincing
                    evidence that the parent is incapable of caring for the child (see <em>Tay Ah Hoe (m.w.) v Kwek Lye Seng</em> [1996] SGHC
                    120).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Having regard to the principles traversed
                    above, on the issue of overnight access, a closer examination of the
                    wife’s evidence did not reveal sufficient basis to refuse overnight access
                    to the husband. For instance, the third party affidavits adduced by the wife
                    were of doubtful relevance and reliability. The wife’s sister and the
                    Indian domestic helper understandably had closer ties to the wife. The latter
                    was the daughter of a domestic helper who had served the wife’s family
                    back in India, and came from India to Singapore to work for the parties for a
                    year when the son was born in 2002 and again in 2006 for about half a
                        year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> According to the husband, the Indian
                    domestic helper’s affidavit was also unreliable as she was illiterate and
                    did not speak English. Moreover, her claim that the husband had openly watched
                    pornographic material in the son’s presence was six years ago in 2006. As
                    for the mutual friend, her affidavit simply recounted what she had heard from
                    the wife, and was thus unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The wife’s portrayal of the husband as
                    “hyper sexual” was denied by the husband, relying on the medical
                    report prepared by the husband’s psychiatrist, who had found no presence
                    of such a symptom.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Moreover, this
                    medical report covered numerous sessions with the husband from September 2007 to
                    April 2010, as well as seven marital counselling sessions attended by both
                    parties in 2007. The husband’s psychiatrist concluded that
                    “[h]ypersexual behaviour would be inconsistent with a depressive episode
                    as one would expect reduced sexual interest and behaviour during depressive
                    episodes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I accepted the husband’s argument that
                    if he were indeed “hyper sexual” as the wife claimed, the wife
                    would have raised issues regarding the husband’s sexual proclivity during
                    the marital counselling sessions, yet she did not do so. I also noted that the
                    wife’s counsel had written to the husband’s psychiatrist requesting
                    clarification of his medical report and suggesting that the husband actually
                    suffered from Bipolar disorder whereby “hypersexuality can co-exist with
                    depressive behaviour”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In that letter, counsel
                    for the wife also asked the husband’s psychiatrist to confirm that he
                    could not “preclude the possibility of hypersexuality” in the
                    husband. In his reply letter, the husband’s psychiatrist stated that there
                    was no evidence that the husband suffered from Bipolar disorder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the circumstances, the evidence adduced by
                    the wife did not persuasively show that the overnight access was risky or that
                    the children would be morally corrupted merely by spending one night a month and
                    two weeks of school holiday with the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, I granted the husband day and
                    overnight access to the children in terms of his proposal as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Every Sunday from 11am to
                        5pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Overnight
                        access from Saturday 11am to Sunday 5pm once a month;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Two weeks school holiday access either
                        in June or December every year with liberty to bring the children overseas
                        for holidays. This access shall take effect from December
                    2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     On alternate
                        public holidays from 11am to 5pm, commencing with Chinese New Year
                        2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        Deepavali day from 10am to 5pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_f"></a>(f)     On the eve of each child’s birthday for 3 hours
                        each in odd years; and on the day of each child’s birthday for 3 hours
                        each in even years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_g"></a>(g)     On the husband’s birthday for 3 hours;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_h"></a>(h)     The wife is to inform the husband of
                        any holiday plans with the children, together with an itinerary and contact
                        details. If the husband is bringing the children overseas, he is likewise to
                        follow this order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The parties both moved from India to Singapore
                    to work in 1999. In March 2000, they went back to India to get married and
                    returned to Singapore thereafter. A son was born to them in February 2002. In
                    mid-2003, the father found a job in Australia and the family relocated there
                    until February 2006, whereupon they returned to and settled down in Singapore.
                    The wife gave birth to the daughter in July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The husband is now 39 years of age and works
                    as a Sales Manager. In 2010, his gross monthly income was about $16,878.50
                    (gross yearly income of $202,541.65 divided by 12 months).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> During the marriage,
                    the husband was gainfully employed, except for two periods of time. The first
                    period was from March 2006 to September 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> (the wife
                    said it was from February 2006 to October 2006), after the husband lost his job
                    in Australia in February 2006. During this period, the husband suffered from
                    depression, for which he sought medical help. The second period of unemployment
                    was from October 2007 to January 2008. Since January 2008, the husband has been
                    working for his current employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The wife is now 37 years of age and is
                    employed as a Human Resource Manager. In 2010, her gross monthly income was
                        $12,116.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The wife also worked
                    full-time during the marriage, except on a few occasions. The wife was working
                    full-time when the parties got married in 2000. She went part-time for three
                    months in 2002 when the son was born, after which she resumed her job on a
                    full-time basis. When the family first relocated to Australia, she did not work
                    for one year from 2003 to 2004, but found employment in Australia between 2004
                    and 2006. When the family moved back to Singapore in February 2006, the wife was
                    unemployed for two months before she found another job in April 2006, which
                    required her to travel frequently. She stopped work again for about half a year
                    in 2007 due to her pregnancy with the daughter, but resumed work again in early
                    2008 until the present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The parties owned two immovable properties:
                    the matrimonial property in Singapore and a property in India (the “India
                    property”). The India property was purchased by the parties as joint
                    tenants in 2005 and fully paid up by November 2011. Although no formal valuation
                    of the India property was produced, parties agreed that the present value of the
                    India property should be regarded as $155,000 (using an exchange rate of 1 INR =
                    0.0225160 SGD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The matrimonial property in Singapore (the
                    “matrimonial property”) was purchased in September 2009 for
                    $1,865,000. It was registered in their names as tenants in common, with the wife
                    and husband holding 99% and 1% respectively. At the time it was purchased, the
                    matrimonial property was still under development. As at the date of the
                    declaration of the value of matrimonial assets, the estimated valuation of the
                    matrimonial property was approximately $2,550,000, according to an URA survey of
                    recent property transactions for the same development.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The parties
                    disagreed on the outstanding loan balance for the matrimonial property: the wife
                    claimed that the amount was $1,156,589.99 whereas the husband’s evidence
                    indicated that it was $1,385,406.23 instead. Nevertheless, at the final hearing
                    on 18 January 2013, counsel for the wife submitted a bank statement showing
                    $1,362,200.38 outstanding on the loan as of January 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> As this figure seemed
                    consistent with the husband’s position, I accepted it for the purposes of
                    these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The parties’ relationship began to
                    deteriorate in 2009, around the same time that the matrimonial property was
                    purchased. The parties’ marriage had been strained since 2006 as a result
                    of the husband’s depression, and became even more so in September 2009
                    when the wife accused the husband of having an affair with their domestic helper
                    at that time. On 30 December 2009, the wife asked the husband to leave their
                    home (at that time, parties were living in rental accommodation). She then
                    commenced divorce proceedings in April 2010. The wife and children subsequently
                    moved into the matrimonial property in July 2010 when the development was
                    completed. Since July 2010, the wife has been paying the monthly cash
                    instalments, property tax and maintenance for the matrimonial
                        property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Direct contributions to the matrimonial property and India
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Both parties made direct contributions toward
                    the acquisition of the matrimonial property, although the wife’s direct
                    contributions were greater. The down-payment was partly financed by CPF funds
                    from both parties. The remainder of the down-payment, option fee, legal fees and
                    stamp duty were paid out of one of the wife’s Standard Chartered Bank
                    (“SCB”) accounts. The monthly mortgage instalments were paid using
                    CPF funds of both parties, as well as cash contributions from another SCB
                    account under the wife’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There were two further issues in relation to
                    the parties’ direct contributions toward the matrimonial property. First,
                    the husband repaid to the bank the sum of $44,944.50 in October 2009 for a
                    personal loan taken out by the wife for the down payment of the matrimonial
                    property. The wife did not dispute this but argued that this was a gift to her
                    which should not be taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets. I
                    did not find this argument convincing. Even if this sum <em>was</em> a gift (which the husband contested), this did not preclude
                    it from being taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets (see
                        <em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</em> [1996] 1
                    SLR(R) 633 at [12]–[13] and <em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow
                        Kee</em> [2012] 4 SLR 405 where inter-spousal gifts are assets that go
                    into the pool of matrimonial assets for division). The second issue related to
                    the actual source of funds in the wife’s SCB accounts that were used for
                    cash contributions towards the matrimonial property. The wife’s case was
                    these funds represented her personal savings. Conversely, the husband asserted
                    that the wife’s SCB accounts actually contained family savings, pursuant
                    to an understanding between the parties that he would pay for household expenses
                    while the wife’s income would be saved for the family. As such, he argued
                    that half of the contributions towards the matrimonial property made out of the
                    wife’s SCB accounts should be attributed to him. For the sake of argument,
                    even if the funds in the wife’s SCB accounts were not savings for the
                    family, it could be argued that the husband had made <em>indirect</em> financial contributions which enabled the wife to amass
                        <em>her own</em> savings in her SCB accounts to finance
                    the matrimonial property for the benefit of the family as a whole. I will thus
                    deal with this below, in the context of indirect financial
                contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As such, the parties’ direct financial
                    contributions towards the matrimonial property as at January 2013 were as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I noted that apart from the above
                    contributions, the wife had also been paying the property tax and conservancy
                    fees since July 2010, which amounted to about $14,000 in total.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> However, it should similarly
                    be noted that the wife had been occupying the matrimonial property to the
                    exclusion of the husband since July 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>, which was a factor to be taken account in the
                    division of the same under s 112(2)(f) of the Women’s
                Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for the India property, the parties had
                    made equal contributions towards the monthly instalment payments until December
                    2009 when they separated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> From January 2010
                    to February 2011, the wife paid for the monthly instalments which totalled
                    $6,885.75 (INR 305,816), as well as the maintenance and utility bills of
                    $1,039.79 (INR 46,180) in total.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> In November
                    2011, the wife paid $18,518.90 to extinguish the housing loan for the India
                    property in order to avoid the high interest rates, and also paid an additional
                    $1,981.41 in maintenance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> While the
                    husband argued again that the monthly instalments and maintenance charges from
                    January 2010 to February 2011 were met by the wife from family savings as well
                    as a sum of $22,000 that he had transferred to her SCB account in November
                        2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, these arguments were better addressed in the
                    context of the husband’s indirect financial contributions towards the
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Manner of holding for the matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As noted above, the parties owned as tenants
                    in common, with the wife holding a 99% share. The parties disagreed on the
                    impact of this manner of holding. According to the wife, the parties had agreed
                    that in event of a sale of the matrimonial property or a divorce, she would be
                    entitled to 99% of the property and the husband would only receive a 1%
                        share.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The wife’s
                    version of events was that the husband had initially intended for her to own
                    100% of the matrimonial property to make up for his infidelities, however the
                    parties were advised that the husband had to hold at least 1% of the property in
                    order for him to continue his CPF contributions towards the purchase price. The
                    husband, on the other hand, disagreed with the wife’s account and claimed
                    that she had coerced and blackmailed him into giving her a 99% share of the
                    matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Regardless of the parties’ views, the
                    registered holding of the parties for whatever reasons is immaterial and
                    irrelevant in the context of a division of matrimonial property under s 112(2)
                    of Women’s Charter. In other words, the law on division of matrimonial
                    assets is not dependent on the proprietary interest of the parties. Section
                    112(2) of the Women’s Charter is concerned with the personal rights (as
                    distinct from proprietary rights) of the parties in relation to the matrimonial
                    property. In <em>Ho Kiang Fah v Toh Buan</em> [2009] 3
                    SLR(R) 398, the following observations were made (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A distinction must be drawn between [the defendant’s]
                        proprietary rights and personal rights. Section 112 does not seek to declare
                        or confer proprietary rights on a spouse where there are none. It must be
                        remembered that the court’s powers under s 112 to divide assets
                        extends to those subsisting in the sole or joint names of the parties at the
                        time of the hearing of ancillary matters. It is the spouse’s personal
                        rights as distinct from proprietary rights in relation to the matrimonial
                        assets that the court adjudicates in ancillary proceedings applying the
                        principles of a just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The wife raised two alternative arguments in
                    support of her position that the manner of holding should be reflected in the
                    division of the matrimonial property, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     This would give effect to the
                        parties’ settlement or agreement on the division of the matrimonial
                        property in the event of a divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     Alternatively, the husband had gifted to her his share of
                        the matrimonial property except for 1%. That is, all of the husband’s
                        contribution to this property, aside from 1%, was a gift to the
                    wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I did not find the wife’s arguments
                    convincing. There was no written document before me indicating a marital
                    agreement in contemplation of divorce as described by the wife; there was only a
                    “Letter of Confirmation on Manner of Holding” signed by the
                    parties confirming that their lawyers had explained to them the nature and
                    effect of their manner of holding the matrimonial property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In any case, even if
                    there <em>was</em> an agreement between the parties, this
                    would only constitute a factor to be taken into account in the division of
                    matrimonial assets and would be subject to the overriding consideration of what
                    is just and equitable in the circumstances (<em>TQ v TR and
                        another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 at [73]–[75]; <em>AFS v AFU</em> [2011] 3 SLR 275 at [18]). As for the
                    wife’s second alternative argument, this was insufficiently substantiated
                    and in any case immaterial for the same reasons at [28] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Recently, the Singapore Court of Appeal in
                        <em>BCB v BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324 (“<em>BCB v BCC</em>”) cautioned against placing undue
                    emphasis on <em>direct</em> contributions and emphasized
                    that “<em>indirect</em> contributions of <em>every</em> stripe should be taken <em>fully</em> into account” [emphasis in original] (<em>BCB v BCC</em> at [8] and [11]). Moreover, it was noted in
                    that case that the indirect contributions of <em>both</em>
                    the husband as well as wife should be given their full value (<em>BCB v BCC</em> at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I will first deal with the indirect financial
                    contributions. As discussed above at [28], the husband’s case was that the
                    parties’ financial arrangement was that the husband’s income would
                    be used for household expenses whilst his remaining income and the wife’s
                    income would be savings for the family. The parties had opened a joint account
                    with DBS bank (the “DBS Savings joint account”) in 2006. The
                    husband claimed that his salary and bonuses went into this DBS Savings joint
                    account, which was used to pay for household expenses and even the wife’s
                    income tax, whereas the wife’s income went into her personal SCB account,
                    which was used to pay for the parties’ properties. The wife denied the
                    existence of such a financial arrangement. She argued that the DBS Savings joint
                    account was solely funded by her during the husband’s two periods of
                    unemployment in 2006 and 2007, and that her salary only went into her personal
                    account in 2007 when the husband found a job. Additionally, she claimed that the
                    husband’s lack of savings was due to his lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I was satisfied that the household and
                    family’s expenses were primarily borne by the husband, although the wife
                    also did her share, especially when the husband was unemployed. There was little
                    documentary evidence pertaining to the period of marriage prior to 2006, as the
                    parties only moved back to Singapore then. Nevertheless, the wife’s
                    evidence in her affidavits seemed to indicate that the family primarily relied
                    on the husband’s income.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> For instance, she stated
                    that she returned to work in 2004 in order to supplement the husband’s
                    income, which was insufficient for their family and household
                        expenditures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                    The husband’s bank statements from October 2007 to December 2009 indicated
                    that his salary and bonuses (including a $138,000 bonus in September 2009) were
                    indeed deposited into the parties’ DBS Savings joint account, which was
                    also used for various living expenses (such as grocery expenses and utility
                    bills) and the wife’s income tax payments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> There were no deposits
                    by the wife during this period. In particular, the husband had also paid the
                    down payment of approximately $23,460 for the wife’s car<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> and transferred a sum of
                    $22,000 to the wife’s SCB account in November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As for the wife, I found that she had also
                    contributed to the household expenses, albeit to a lesser extent than the
                    husband. I accepted her evidence that she had supported the household during the
                    husband’s two periods of unemployment (for about 5 months in 2006 and 3
                    months in late 2007)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>, but noted that she could not have borne
                    the bulk of the family and household expenses given that she must have
                    contributed more than $400,000 towards the matrimonial property and the India
                    property despite consistently earning less than the husband. Indeed, it seemed
                    that she retained her own income and used it to pay for the parties’
                    properties, whereas the husband’s income went into their joint account to
                    be used by <em>both</em> parties for their daily expenses
                    including the family and household expenditures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As for non-financial contributions, I noted
                    that both parties were working parents for most of the marriage and the children
                    and household were generally cared for by domestic helpers. There was the Indian
                    domestic helper to look after the son from mid-2002 to May 2003. The Indian
                    domestic helper returned to work for the family again in June 2006 when the
                    parties moved back to Singapore. Since then, the family has always hired a
                    domestic helper; the present helper now lives with the wife and children. I
                    noted that the wife had mostly worked full-time during the marriage. In
                    particular, her job from April 2006 to end 2007 was a regional role which
                    required her to travel often. For this period of time especially, she must not
                    have been able to spend much time at home looking after the children or
                    household. Nevertheless, I found that the wife was generally in charge of the
                    household and was also the son’s primary caregiver from 2003 to 2004,
                    during which the parties were living in Australia without a maid and only the
                    husband was working. As for the husband, I accepted that he had also helped out
                    with the children and household chores whenever he could. In particular, he
                    helped the wife look after the son in Australia during the time when both
                    parties were working and there was no maid to care for the son. That being said,
                    it was also evident that he was less involved with the children and household
                    than the wife, especially when he suffered from depression after losing his job
                    in Australia in February 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The wife did not want the matrimonial property
                    to be sold and requested that the husband transfer his 1% in the matrimonial
                    property to her for nominal or no consideration. Her first two arguments in
                    support of her position were that her 99% share represented the parties’
                    divorce settlement or alternatively, a gift by the husband to her, both of which
                    I have already rejected. Her last argument was that she was entitled to the
                    matrimonial property in light of her direct contributions to this property as
                    well as her indirect contributions. Additionally, the wife submitted that if her
                    proposal for division of the matrimonial property was accepted, she would
                    relinquish all claims to the husband’s personal assets; however, she
                    wanted 25% of the husband’s personal assets if her proposal was rejected.
                    As for the India property, the wife requested that it be sold and that she be
                    awarded 70% of the net sale proceeds after refunding to her the sums of
                    $18,518.90 and $1,981.41, being the sums paid by her towards this property from
                    February 2011 onwards. Finally, the wife submitted that the other jointly owned
                    assets (<em>ie</em>, the three joint bank accounts) should
                    be divided equally between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The husband proposed that the matrimonial
                    property be sold in the open market and the net sale proceeds divided in the
                    ratio 56:44 in his favour. Alternatively, the husband suggested that the wife be
                    given the option to purchase his share in the property. As for the India
                    property, the husband proposed that the property be sold and the net sale
                    proceeds be divided equally between the parties or alternatively that the wife
                    purchase his 50% share at market value. Finally, the husband proposed that each
                    party would retain all other assets in their respective names.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This case concerned a 10-year long marriage in
                    which both parties were working for most of the marriage and had two children.
                    The wife was undoubtedly the party who made greater financial contributions
                    towards the matrimonial assets. She was responsible for 73.2% of the direct
                    financial contributions towards the matrimonial home and had also solely
                    financed the India property after the parties’ separation in December
                    2009. On the other hand, the husband was primarily the one who paid for the
                    daily household expenses and the children’s education at an international
                    school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The facts here bore certain similarities
                    (except for the length of the marriage) to those in <em>BCB v
                        BCC</em> (see [36] above), which concerned a 15-year long marriage
                    where both parties were working and had children. Similar to the present
                    situation, the wife in <em>BCB v BCC</em> had made a
                    greater direct financial contribution to the matrimonial assets while the
                    husband had contributed towards the family’s welfare, both financially and
                    non-financially (<em>BCB v BCC</em> at [16]). The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>BCB v BCC</em>, after comprehensively
                    surveying other relevant decisions concerning broadly similar facts, allowed the
                    appeal and granted the husband a 40% share of the parties’ two immovable
                    properties. Central to this decision was the finding that the husband did
                    contribute <em>substantially to the family’s
                        expenses</em> and that the Judge below had accorded <em>too much emphasis</em> to the <em>direct</em>
                    financial contributions of the parties (<em>BCB v BCC</em>
                    at [36]–[37]). The Court of Appeal emphasized that indirect contributions
                    of every stripe, whether by husband or wife, should be taken fully into account
                        (<em>BCB v BCC</em> at [11]–[12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In my judgment, the holding in <em>BCB v BCC</em> is instructive in the present case. No doubt,
                    the marriage here (10 years) was shorter than that in <em>BCB</em> (15 years), and the husband in <em>BCB v
                        BCC</em> was found to have been as much involved in the upbringing of
                    the children as the wife (<em>BCB v BCC</em> at [5]),
                    unlike in the present case. Nevertheless, the wife’s proposal that she
                    receive the whole of the matrimonial property and 70% of the net sale proceeds
                    from the India property was clearly inequitable, in light of the husband’s
                    direct and indirect financial contributions as well as the fact that the wife
                    has been living in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the husband since
                    July 2010. I found the husband’s proposal that he receive 56% and 50% of
                    the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial property and the India property
                    respectively more reasonable in comparison to the wife’s proposal, but
                    still not fair and equitable as the wife, on the whole, had made greater
                    contributions to the marriage than the husband. In the final analysis, taking a
                    broad-brush approach and considering all the circumstances of the case, I found
                    that a just and equitable division would be to divide the matrimonial property
                    in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the wife, and to divide the net sale proceeds
                    from the India property equally <em>after</em> repayment to
                    the wife of $28,425, being the total sum of the monies paid by the wife towards
                    the India property from January 2010 onwards (see [31] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Accordingly, I ordered the matrimonial
                    property to be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The wife is entitled to 60% and the
                        husband is entitled to 40% of the matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The parties are to obtain a valuation
                        of the property as at the date of this order. The expense of the joint
                        valuation is to be borne by the parties equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     The wife is to inform the husband of
                        her decision whether to buy over his 40% share in the property within two
                        (2) weeks of the valuation report.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     If the wife does not wish to buy over the husband’s
                        share in the property, the property is to be sold in the open
                    market.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the wife
                        buys over the husband’s share in the property, she shall pay the
                        husband 40% of the net value of the property (<em>ie</em> valuation less outstanding loan) and the husband is to
                        refund his own CPF all sums utilized with accrued interest from the money
                        received from the wife. The wife is to service the mortgage loan after the
                        transfer. The wife shall bear the costs and expenses of the
                    transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_f"></a>(f)     In the
                        event of a sale of the property in the open market, the sale proceeds shall
                        first be utilized to repay the outstanding mortgage and cost and expenses of
                        sale, and the net balance thereafter is to be divided in the proportion 60%
                        to the wife and 40% to the husband. Each party shall refund their respective
                        CPF accounts of all monies utilized plus accrued
                interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I also ordered the India property at to be
                    divided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     The property is to be sold in the
                        open market and the sale proceeds shall first be utilized to repay the sum
                        of $28,425 to the wife, costs and expenses of sale, and thereafter the net
                        balance shall be divided equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Further, I granted both parties conduct of
                    sale of the matrimonial property and the India property. As for the monies in
                    the parties’ three joint bank accounts, these monies were not very
                    significant and I thus ordered the accounts to be closed and the monies therein
                    to be divided equally between the parties. Finally, I ordered each party to
                    retain all other assets in their sole name, given that there was little
                    difference in value between the husband’s and the wife’s personal
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There was an existing interim maintenance
                    order made in November 2010, under which the husband was to pay $3,500.00 in
                    monthly maintenance for the children and $1.00 in monthly maintenance for the
                        wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> As the wife was
                    agreeable to receiving nominal maintenance, I ordered the husband to pay
                    maintenance of $1.00 to the wife with effect from 1 February 2013 and thereafter
                    on the first of every month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As for maintenance for the children, the first
                    issue was whether the two children’s expenses as claimed by the wife were
                    reasonable. The wife claimed that the children’s total expenses were
                    $9,729 per month, which comprised the children’s direct expenses of
                    $4,240, half of the car expenses at $1,100 (50% of $2,200), and a two-third
                    share of household expenses at $2,744.67 (2/3 of $4,117, deducting a one-third
                    share for the wife’s parents who were living with her).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The husband, on the other
                    hand, argued that the wife had grossly exaggerated the children’s expenses
                    in order to claim a higher maintenance from him. For instance, regarding the
                    monthly household marketing expenses claimed by the wife at $2,000, the husband
                    argued that this should only be $750; $2,000 was exaggerated as it probably
                    included expenses for the wife’s parents and the family usually ate
                    vegetarian meals at home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> According to the husband, the
                    children’s total expenses were $7,094 instead, comprising their direct
                    expenses of $2,764, car expenses of $1,950, and household expenses of
                        $2,380.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Taking into account the children’s
                    standard of living during the marriage, I was of the opinion that their expenses
                    as claimed by the wife were indeed exaggerated. The two children are now aged 11
                    and 5 and attend an international school in Singapore. They have been amply
                    provided for by their parents, who have mostly held well-paying jobs, especially
                    in recent years. They were taken care of by a domestic helper, brought out on
                    weekends for meals and went on regular holidays abroad. In these circumstances,
                    the children’s expenses could not be insignificant. As an illustration, it
                    was not disputed that the children’s school fees alone cost $2,000 a
                    month. Nevertheless, the wife’s claimed expenses for the children of
                    almost $10,000 a month was excessive, especially given their young age. I noted
                    the extensive nature of the wife’s list of expenses for the children,
                    which covered everything from utility bills, to the salary for the domestic
                    helper, to petrol expenses and road tax, and even to expenses towards birthday
                    gifts for parties attended by the children. In comparison, the husband’s
                    list of expenses was more reasonable and even slightly generous to the wife,
                    given that he had not divided overhead expenses such as for the car and for the
                    domestic helper, which were, strictly speaking, not for the children’s
                    benefit only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I next considered the parties’
                    respective positions. The wife asked for $6,000 in maintenance for the children,
                    in proportion to the parties’ declared incomes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> She submitted that as the husband earned
                    approximately 60% of the parties’ total incomes, he should be made to bear
                    a proportionate amount of the children’s expenses. On the other hand, the
                    husband proposed $3,000 per month in maintenance for the children. He argued
                    that he could only afford $3,000 because of his significant personal expenses
                    and debts, which amounted to more than $17,000 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The wife, however, countered
                    that $6,000 was well within his means. She pointed out that the some of the
                    husband’s personal expenses were inflated or unnecessary, such as utility
                    charges of $250 and his rental expenses of $2800. The wife also highlighted that
                    the husband’s expenses in fact exceeded his income, which indicated that
                    he must be using his bonuses to pay the difference.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Taking into account all the relevant
                    circumstances, I was satisfied that the husband had a greater earning capacity
                    than the wife and should thus bear a greater proportion of the children’s
                    expenses. In 2010, the husband’s stated gross monthly income was
                        $16,878.50<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>,
                    however his total gross monthly income (including bonuses) was in fact
                    $25,584.75, as reflected in his income tax declaration for that
                        year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the
                    wife’s gross monthly income as of 2010 was only $12,116.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> While I think that the
                    husband’s expenses were on the high side, he, nevertheless, failed to
                    justify why he should be ordered to pay only $3,000 in maintenance given his own
                    calculation of $7,094 for the children’s expenses. Moreover, the sum of
                    maintenance that he was proposing to pay was $500 less than in the interim
                    maintenance order made in November 2010. Thus, I ordered the husband to pay the
                    wife the sum of $4,000.00 per month as maintenance for the children with effect
                    from 1 February 2013 and thereafter on the first of every subsequent
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I ordered each party to bear their respective
                    legal costs and gave parties liberty to apply.</p>
