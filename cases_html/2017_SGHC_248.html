She first struck out the claim against the third defendant because it was a company that had never any interest in the Property. The plaintiffs’ counsel also accepted during the hearing before the AR that the plaintiffs had no clear cause of action against the third defendant. The AR therefore considered the action against the third defendant to be unsustainable and struck it out.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The AR also struck out the plaintiffs’ claim against the first and second defendants on three grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 First, the claim was time-barred under the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). The AR considered that s 29 of the Limitation Act applied. Section 29(1) provides that the limitation period for an action based on the defendant’s fraud would not start to run until “the plaintiff has discovered the fraud … or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it”. Nonetheless, the AR found that the plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred because the plaintiffs either discovered or could have discovered the alleged fraud with reasonable diligence by 1994 at the latest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 This was because of the correspondence between Syed Jafar on the one hand, and the Registrar and the second defendant on the other. The correspondence showed that Syed Jafar had inquired with the Registrar about a “wrong lodgement” of a certificate of title in favour of the second defendant. The Registrar investigated and stated that the Property’s title did not vest in Syed Ahmat. The lawyers of the Aljunied Trust wrote to the second defendant informing him that proceedings would be commenced “immediately” to expunge the certificate of title and to reclaim possession of the Property. Although the plaintiffs alleged that they did not know about the correspondence, the AR considered this irrelevant as the plaintiffs commenced the proceedings in their capacity as trustees. Hence, Syed Jafar’s actions and knowledge were also imputed to the plaintiffs, the present trustees and they could be taken to have discovered the relevant facts in 1994. The time limitation under ss 9–10 of the Limitation Act for actions in relation to land interests is 12 years. The plaintiffs therefore had to commence the action by 2006, but they did not. Accordingly, the claim was time-barred.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Second, the AR also considered the claim barred by the defence of laches. The AR considered evidence that a caveat lodged by the former trustees of the Property against the Property in 1994 had been allowed to lapse. Further, at the time of the 2000 conveyance, the Registrar’s 2001 letter gave Syed Jafar notice that unless the Registrar heard from him within 14 days, the caveat lodged by the Registrar would be withdrawn, and the transfer of the Property from the second defendant to the first defendant would be registered (see [6] above). Syed Jafar failed to respond. The Registrar’s caveat was hence withdrawn and the first defendant was registered as the Property’s owner. The plaintiffs did not explain their inaction and only referred to an affidavit by Syed Jafar dated 29 May 2017 where he stated that he did not receive the Registrar’s 2001 letter. The AR was not convinced and found that the defence of laches applied because of the immense time delay.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Third, even if the claim was not time-barred and the defence of laches did not apply, the AR held that the plaintiffs could not go behind the land register to challenge the first defendant’s registered title. Since the Property was regulated by the LTA, any challenges by the plaintiffs would need to fall within one of the limbs of s 46(2) of the LTA. The plaintiffs relied on s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which required fraud “to which that proprietor or his agent was a party or in which he or his agent colluded”. However, the AR found that nothing in the plaintiffs’ evidence satisfactorily explained how the first defendant or his agent was party to or colluded in any kind of fraud. Instead, any fraudulent intention was on Kavena’s part, since he was the one who transferred the Property a second time even after the first transfer to Jayna was successful. Since the plaintiffs produced no evidence to link the alleged fraud to the first defendant, s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) did not apply.

They submitted that the first defendant (the current registered proprietor) should have made further inquiries about the Hindoo Temple Trustees’ previous conveyances, since the 1977 conveyance was assisted by the same solicitors on both sides. Further, the first defendant was the lessee of the neighbouring plots of land, such as 116 and 118 Dunlop Street. Thus, the first defendant knew or ought to have known that the plaintiffs were the owners of these neighbouring plots of land (pursuant to the conveyances set out at [3] above). Accordingly, the defendants ought to have known and inquired about the fact that the defendants’ disputed title to the Property did not derive from a conveyance by either the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs’ predecessors. Even though the first defendant’s title was not directly conveyed by the Hindoo Temple Trustees, the plaintiffs argued that the first defendant should still be taken to have knowledge of the 1977 conveyance: “since the [first defendant] is the son of the [second defendant], the [first defendant] ought to have knowledge from his father”, the previous owner of the Property.

They submitted that this title was “an equitable one” which existed independently from any other interest, including the title under the LTA, and therefore required a disposition in writing before the Property could be transferred (s 7(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)). As there was no such disposition in writing, the Property’s common law title still remained with the plaintiffs.

First, the claim can be struck out on this ground if it is legally unsustainable in the sense that the plaintiff would not get the relief sought even if he succeeded in proving all the facts that he alleges.

Section 10(1) of the Limitation Act then became relevant:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Accrual of right of action in case of present interests in land</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">10.</span>—(1) Where the person bringing an action to recover land or some person through whom he claims has been in possession thereof and has, whilst entitled thereto, been dispossessed or discontinued his possession, the right of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the dispossession or discontinuance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Under s 9(1) read with s 10(1), time started to run on the date of the dispossession, which was when the right of action was “deemed to have accrued”. This would be on 6 September 1895 when Kavena conveyed the Property to the Hindoo Temple Trustees. Kavena had already conveyed the Property to Jayna in 1879 who had in turn conveyed it to Syed Allowei in 1882 who then conveyed it to Syed Ahmat in 1892. Hence, it was Kavena’s subsequent conveyance to the Hindoo Temple Trustees that would have “dispossessed” the land from its rightful owners. Accordingly, the 12-year limit would have elapsed by 1907. The claim is now more than 100 years over the limitation period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, as I noted earlier, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants participated in or knew of certain fraudulent conveyances. Even assuming that the plaintiffs’ case of fraud was made out, their action would still have been time-barred. The relevant portions of s 29 of the Limitation Act provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postponement of limitation period in case of fraud or mistake</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">29.</span>—(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent or of any person through whom he claims or his agent;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as aforesaid; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake, as the case may be, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Nothing in this section shall enable any action to be brought to recover, or enforce any charge against, or set aside any transaction affecting, any property which —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in the case of fraud, has been purchased for valuable consideration by a person who was not a party to the fraud and did not at the time of the purchase know or have reason to believe that any fraud had been committed; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the case of mistake, has been purchased for valuable consideration, subsequently to the transaction in which the mistake was made, by a person who did not know or have reason to believe that the mistake had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Assuming there was fraud, the time period began to run when the plaintiffs had either “discovered” the fraud or “could with reasonable diligence have discovered it”. I agreed with the AR and found that the plaintiffs either knew about the fraud or should have discovered it with reasonable diligence in 1994, which means that its claim was time-barred from 2006.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The plaintiffs’ own position, as stated in their amended statement of claim, was that Syed Jafar was the trustee of the Aljunied Trust until 1998, when one Sharifah Fatimah Binte Abdul Kader Aljunied and the first plaintiff were appointed as trustees by a court order dated 10 February 1998.

The Registrar explained that the Registry of Deeds was obliged to register deeds presented to it as long as the deeds complied with the formal requirements. In other words, the fact that Syed Jafar’s search of the Registry of Deeds disclosed deeds registering Syed Ahmat’s interest against the parcel of land where the Property was situated did not mean that title in the Property had in fact vested in Syed Ahmat. The Registrar’s investigations into transactions prior to Syed Ahmat’s death showed that the Property did not vest in Syed Ahmat.

First, it shows that Syed Jafar was all along aware of the second defendant’s initial claim to the Property, and the first defendant’s subsequent claim to the Property during the 2000 conveyance. Second, Syed Jafar did not object on grounds that, for instance, he had to investigate further. Rather, he already knew the grounds of his objection and was prepared to begin proceedings to vindicate Syed Ahmat’s interest. But he did not. Syed Jafar sat on his hands despite his <span class="font-italic">own</span> assertion that he would begin proceedings. The estate could not be allowed to revive his wish to commence proceedings more than 20 years later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The plaintiffs’ argument against this chain of events was twofold.

</div> where he explained that the Registrar’s 2001 letter was not received by his company because the company’s address had changed from the address stated in the caveat he had filed. No documentary evidence was attached to Syed Jafar’s affidavit to support this claim. More importantly, it was incumbent on Syed Jafar to provide an accurate address and update his address if there were changes so that he would be contactable by the Registrar. The Registrar could only proceed on the basis that the address stated on the caveat was the accurate one. Hence, I did not accept Syed Jafar’s convenient explanation that he did not receive the Registrar’s 2001 letter. Even if he did not have actual sight of the letter, this was due to his own fault and should not be held against the Registrar. Furthermore, Syed Jafar officially informed the second defendant and the Registrar on 18 November 1994 that he would immediately take action to expunge the second defendant from the land register but no action was taken thereafter. Syed Jafar should have expected a follow-up inquiry from the Registrar, as the Registrar had previously informed him to update the land registry on the outcome of the impending action due to the outstanding caveat lodged with the registry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 To persuade the court to accept Syed Jafar’s explanation in his affidavit, the plaintiffs referred the court to <span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee and others v Seow Boon Cheng and another </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 604 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee</span>”)

The reasons for this, as Stuart-Smith LJ pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Lonrho plc v Fayed (No 3)</span> The Times (24 June 1993), are plain. Affidavits raised in such circumstances do not address the issues for trial and whether the deponent is truthful or not in respect of the discovery of documents he might still persuade the trial judge of the merits of his case through other evidence. … It should be noted that Mr Khoo [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiffs’ counsel] had accepted from the outset that he was not seeking a cross-examination of the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Choo JC said that the contents of the affidavit could generally be accepted before the trial. He did not say that this rule would apply in every case, whether the affidavit is filed for a pre-trial matter or as evidence to be tested at trial. There are differences between <span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee</span> and this case. The reason why the affidavits in <span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee</span> could be taken at its face value was because they were filed for pre-trial matters and were not subject to cross-examination. In this case, whether Syed Jafar had received the Registrar’s 2001 letter goes directly to the issue of whether he had the knowledge of the Registrar’s 2001 letter. This is not a pre-trial issue and instead has to do with the evidence that will subsequently be adduced at trial to prove the plaintiffs’ claim. Hence, unlike the court in <span class="font-italic">Soh Lup Chee</span>, I could not accept this affidavit at its face value. Syed Jafar’s explanation was self-serving and conveniently shifted the blame to the Registrar for his own failure to update his address in the land registry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second plank of the plaintiffs’ argument was that even if Syed Jafar knew or should have known of the Registrar’s 2001 letter, Syed Jafar’s knowledge should not be imputed to the plaintiffs since the trustees had changed in 1998 and later in 2009. The plaintiffs cited no authority for this proposition. In contrast, the defendants relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Abdul Jalil</span> (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>[24]) for the proposition that subsequent trustees are bound by the acts of previous trustees. In <span class="font-italic">Abdul Jalil</span>, the previous trustees of a trust had entered into lease agreements with the respondent. Eventually the sole trustee that remained claimed rent arrears from the respondent. The sole trustee later waived the rent, and thereafter appointed the appellants as the new trustees. When the appellants discovered the sole trustee’s waiver, they commenced proceedings challenging the sole trustee’s power to do so. One of the issues facing the Court of Appeal was whether the appellants were estopped from claiming the rent due to the sole trustee’s waiver. The appellants argued that they could not be bound by a waiver represented by the previous sole trustee’s solicitors, who were not acting for the appellants. The Court of Appeal dismissed this argument at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, these arguments have no merit. If the waiver was binding on the sole trustee and the trust, it was binding on the appellants who are the successor trustees of the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Court of Appeal could not have been clearer and I adopted this statement of the law. Syed Jafar was not engaging the Registrar in correspondence in his personal capacity but in his capacity as trustee. The plaintiffs brought this claim not in their personal capacities but in their capacities as trustees. Syed Jafar’s acts <span class="font-italic">qua </span>trustee bound the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">qua </span>trustees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, I found that the trustees of the Aljunied Trust (previously Syed Jafar, but now the plaintiffs) knew about the second defendant’s claim to the Property and about the purported fraud because Syed Jafar threatened to commence proceedings in 1994. Hence, even if the plaintiffs’ case on fraud were made out, the limitation period would have started to run from 1994. More than 12 years have passed since then and the claim was time-barred. Hence, I found that even if the plaintiffs were able to prove all the facts that they alleged – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the facts pertaining to the alleged fraud – their case would still be <span class="font-italic">legally unsustainable</span> as it fell afoul of the Limitation Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, the plaintiffs had made an oblique reference to the possibility of the conveyances being obtained by mistake in their written submissions, although the plaintiffs’ counsel said that this was “not the main thrust” of their arguments at the hearing before me.

</div>
</div> I will address this briefly for completeness. Under s 29 of the Limitation Act, if there was a mistake in a conveyances, time also does not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered or could have with reasonable diligence discovered the mistake. However, the plaintiffs adduced no evidence to suggest that the conveyances to the defendants were as a result of any mistake. In any event, the plaintiffs would also have discovered any mistake in the title by 1994, when the then-trustee lodged the caveat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Accordingly, I affirmed AR’s decision and struck out the plaintiffs’ claim on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defence of laches applied</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even if the plaintiffs’ claim were not time-barred under the Limitation Act, the claim would still have failed due to the defence of laches.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Before I answer the question of whether the defence of laches applied, a preliminary point that neither the AR nor the parties addressed in detail is whether the Limitation Act’s presence precludes the defence of laches from applying. On the one hand, s 32 of the Limitation Act appears to provide that the defence of laches can still apply. Section 32 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Acquiescence </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">32. </span>Nothing in this Act shall affect any equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of acquiescence, laches or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, a more qualified position appears to have been taken in <span class="font-italic">UAM v UAN and another</span> [2017] SGHCF 10 (“<span class="font-italic">UAM</span>”).

</div> In that case, Valerie Thean JC considered the question of whether the defence of laches could apply to probate proceedings in which a son was asking the court to affirm a will made in 1981 by his mother and declare invalid a contrary will made in 1980. Thean JC, after going through the authorities, noted at [100] that the authorities seemed to suggest that “an <span class="font-italic">equitable</span> defence of laches has no application in a case where a <span class="font-italic">legal</span> remedy was sought to enforce a <span class="font-italic">legal</span> right, and where a statutory limitation period applied” [emphasis in original]. However, Thean JC also eventually noted that the Court of Appeal in previous cases had “<span class="font-italic">declined to express any conclusive view</span> <span class="font-italic">on whether the doctrine of laches is applicable to a common [law] claim</span> … and left this issue to a future court for determination” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I am of the view that the defence of laches could operate in this case. Section 32 of the Limitation Act suggests that whether the defence of laches could apply does not turn solely on whether a statutory limitation applies. Otherwise, s 32 would be otiose. Rather, as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">eSys Technologies Pte Ltd v nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 1200 at [37]–[38] (which Thean JC cited in <span class="font-italic">UAM</span> at [100]), there is an additional question of whether the plaintiffs were asserting a common law claim or an equitable claim. In the present case, however, neither party disputed that the defence of laches could be applicable. I shall therefore proceed on the basis that it applies and shall now explain how I found that the defence of laches applied even if the claim was not time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In relation to the defence of laches, the applicable legal principles were not in dispute and have been recently summarised succinctly by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>”) at [44], which referred to a long string of previous local jurisprudence to this effect:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Laches is a doctrine of equity. It is properly invoked where essentially there has been a substantial lapse of time coupled with circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or, where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted … This is a broad-based inquiry and it would be relevant to consider the length of delay before the claim was brought, the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant, as well as any element of unconscionability in allowing the claim to be enforced …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>, the parties initially shared a close relationship but later fell out. While they were still working closely together, the parties bought some shares but these shares were held solely by the appellant. When the parties fell out, the respondent commenced proceedings seeking an account of the shares and the sale proceeds from them. The Court of Appeal found that the doctrine of laches applied and barred the respondent’s claim. The court noted that the delay was some ten to 13 years (depending on which party’s case was to be taken) and this delay occurred after the parties had essentially come to a stalemate. In correspondence during the period of delay, the respondent merely restated his allegations without attempting to provide further evidence. After the correspondence, the respondent did not commence legal proceedings. The court found that the long silence made it “reasonable for [the appellant] to believe that the matter [was] over” (at [51]). This was even more significant considering that the claim would primarily have to be based on the parties’ recollections, since this was an internal share purchase during a period when the parties shared a close relationship, worked on the basis of trust, and therefore limited their formal documentation. The loss of evidence, primarily in the form of the appellant’s ability to recall events,  amplified the prejudice of the delay in commencing proceedings (at [54] and [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 With this in mind, I turn now to the present case. Essentially, I had to decide whether the plaintiffs’ conduct coupled with the extensive lapse of time prejudiced the defendants to such an extent that it would be unfair to ask the defendants to defend against the claim now.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I first ascertained when the delay began.

</div>
</div>
</div> the Court of Appeal noted at [126] that it is “important to ascertain when the Appellants realised the true manner in which the Property was being held because that is the reference point from which any delay on their part in bringing their claim against [the respondent] must be assessed”. In this case, the relevant time when the plaintiffs became aware of the true state of affairs, in the light of the correspondence between the trustees of the Aljunied Trust and the Registrar, was 1994. The proceedings were brought in 2017, which is a delay of 23 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Having ascertained the delay in this case, I considered whether the delay occasioned any prejudice to the defendants. The defendants relied on <span class="font-italic">UAM</span> for the proposition that the plaintiffs’ inaction in commencing the proceedings prejudiced their ability to give evidence. This was especially prejudicial for witnesses relying on their personal knowledge of the relevant events. In <span class="font-italic">UAM</span>, Thean JC found that if the defence was available it would have been made out on the facts, for the following reasons (at [104]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I am satisfied that it would be unconscionable to allow the plaintiff to pursue his claim based on the length of the delay and of the plaintiff’s inaction in pronouncing the 1981 Will that he had since the demise of the mother in 1986. Nothing precluded him from doing so and he has not put forth any satisfactory explanation. Contrary to his assertions, his ability to prove the 1981 Will is in no way contingent upon knowledge of the 1980 Will. … [T]he delay here greatly prejudices the defendants in their ability to defend the claim because it has deprived the defendants of direct evidence of the witnesses with personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1981 Will. The solicitors who prepared and witnessed the execution of the 1981 Will have no recollection of the events at the material time, and the physical file opened for the 1981 Will is also no longer in their possession. With regard to the contentions regarding the validity of the 1980 Will, the passing of the brother also prejudices the defendants. Material evidence is no longer available with the passing of almost three decades since the mother’s death and a decade since the brother’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I agreed with the defendants that similar considerations were present in this case. The trustees of the Aljunied Trust, albeit not the plaintiffs personally, had the information necessary to commence the present proceedings since 1994. In fact, the then-trustee, Syed Jafar, had indicated to all the parties involved that he wanted to begin proceedings. The Registrar and the second defendant were notified about this intention. So when Syed Jafar took no action not only in 1994 after a series of correspondence but again in 1997 after another exchange of letters, it was reasonable for the second defendant to believe that the trustees of the Aljunied Trust were no longer interested in pursuing the claim. This was similar to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng </span><span class="font-italic">Wah</span>. This position was later confirmed by the fact that the trustees allowed its caveat and the Registrar’s caveat to lapse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further, similar to the situation in <span class="font-italic">UAM</span>, no cogent explanation was offered to explain the delay. The plaintiffs said that it was only in 2010 when they started the conversion of their properties (including properties unrelated to the present claim) to the Torrens system. It was only when they received a reply from the SLA in 2012 that they realised that there was an issue with the Property. I could not accept this explanation as the plaintiffs were bound by the knowledge of the previous trustee, Syed Jafar. It cannot be that every time a trust appoints a new trustee or replaces the previous trustees that the time – whether for limitation periods or for delays – starts to run again because the new trustees need to be re-apprised of the situation. Rather, the responsibility lies with the office of the trustee and whoever has been appointed to properly take over the knowledge and documents of the previous trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The unexplained delay by the plaintiffs caused significant prejudice to the defendants. Like <span class="font-italic">UAM</span> where the witnesses with direct evidence of the events have been deprived of their personal recollection, the witnesses here were clearly prejudiced in terms of their ability to recall what happened regarding the conveyances which the plaintiffs claimed were tainted by fraud. And similar to <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>, the prejudice in this case was amplified because the claim was based primarily on the parties’ recollection. Since the cause of action is fraud, the oral evidence of the parties who were present at the conveyances is of particular importance in allowing the court to ascertain their state of mind. The same applied to the defendants’ evidence, which the plaintiffs would have needed to test in order to establish their claim that the defendants could have checked the Property for prior encumbrances at the time of the 1977 conveyance, but did not. These were issues which the documents did not reveal and which required oral evidence. Accordingly, I was satisfied that applying the doctrine of laches, the plaintiffs’ own unexplained delay resulted in a loss of the defendants’ evidence, prejudicing their ability to conduct their defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Hence, I also found that the plaintiffs’ contentions in relation to the defence of laches were also legally unsustainable and I therefore struck out the plaintiffs’ claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether fraud under s 46(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) of the LTA is present to displace the first defendant’s indefeasible title</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Even if the plaintiffs’ claim was not time-barred or barred by the defence of laches, I would have found that there was no reasonable cause of action disclosed as regards the claim to defeat the first defendant’s title on account of fraud under s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The starting point is s 46 of the LTA. Although the plaintiffs relied only on the fraud exception in s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), it will first be useful to set out some of the other provisions which set s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in its proper context:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Estate of proprietor paramount</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">46.</span>—(1) Notwithstanding —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the existence in any other person of any estate or interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land, whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens, estates and interests except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register, but subject to …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Nothing in this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies of any person —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to have the registered title of a proprietor defeated on the ground of fraud or forgery to which that proprietor or his agent was a party or in which he or his agent colluded;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Nothing in this section shall confer on a proprietor claiming otherwise than as a purchaser any better title than was held by his immediate predecessor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Although the plaintiffs relied on s 160 of the LTA to seek rectification of the land register, s 160 does not provide any additional grounds other than what is already found within s 46(2).

</div> as follows. The first defendant, as the party claiming that he owns the Property, must establish his legal title to it. But in doing so he is entitled to rely on the presumption of indefeasibility afforded to a registered owner of a property under the LTA. All he needs to show, therefore, is that he is the registered owner of the Property. The plaintiffs will then bear the legal burden of establishing one of the limbs under s 46(2) so as to impugn the first defendant’s title.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In this case, the parties did not dispute that the first defendant paid the second defendant for the Property and is the current registered owner.

Second, who does this fraud need to be perpetrated by?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The definition of fraud under s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LTA is neatly encapsulated in the following two passages in <span class="font-italic">Bebe</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [22] and [34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 … the mere failure to make further inquiries could not amount to wilful blindness akin to fraud as there was no dishonesty, moral turpitude, want of probity, or intent on the part of UOB’s solicitors to disregard the respondent’s rights. At worse, as counsel contended, Ms Loo was guilty of negligence or a failure to exercise due diligence. Counsel … [contended] that a mere failure of UOB’s solicitors to be more vigilant and to make further inquiries would not <span class="font-italic">of itself</span> prove fraud on their part unless their suspicions that a fraud was being perpetrated had been aroused and they abstained from doing so for fear of finding out the truth. … We accept counsel’s submission that the evidence showed that the conduct of UOB’s solicitors amounted to no more than negligence or lack of due diligence in finding out the true state of affairs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 The hallmark of fraud is dishonesty or moral turpitude, which usually stems from greed, and greed simply means taking something of value which does not belong to you. ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, there must be either an actual intent to deceive or to be dishonest, or there must be wilful blindness in the sense that the defendants’ suspicions were aroused but they did not take steps to find out more for fear of discovering the truth. Negligence will not suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As to the question of who the fraud must be perpetrated by, the plain words of s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) make clear that the fraud must have been perpetrated by the registered proprietor or his agent. This is again confirmed by <span class="font-italic">Bebe</span>, where the Court of Appeal at [15] cited with approval the following passage from the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Assets Company, Limited v Mere Roihi</span> [1905] AC 176 at 210:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fraud by persons from whom [the registered proprietor] claims does not affect him unless knowledge of it is <span class="font-italic">brought home to him or his agents</span>. The mere fact that he might have found out fraud if he had been more vigilant, and had made further inquiries which he omitted to make, does not of itself prove fraud on his part. But if it be shewn that his suspicions were aroused, and that he abstained from making inquiries for fear of learning the truth, the case is very different, and fraud may be properly ascribed to him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage and the above passages (at [71]) work hand in hand. Because only fraud by the registered proprietor or his agents will suffice to fulfil the requirement under s 46(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), it follows that the mere failure to inquire cannot satisfy the fraud requirement as the dishonesty will not have been “brought home”. Only if the registered proprietor deliberately fails to inquire despite being given a chance to find out the truth can the fraudulent intention properly be inferred against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In the present case, the registered proprietor is the first defendant and therefore the fraud must have been perpetuated by him or his agent. However, the plaintiffs’ statement of claim and submissions disclose that the main fraud that they complained of was that Kavena conveyed the Property a second time in 1895 to the Hindoo Temple Trustees when he knew that he had no title to transfer, because he had already transferred title to the Property to Jayna in 1879. Among other things, the plaintiffs also alleged that the common solicitors to the transactions failed to conduct proper title searches and that the defendants ought to have known that Kavena had conveyed title to the Property to Jayna who in turn conveyed it to Syed Allowei and finally to Syed Ahmat. Hence, the alleged fraud lay in the defendants knowing that they did not have title to the Property but continuing to insist that they did.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I did not accept these submissions. The plaintiffs were alleging that the fraud in this case was in Kavena’s conveyance to the Hindoo Temple Trustees (who in turn conveyed the Property to the second defendant, who then further conveyed it to the first defendant). To begin with, there was no evidence that Kavena’s conveyance were tainted by fraud. Apart from saying that the solicitors to the conveyances were common to both sides, the plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence to show that there was fraud involved when Kavena made the transfer to the Hindoo Temple Trustees in 1895. To the extent that the plaintiffs were saying that the common solicitors failed to conduct title searches, this would not be fraud but merely negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Even if Kavena’s conveyance to the Hindoo Temple Trustees was tainted by fraud, there is absolutely no evidence that the second defendant knew of or participated in this fraud. And although wilful blindness can lead to an inference of fraud, I found that there was no such wilful blindness on the part of the second defendant. The time interval between 1895 (when Kavena conveyed the Property to the Hindoo Temple Trustees) and 1977 (when the Hindoo Temple Trustees conveyed it to the second defendant) was about 82 years. It was very unlikely that a conveyance some 82 years ago would arouse the suspicions of the second defendant when the Property was conveyed to him, especially since the plaintiffs could not show that there was any suggestion of impropriety that had been specifically brought to the second defendant’s attention. To the extent that the plaintiffs said that the second defendant would have discovered Kavena’s fraud by looking into the historical conveyances of the Property, this, again would amount to negligence or lack of due diligence at most, which <span class="font-italic">Bebe</span> has made clear does not amount to fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Given that I have found no fraud on the part of the second defendant, the plaintiffs’ case against the first defendant similarly fails. The first defendant is even further removed from the conveyances than the second defendant and any fraud is simply too far away to tarnish him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The plaintiffs’ entire case seemed to be founded on a misguided understanding of the Torrens system. The plaintiffs’ submissions amounted to saying that because they had an interest in the Property prior to it being brought under the Torrens system, every subsequent registered proprietor of the Property under the LTA must check afresh to see whether the plaintiffs had an interest; otherwise they would have assumed title fraudulently. This would make a mockery of the Torrens system and the indefeasibility of title that it affords.

</div> the Court of Appeal was faced with a similar challenge but from an adverse possessor. The court noted at [44] that interests in land which already subsisted when that land was brought under the Torrens system would have to be protected by lodging a caveat while the land is qualified. Once the land becomes unqualified, then all unprotected interests which are not overriding interests would be overreached. This was to ensure the integrity of the Torrens system. In the present case, the plaintiffs did indeed lodge a caveat but had allowed it to lapse. The first defendant’s title is now indefeasible and the plaintiffs cannot impugn it based on the fact that it may have had an interest in the Property prior to it being brought under the Torrens system.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Hence, even though the threshold for striking out a claim is high, I found that it was met on these facts. The plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud were bare assertions and the evidence did not indicate that there was fraud in the conveyances of the Property to the defendants who were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers. This is especially so in the face of the Torrens system which <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> precludes parties like the plaintiffs from going behind the indefeasibility of title except in very limited circumstances. The plaintiffs’ claim fell far outside these circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In summary, I affirmed the AR’s decision to strike out the plaintiffs’ claim on the following grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The action was clearly time-barred under s 9 (read with s 10) of the Limitation Act as more than 12 years had passed since Kavena’s initial transactions of 1895. Even if there were fraud and s 29 of the Limitation Act applied to postpone the time limitation, it would have started to run from 1994. By then the trustees would have known of the purported fraud as Syed Jafar had lodged a caveat with the Registry and threatened to take action against the second defendant. The action would have been time-barred in 2006.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs’ considerable delay in taking action after the discovery of purported fraud in 1994 prejudiced the defendants who could avail themselves of the defence of laches.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendants, specifically the first defendant, had an indefeasible title under the LTA. The plaintiffs could not show any evidence that there was fraud in the defendants’ conveyances in 1977 and 2000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal. I also ordered the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants the costs of the appeal fixed at $16,000 (inclusive of disbursements).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kirpal Singh s/o Hakam Singh and Oh Hsiu Leem Osborne (Kirpal &amp; Associates) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Tan Hsuan Boon (Wee Swee Teow LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
