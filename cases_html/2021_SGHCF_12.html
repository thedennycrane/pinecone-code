</div>
</div>
</div> There, the Court of Appeal held that there were four possible dates: (a) the date of separation; (b) the date the writ of divorce was filed; (c) the date of interim judgment; and (d) the date of the ancillary matters hearing. The starting point or default position should be the date of interim judgment, unless the particular circumstances of justice of the case warrant it. The justification is that the interim judgment “puts an end to the marriage contract and indicates that the parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets …” (<span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32], citing <span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS </span>[2010] 4 SLR 617 (“<span class="font-italic">AJR</span>”) at [4]). The grant of interim judgment is a recognition by the court that there is “no longer any matrimonial home, no <span class="font-italic">consortium vitae </span>and no right on either side to conjugal rights” (<span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah </span>[1987] SLR(R) 702 at [25]). Applying this date also brings certainty for parties to arrange their financial affairs. Further, where such factors are present, it would be “artificial to speak of any asset acquired <span class="font-italic">after</span> the interim judgment has been granted as being a matrimonial asset” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">ARY</span> <span class="font-italic">v ARX </span>at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As held in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35]–[36], this approach preserves the court’s flexibility to ensure that justice is done in every case. The court may depart from this default position where there are cogent reasons to do so. This includes situations where, for example, a party incurs a large amount of expenditure from having “indulged in certain vices” such that the matrimonial assets have been “unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable actions of that party” (<span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">AJR </span>at [6]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Adopting a starting point in respect of the operative date ensures that the inquiry as a whole is systematic. This is because as observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> at [36], the court has discretion at multiple levels, not just in selecting the date of determining the pool of matrimonial assets, but also in selecting the date of valuation of such assets and how those assets should be divided. The court also has the discretion to exclude specific property from the pool of matrimonial assets. This can be seen in <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat</span>”), which was cited by counsel for the Wife. There, the Court of Appeal excluded an apartment acquired by the husband in his sole name <span class="font-italic">during </span>the marriage from the pool of matrimonial assets, such that the wife would have “no share in its profits”, as she had claimed that “she has nothing to do with the liabilities associated with [the property]” (at [23]). Prakash JA (as she then was), in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal, held at [25]–[26] that while it may be that a property was acquired during the marriage, and therefore technically falls under the definition of a matrimonial asset contained in s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter, the court’s power to divide any matrimonial asset is a discretionary power. This is obvious from ss 112(1) and 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. It is thus not mandatory for the court to exercise its powers of division under s 112 of the Women’s Charter and the court may generally decline to do so where a valid reason is given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Wife’s concerns on the Husband’s lack of contributions to Property 2 and the unfairness of him having a share in it, are therefore not directly relevant to the issue that was brought before me, which is the determination of the operative date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife’s concerns about Property 2 are more properly dealt with at the later stage of division of matrimonial assets, where consideration can be made on whether a specific property is to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets, taking into account factors such as the relative contributions of parties to that specific property. <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat</span> is illustrative of such an assessment at the later stage of division of matrimonial assets, and is hence not directly relevant to the inquiry here on the operative date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 For the determination of the operative date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets, however, the crux of assessment is when the marriage can be treated as “practically at an end”: <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX </span>at [34], citing Debbie Ong, “Family Law” (2011) 12 SAL Ann Rev 298 at para 15.23. On this, counsel for both parties agreed that the three indicia of <span class="font-italic">ARY </span><span class="font-italic">v ARX –</span> that there is no longer any matrimonial home, no <span class="font-italic">consortium </span><span class="font-italic">vitae </span>and no right on either side to conjugal rights – are relevant to such an assessment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First date – 31 December 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Taking into consideration the three indicia of <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span>, I found no basis for holding that the operative date is the first date proposed by the Wife, that is 31 December 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It was disputed by the Husband that there was no matrimonial home after 31 December 2016. The evidence bears him out. There was still a matrimonial home after 31 December 2016:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband and Wife were still staying at the matrimonial home at Property 1 after 31 December 2016, up to 7 May 2017, when the Wife moved into Property 2.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife admitted that she and the Husband had discussed in February 2017, about the Husband moving into Property 2.

She informed the husband in April 2014 that she and their daughter would not be returning to Singapore. The Court of Appeal excluded from the pool of assets a landed property in China acquired by the wife in December 2014, several months after she had left Singapore for China.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The other set of cases relied on by the Wife, <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kien Keong v Khoo Hong Eng</span> [2014] 1 SLR 1342 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kien Keong</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ </span>[2016] 4 SLR 674 (“<span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span>”), also do not assist her as they are also based on  crucially different set of facts. In both cases there was an actual deed of separation that was signed by both parties, which was relied on by the court to fix the operative date as the date of the deed of separation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kien Keong, </span>the court observed at [13] that where parties have agreed to comprehensively and conclusively organise their financial arrangements after or in contemplation of their separation, there would be no good reason why such an agreement should not be given full weight. The circumstances in which the deed was made was also crucial. The deed was signed after the wife had moved out of the matrimonial home to live in another apartment. The court thus cited as useful the observations made in <span class="font-italic">Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 902, that where the deed in question was made at a time when the parties had already been separated, and divorce was viewed as a real possibility, the onus is on the husband to justify why the court should disregard parties’ express intentions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span>, the court examined the deed in question and found at [26] that it was clear that the parties’ marital relationship came to an end with the conclusion of the deed and the parties recognised it as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In contrast, there was no signed deed of separation here. There was no conclusive agreement which clearly showed that the parties’ marital relationship had come to an end or that the parties had recognised any agreement as such. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Wife prepared the Deed and sent it to the Husband. He counter-proposed to the Wife with an amended Deed that included a stipulation that the Wife was not entitled to claim any maintenance from the Husband, and that on that basis, he would agree to sign the Deed. It is clear, from such exchange, that both parties did not agree on the terms and did not sign the Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Wife sought to rely alternatively on a verbal agreement between the parties even though the Deed was not signed. But even the Wife’s reply to the Husband’s counterproposal, set out at [9(b)] above, is equivocal. Moreover, as pointed out by the Husband, one of the terms that the Husband wanted was that the Wife would not claim maintenance, but she was now claiming for maintenance. This showed that there was no agreement between them. In light of where this was left hanging, it could not be said that there is evidence of a verbal agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In any case, the circumstances following the Husband and Wife’s discussion about the Deed did not show that the parties’ relationship had clearly come to an end. There were affectionate messages exchanged between the Husband and Wife in February and March 2017. There were exchanges of love between Husband and Wife in the messages of 10 February 2017,

</div> The Wife submitted that while there were some exchange of messages which were cordial and showed some affection at times after 31 December 2016, this was against the background that parties had already agreed to divorce and that these messages had to be considered against the context of other more terse and accusatory messages. However, the fact that both Husband and Wife were still at times loving and affectionate with each other in their messages, as of February and March 2017, while they were still residing together in the matrimonial home, renders it difficult to conclude that the marital relationship had come to an end by then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 During oral submissions, counsel for the Wife also relied on <span class="font-italic">ARY v </span><span class="font-italic">ARX</span> to submit that there was unreasonable or unfair depletion of matrimonial assets, as the Husband continued staying at Property 1 from January 2017 to October 2020, paying a monthly rental of $16,000 amounting to a total sum of $736,000, when he did not have any income during this period. While the court did recognise in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX </span>at [35] that a large amount of expenditure by a party to “indulg(e) in certain vices” could provide cogent reasons to depart from the usual starting point, it cannot be said that the expenditure of moneys by the Husband on the rent of Property 1 while the whole family was living there (up to May 2017) is an indulgence in a vice, or an unfair or unjust depletion of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Counsel for the Wife further submitted that the Husband had disowned his interest in Property 2 and thus there was no intention to jointly accumulate assets. It may be the case that the Husband did not want to share in the purchase of Property 2. However, the crux of the inquiry before me is whether the marriage had practically come to an end, taking into consideration the three indicia in <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> <span class="font-italic">v ARX</span>. The Husband’s lack of intention to contribute to the purchase of Property 2, on its own, bearing in mind that there were other household expenses such as the rental of Property 1, does not clearly indicate that parties lacked the intention to jointly accumulate assets. Neither does it show that parties intended to have a clean break such that the marriage had come to an end.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second date – 6 March 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I also found no basis for holding that the operative date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets to be 6 March 2017, which was the Wife’s second date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This was the date around which the parties were alleged to have taken off their wedding rings. Whether such actions demonstrate that the marriage has practically come to an end must necessarily be contextual, taking into account the nature of the relationship at that point of time. In any event, it is the Husband’s evidence that he did not remove his wedding ring from March 2017.

</div> He removed it for one night in March but put it back the following day. He finally removed it in April 2017 following a confrontation with the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Wife also submitted that March 2017 should be the operative date as it was during this period that the Husband and Wife made arrangements to physically live separately from each other.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, it is not clear on the evidence, taken together as a whole, that the three indicia of <span class="font-italic">ARY</span> <span class="font-italic">v ARX </span>were satisfied and that the marriage had practically come to an end by 6 March 2017: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It is undisputed that both Husband and Wife continued to live with each other during March 2017, until the Wife moved out on 7 May 2017.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There were discussions of Husband and Wife living together in Property 2 after they move out of the matrimonial home, as late as February 2017: see [25] above. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There were also affectionate messages that continued to be exchanged between the Husband and Wife, on 10 February 2017, 1 March 2017, and 7–8 March 2017 (which is after the second proposed date of 6 March 2017): see [31] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Thus, on the evidence, there was no <span class="font-italic">clear</span> indication that the marriage had practically come to an end as of 6 March 2017. Neither did the authorities relied on by the Wife support the view that their making plans to live separately (as compared to <span class="font-italic">actually</span> living separately) sufficed in meeting the criteria in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> that there is no longer a matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">AUA</span><span class="font-italic"> v ATZ</span>, a deed of separation was entered into between the parties. The Court of Appeal found at [26] that the parties’ marital relationship came to a close with the conclusion of the deed of separation and that the parties also recognised it as such. There was no longer a matrimonial home, as the wife was to move out of the matrimonial home as per the deed of separation signed by parties. Both would stay in separate apartments from then on. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Kien Keong</span>, the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home on 12 March 2003 and a deed of separation was signed on 28 March 2003. The court found at [101] that the date of the signing of the deed of separation was the operative date for determining what fell within the pool of matrimonial assets. There was clearly no matrimonial home at that point in time, as the wife had moved out of the matrimonial home to live in a different apartment, before the signing of the deed of separation. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third date – 7 May 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I found that by the third date proposed by the Wife, 7 May 2017, it was clear that there was no matrimonial home. That was the date that the Wife and Child moved out of Property 1 into Property 2. Counsel for the Husband also acknowledged that there was no matrimonial home then and that on that basis, the three indicia of <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX </span>were fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In addition, the evidence is that from that date, the Husband and Wife were living separately. The Husband and Wife did not spend time together as a family with the Child but did so on their own, and the Husband and Wife no longer intended to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets. I accept that them taking care of the Child thereafter was done <span class="font-italic">qua</span> mother or father, instead of being qua spouse: <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> at [27]. I therefore departed from the default position of the date of interim judgment and held that the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets would be their date of separation, that is 7 May 2017, when the Wife moved out of their matrimonial home (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Property 1).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In conclusion, it is clear on the evidence that it was only by 7 May 2017 that there was no longer a matrimonial home for the Husband and Wife, as that was when the Wife moved out of Property 1 to Property 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I awarded costs to the Wife at $4,000 inclusive of disbursements.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sim Bock Eng, Chan Yu Xin (WongPartnership LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sudhershen Hariram (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
