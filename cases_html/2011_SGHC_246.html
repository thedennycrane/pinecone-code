<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The facts of this case are actually fairly
                    straightforward: the plaintiff licensor is suing the defendant licensee for
                    arrears of royalty payments. However, the matter has been complicated by the
                    defendant’s counterclaims. OMG Holdings Pte Ltd (“the
                    Plaintiff”) is a company incorporated in Singapore that provides in-store
                    advertising programs and products. It was formerly known as ActMedia Asia Pte
                    Ltd. Pos Ad Sdn Bhd (“the Defendant”) is a company
                    incorporated in Malaysia which provides advertising media services to various
                    brand owners for the marketing of their products in supermarkets across
                    Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 30 June 1993, the Plaintiff entered into
                    a master licence agreement (“the Master Licence Agreement”) with a
                    Canadian company known as ActMedia Canada Inc (“ActMedia Canada”)
                    which developed products and programs for the in-store advertising of consumer
                    goods in supermarkets. Under the Master Licence Agreement, ActMedia Canada
                    licensed to the Plaintiff the exclusive right to use the ActMedia system
                    (“the Licensed System”) within the countries of Singapore,
                    Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong. In return, the
                    Plaintiff paid ActMedia Canada a royalty fee every quarter. The Plaintiff then
                    sub-licensed these rights to the Defendant pursuant to a sub-licence agreement
                    dated 1 July 1993 (“the 1993 Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2000, the Plaintiff and the Defendant signed
                    a Surrender of Licence Agreement (“the Surrender Agreement”)
                    agreeing that the sub-licence should be surrendered absolutely effective from
                    22 April 1999 due to the termination of the Master Licence Agreement
                    between the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada. The 1993 Agreement was thus
                    surrendered and subsequently replaced with another agreement dated 1 July
                    2002 whereby the Plaintiff licensed to the Defendant certain in-store
                    advertising products and programmes (“the 2002 Agreement”). The
                    2002 Agreement expired and was subsequently replaced with an agreement dated
                    1 July 2004 (“the 2004 Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff is suing the Defendant for arrears
                    of outstanding royalty payments under the 2004 Agreement for the period December
                    2007 to December 2008, <em>viz</em>, RM967,753.45 (as at
                    31 December 2008). It is not disputed that the Defendant has not paid this
                    sum to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also claims that after the termination of
                    the 2004 Agreement on 30 October 2007, the Defendant continues to use the
                    products or copies of the products in breach of cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement.
                    Accordingly, the Plaintiff claims for an account of all revenue received and
                    profit generated from the continued use of the products, and seeks an injunction
                    to restrain the Defendant’s use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Defendant claims that there were
                    misrepresentations in relation to all three agreements. Critically, the
                    Defendant argues that the Plaintiff had represented that the latter had
                    exclusive rights licensed to it by ActMedia Canada, and failed to inform the
                    Defendant that the Master Licence Agreement contained a cl 1.3 which stated that
                    the licensee had no right to sub-licence the Licensed System. Additionally, the
                    Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to inform the Defendant that the
                    Master Licence Agreement had been terminated on 22 April
                1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Defendant challenges the authenticity of the
                    Surrender Agreement and claims that it was imprecise and erroneously prepared.
                    It also alleges that the termination of the 2004 Agreement was wrongful. As
                    such, the Defendant contends that the royalties it paid from 1993 to 2007 should
                    be returned in light of the Plaintiff’s misrepresentations. Additionally,
                    the Defendant seeks an order that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement, which obliges
                    the Defendant to refrain from making use of the Licensed System and anything
                    similar to the Licensed System upon the termination of the 2004 Agreement,
                    amounts to an unreasonable restraint of trade and is therefore
                invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Plaintiff made fraudulent misrepresentations to the
                Defendant in relation to the 1993 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is trite law that to prove fraudulent
                    misrepresentation the elements set out below must be satisfied: <em>Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R)
                    435 at [14] (following <em>Bradford Building Society v
                        Borders</em> [1941] 2 All ER 205):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or
                        conduct. Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it
                        should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which
                        includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had
                        acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff
                        suffered damage by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with
                        knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in
                        the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Here, the Plaintiff’s representation to
                    the Defendant that it had obtained exclusive rights to this region from ActMedia
                    Canada was not false as the Plaintiff was indeed the latter’s exclusive
                    licensee in this region. Even if the Plaintiff breached the terms of its Master
                    Licence Agreement with ActMedia Canada by sub-licensing the Licensed System,
                    this was principally a matter between the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada that did
                    not concern the Defendant so long as ActMedia Canada did not seek recourse
                    against the Defendant. Additionally, as ActMedia Canada knew full well that the
                    Plaintiff was sub-licensing the product, it effectively waived the restriction.
                    In the correspondence between the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada, the parties
                    freely discussed the sub-licence to the Defendant: indeed, the Plaintiff sent
                    ActMedia Canada a spreadsheet detailing the payments of royalties from the
                    Defendant in a telefax dated 16 December 1996. During this period, it was
                    thus clear that ActMedia Canada expressly acknowledged the Defendant as a
                    sub-licensee of the Plaintiff and as an associate of the ActMedia group: in
                    fact, in an ActMedia contact list entitled “ActMedia–International
                    Associates” dated 21 February 1996, the Defendant’s name and
                    address was listed as the ActMedia–International Associate in Malaysia.
                    Furthermore, ActMedia Canada eventually entered into the 1997 Agreement with the
                    Plaintiff to rationalise the sub-licensing and retroactively give express
                    consent to it, albeit with conditions attached. It follows that it does not lie
                    in the Defendant’s mouth to object to the Plaintiff’s breach of the
                    terms of the Master Licence Agreement when ActMedia Canada neither objected to
                    it nor brought any claim against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Even if we took the Defendant’s case on
                    misrepresentation at its highest, the Defendant failed to prove that it suffered
                    any loss; on the contrary, it reaped substantial profits from the 1993
                    Agreement. The Defendant’s managing director, Chew Keng Yong
                    (“Chew”), clearly stated in his affidavit that the Licensed
                    System, <em>viz</em>, “Shelf Vision” and
                    “Shelf Banner”, contributed to 60% of the Defendant’s
                    profits. He further admitted under cross-examination that during the period when
                    the Defendant was the Plaintiff’s licensee, the Defendant earned revenue
                    of close to RM130 million from the sale of the licensed products. In view of the
                    Defendant’s inability to prove that it suffered loss as a result of
                    relying on the alleged misrepresentations, its claim for fraudulent
                    misrepresentation must fail. Indeed, I find that the Defendant utilised the
                    Plaintiff’s products and systems and reaped handsome profits, but is now
                    simply seeking to take back the royalties it previously paid after having
                    enjoyed the benefits of the Licensed System.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Plaintiff made misrepresentations to the Defendant in
                relation to the 2002 Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Defendant claims that it was relying on
                    the Plaintiff’s representation that the latter was the exclusive licensee
                    of ActMedia Canada when the Defendant entered into the 2002 Agreement. The
                    Defendant also claims that it did not know that the Master Licence Agreement had
                    been terminated as the Plaintiff failed to inform the Defendant that the Master
                    Licence Agreement had been terminated on 22 April 1999. However, I find the
                    evidence of Chew to be contradictory and inconsistent with the Defendant’s
                    pleaded case. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Chew stated that he had no
                    idea that the Master Licence Agreement between ActMedia Canada and the Plaintiff
                    had been terminated, such that the discovery of the termination in 2009 at a
                    meeting with one Steve Lutz (“Lutz”), a former senior employee of
                    the Plaintiff, came as a complete shock to him. He then further stated that the
                    Plaintiff had deliberately and fraudulently concealed the termination from the
                    Defendant, and confirmed this on the first day of cross-examination. However,
                    when he was cross-examined on a different point during the second day of
                    cross-examination, Chew admitted that actually he already knew about the
                    termination in 2009, even before the meeting with Lutz but had
                    “forgotten” about it. Counsel for the Plaintiff then confirmed
                    with him: “So you knew about the termination, but you forgot?” and
                    Chew replied, “Yes”. This inconsistency undermined the
                    Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had concealed the termination from the
                    former.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Indeed, the parties had signed the Surrender
                    Agreement agreeing that the sub-licence should be surrendered absolutely
                    effective from 22 April 1999 due to the termination of the Master Licence
                    Agreement between the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada. This document was executed
                    by Chew and witnessed by one Loh Ai Pheng, Chew’s personal assistant. The
                    document clearly bears Chew’s signature and I find his claim in his
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (that he did not understand the contents of
                    the document but simply signed on the second page) difficult to believe.
                    Moreover, in the very next sentence in the same affidavit, he contradicted
                    himself by asserting that “[he could not] recall [the]
                    document”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Chew’s attempt to rely on the defence of
                        <em>non est factum</em> was doomed to fail. As pointed
                    out in Beatson et al, <em>Anson’s Law of
                        Contract</em> (Oxford University Press, 29th Ed, 2010) at p
                    259:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must be emphasized that the defence of <em>non est factum</em> is a narrow one. Those too lazy or too busy
                        to read through a document before signing it cannot rely upon it. Nor can
                        those who sign a document containing objectionable terms or terms the legal
                        effect of which they are unaware. As Donovan LJ explained in <em>Muskham Finance Ltd v Howard</em> [[1963] 1 QB 904 at
                        912]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘Much confusion and uncertainty would result in the field of
                            contract and elsewhere if a man were permitted to try to disown his
                            signature simply by asserting that he did not understand that which he
                            had signed.’</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, Chew cannot raise the defence of <em>non est factum</em> simply by asserting that he did not
                    understand what he was signing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Chew’s inconsistent evidence also
                    severely undermined his credibility as a witness. In my view, he sought to
                    disavow the Surrender Agreement realising that it would be fatal to his case
                    that he was unaware of the termination of the Master Licence
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Therefore, I find untenable Chew’s
                    allegation that the Surrender Agreement is inauthentic. The Surrender Agreement
                    clearly referred to the Plaintiff and the Defendant, and unequivocally stated
                    that the “Head Licence Agreement” (<em>ie</em>, the Master Licence Agreement) had been terminated and that
                    neither party would have any claim against the other as a result of the
                    surrender. Although the date of the 1993 Agreement was mistakenly stated as
                    “20 July 1993” instead of “1 July 1993”,
                    it cannot be disputed that at that time the only sub-licence agreement between
                    the parties was the 1993 Agreement. I find that this was an innocent
                    mistake, especially in light of the fact that the recital of the Surrender
                    Agreement correctly stated that the sub-licence agreement commenced from
                    1 July 1993. Although the Surrender Agreement was not dated, it is not
                    disputed that it was faxed out from the Defendant’s office on 28 June
                    2000. It is thus reasonable to assume that Chew executed the Surrender Agreement
                    on that date and arranged for it to be faxed out from his office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I also find that in 2002, when the Plaintiff
                    entered into a fresh agreement with the Defendant, the Plaintiff did not recite
                    or in any way suggest or imply that it was the licensee of ActMedia Canada. It
                    follows that the 2002 Agreement must be viewed as an entirely fresh agreement
                    between the parties, unconnected with the Licensed System under the Master
                    Licence Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Time-bar and entire agreement clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In light of the decision I have reached that
                    there was no actionable misrepresentation on the Plaintiff’s part, it is
                    unnecessary to deal with the Plaintiff’s defences to the Defendant’s
                    counterclaim based on time-bar and the entire agreement clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the 2004 Agreement was wrongfully terminated</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First alleged wrongful termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 30 October 2007, the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors, Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP (“Shook Lin”) sent the
                    Defendant a termination notice (“First Termination Notice”)
                    stating that due to the Defendant’s breach of the confidentiality
                    undertaking in cl 11 of the 2004 Agreement, the Plaintiff was exercising its
                    right to terminate the 2004 Agreement. The Plaintiff alleged that Chew had
                    contracted to sell his majority interest in the holding company of the licensee
                    to a third party, and had allowed a due diligence exercise which would have
                    revealed confidential information of the Plaintiff in breach of the terms of the
                    2004 Agreement. The Defendant responded by denying the Plaintiff’s
                    allegations that a due diligence exercise had been conducted and asserting that
                    the purported termination was wrongful. In Chew’s first affidavit, he
                    referred to the discussions with the third party as “informal
                    talks” which were “never formalised in the form of an official
                    offer”. However, Chew did a <em>volte face</em>
                    after being confronted with conflicting evidence in the Plaintiff’s
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff’s chief marketing officer,
                    Ng Keng Ming (“Ng”), who handled the day-to-day running of the
                    Plaintiff’s in-store advertising business, deposed in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief that Chew had told him over the phone that due diligence had
                    been completed and a sale and purchase agreement was to be executed soon, and
                    that he (Ng) had prepared a contemporaneous note detailing the contents of the
                    conversation. Faced with this evidence, Chew shifted his position and admitted
                    in his subsequent affidavit that due diligence had been completed. He affirmed
                    this again under cross-examination during the course of the trial. Again,
                    Chew’s inconsistent evidence eroded his credibility as a witness. I find
                    that he initially denied that a due diligence exercise had been conducted as he
                    sought make good his contention that the Plaintiff had terminated the contract
                    without any grounds whatsoever, based merely on speculation about Chew’s
                    possible sale of a majority interest to a third party. As such, I find that the
                    Defendant failed to prove that the Plaintiff’s termination of the contract
                    was wrongful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In any event, subsequent to the issuance of
                    the First Termination Notice, the Plaintiff and the Defendant entered into
                    negotiations to attempt to resolve the dispute between them. During this period,
                    the parties still treated the agreement as alive and continuing, and the
                    Defendant continued to use the Licensed System. After a meeting at which Chew
                    requested that the Plaintiff withdraw the First Termination Notice, the
                    Plaintiff agreed to withdraw it by way of a letter from the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors to the Defendant’s solicitors. The letter of 25 June 2008
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... subsequent to the Termination Notice ... our respective clients had
                        proceeded on the basis that the Media Agreement was alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client hereby withdraws the Termination Notice with immediate
                        effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second alleged wrongful termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In July 2008, in compliance with its
                    contractual obligations under the 2004 Agreement, the Defendant submitted to the
                    Plaintiff written reports relating to the gross revenues generated by the
                    Defendant from the licensed operations for the months of December 2007 to May
                    2008. Pursuant to those reports, the Defendant admitted that the sum of
                    RM877,216.45 was payable to the Plaintiff as royalties for the stipulated
                    period. On 16 July 2008, the Plaintiff, through their solicitors Shook Lin,
                    wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors, Wong &amp; Leow LLC (“Wong
                    &amp; Leow”), demanding payment within 14 days. No payment was received
                    within the 14-day period. On 1 August 2008, Shook Lin wrote to Wong &amp;
                    Leow giving the requisite 30-day notice under cl 9.1 of the 2004 Agreement
                    (“the Second Termination Notice”), which states thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The Licensor and Licensee shall each have the right to terminate this
                        Agreement upon notice in writing to the other party if such party defaults
                        in the performance of any of the provisions made hereunder and, in the case
                        of a default which can be remedied, such other party shall not have either
                        (i) remedied such default to the satisfaction of the party not in
                        default within 30 days after written demand by such party ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Defendant failed to make payment by the expiry of the 30-day
                    period. Therefore, on 3 March 2009, Shook Lin wrote to the
                    Defendant’s then solicitors, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“Rajah &amp;
                    Tann”), terminating the 2004 Agreement on the grounds that the Second
                    Termination Notice was not complied with within 30 days of the date of the
                    demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendant contends that the termination
                    was wrongful and is seeking damages. It submits that on 22 January 2009 it
                    had paid the sum of RM967,753.46 to the Plaintiff, pursuant to a written e-mail
                    agreement between Chew and the Plaintiff on 21 January 2009 that the
                    Defendant would pay 50% of the royalties accrued from December 2007 to December
                    2008, with the balance to be paid at a later time to be agreed on. The Defendant
                    asserts that the Plaintiff was not entitled to terminate the agreement on
                    3 March 2009 as the Plaintiff had waived its right to terminate by its
                    conduct in making this agreement. However, a closer scrutiny of the e-mail
                    agreement reveals that the third clause in the agreement stipulated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agreed to work towards the signing of the new addendums [<em>sic</em>] by end Feb 2009 (27/2/2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Meanwhile and until the new addendums [<em>sic</em>]
                        have been entered into, on behalf of OMG, all rights under the license
                        agreements are reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A further letter was sent by Shook Lin to
                    Rajah &amp; Tann on 29 January 2009 with content similar to the e-mail
                    agreement. As such, it is clear that the agreement to allow the Defendant to pay
                    50% of the royalties first was linked to the condition that the parties would
                    enter into a new addendum. In a telephone conversation on 20 February 2009,
                    the Defendant asked for more time to execute the addenda and pay the outstanding
                    royalties which it claimed was its leverage. This was followed by a letter from
                    Shook Lin to Rajah &amp; Tann stating that the payments:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... were to facilitate the conduct of further negotiations leading up to
                        the execution of new agreements or addenda by latest <u>27 February 2009</u>, failing which our clients will
                        proceed to enforce their strict legal rights under the Media Agreement, Demo
                        Agreement and/or in law. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the Defendant did not take any steps to execute the new
                    addenda and failed to revert to the Plaintiff as promised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 25 February 2009, the Plaintiff then
                    sent Chew an e-mail stating that it had yet to hear from him, that it was
                    setting a firm deadline through its lawyers, and urging him to sign the addenda.
                    The following extracts from the letter are relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You have said that you will call me but todate [<em>sic</em>], I have yet to hear from you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have tried all means and bend over backwards to get this to progress but
                        to no avail. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Raymond, may I humbly urge you to see the potential and future of the
                        business and drop old baggage so that with the remaining few days we could
                        work it out by completing and signing the addenda.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Plaintiff then sent another letter dated 25 February 2009,
                    through Shook Lin to Rajah &amp; Tann, giving the Defendant an ultimatum of
                    9.00am on 2 March 2009 to execute the addendum. However, neither the
                    Defendant nor Rajah &amp; Tann responded to any of the above correspondence and
                    the Defendant failed to execute the addenda by the stipulated time. The
                    Plaintiff then issued the Second Termination Notice on 3 March
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In light of the terms of the e-mail agreement
                    and the Defendant’s conduct in failing to comply with its terms, I find
                    that the Defendant failed to discharge its burden of proving that the Plaintiff
                    wrongfully terminated the 2004 Agreement. I find that it was a condition of the
                    e-mail agreement that the Defendant would sign the new addenda by the end of
                    February 2009, failing which the Plaintiff could exercise its right to terminate
                    the contract. As the Defendant failed to take any steps towards signing the new
                    addenda despite the Plaintiff’s multiple calls and letters urging the
                    former to do so, including the ultimatum of 25 February 2009, I hold that
                    the Plaintiff was entitled to exercise its right to terminate the 2004
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement was a restraint of trade
                clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the amended Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 2), the Plaintiff sought an injunction “restraining [the Defendant]
                    from using the Licensed System or any part thereof”. It further sought an
                    injunction restraining the Defendant from:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    Using the Cloned Products;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  Passing off … the Plaintiff’s
                            Licensed System and/or Licensed Products as their own (either by way of
                            name and/or get up) in the form of the Cloned Products or otherwise and
                            making representations to this effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In its Counterclaim, the Defendant sought a
                    declaration that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement was an unreasonable restraint of
                    trade clause that ought to be found void and struck out. Counsel for the
                    Defendant argued that cl 9.3 was a restraint of trade clause as it satisfied the
                    test adopted by the Court of Appeal in <em>National Aerated Water
                        Co Pte Ltd v Monarch Co, Inc</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 74 at [27],
                    following <em>Petrofina (Gt. Britain) Ltd v Martin</em>
                    [1966] Ch 146, <em>viz</em>, whether the clause purported
                    to “restrict [the Defendant’s] liberty in the future to carry on
                    trade with other persons not parties to the contract in such manner as he
                    chooses”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Clause 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement reads
                    thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the termination of this Agreement … the Licensee shall retain
                        no rights to the Licensed System or any part thereof, all such rights having
                        been deemed to have been surrendered to the Licensor. For the avoidance of
                        doubt, the Licensee hereby agrees that upon the termination of this
                        Agreement, it will refrain from making use of the Licensed System, or any
                        part thereof, or anything resembling or similar to the said system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the difficulty arises from the vague and amorphous definition
                    of “the Licensed System”. In Recital 2 of the 2004 Agreement, the
                    Licensed System was defined thus: “the Name, Licensed Marks and Licensed
                    Products [are] collectively referred to as ‘the Licensed
                    System’.” However, the term “Name” was not defined.
                    The term “Licensed Marks” was vaguely defined as “various
                    logos and intellectual property” without further specification. Only the
                    term “Licensed Products” was set out with some particularity in
                    Schedule A, where various hardware products such as “Shelf Vision”
                    and “Cart Vision” were listed. Tellingly, under cross-examination,
                    Ng admitted that he was not entirely sure what was covered by the terms
                    “Licensed Marks” and “Name” as they were not clearly
                    defined in the 2004 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Furthermore, despite initially refusing the
                    Defendant’s request for further and better particulars as to what the
                    Licensed System comprised, the Plaintiff later amended the Statement of Claim to
                    include a broad and vague list of nebulously defined items that were said to be
                    part of the Licensed System. Even a cursory examination of the list would reveal
                    that the alleged Licensed System as so defined is too broad and vague to be
                    reasonable in protecting a legitimate interest on the part of the Plaintiff. The
                    list includes such expansive formulations as “the innovative concept of
                    using the ‘5-senses’ in relation to in-store advertising”.
                    Item (ii) in the list, <em>viz</em>, “the knowledge,
                    methodology and know-how for in-store advertising and sales strategies”
                    – again is very extensive. The Plaintiff cannot attempt to protect mere
                    ideas in such a draconian manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As though the sweep of the definition of
                    “Licensed System” was not wide enough, cl 9.3 went on to prohibit
                    the Defendant from engaging in “anything resembling or similar to the
                    said system”. In short, cl 9.3 appears to restrict the Defendant from
                    participating in the in-store advertising business altogether. Quite apart from
                    the legitimacy of the interest it seeks to protect, I find that cl 9.3 is
                    simply too wide to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The next issue that arises is the
                    Plaintiff’s alternative claim for inverse passing off. It should be noted
                    that the Plaintiff is suing for a tort allegedly committed in a foreign
                    jurisdiction. Although it was not raised by either party, a preliminary question
                    that should be considered is whether, given the state of the pleadings, the
                    court can restrain the acts of passing off that occurred outside
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The learned author of <em>The
                        Law of Passing-off</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011),
                    Christopher Wadlow, at para 10–063 observed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it came to be recognised that conduct in a foreign country which would
                        have been actionable as passing-off had it occurred in England could be
                        restrained by the English courts, and damages awarded, if the latter had
                        personal jurisdiction over the defendant ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff must
                    show that it possessed goodwill in its goods and services in both the country of
                    the alleged tort of passing (<em>ie</em>, Malaysia) and the
                    country in which the claim was brought (<em>ie</em>, Singapore). This is not, strictly speaking, conceptually
                    correct. It is not disputed that the court has personal jurisdiction over the
                    Defendant, and hence jurisdiction to hear the claim for passing off. However, it
                    may be relevant to consider whether the Plaintiff was required to plead and
                    prove Malaysian law in relation to passing off given that all the alleged acts
                    of passing off occurred in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As a starting point, the applicable choice of
                    law rule is the “double actionability rule” formulated by Willes J
                    in <em>Phillips v Eyre</em> (1870) LR 6 QB 1
                        (“<em>Phillips</em>”) at 28–29
                    where the learned judge observed thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As a general rule, in order to found a suit in England for a wrong
                        alleged to have been committed abroad, two conditions must be fulfilled.
                        First, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been
                        actionable if committed in England; ... Secondly, the act must not have been
                        justifiable by the law of the place where it was done. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in order a for tort committed abroad to be actionable in England
                    (a) the wrong had to be of such a character as to be actionable under English
                    law (the <em>lex </em><em>fori</em>) if it were committed in England; and (b) the act had also
                    to be actionable under the law of the country where it was committed (the
                        <em>lex loci delicti</em>). Both limbs had to be
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This was later modified by the House of
                    Lords’ decision in <em>Boys v Chaplin</em> [1971] AC
                    356. Although the House of Lords affirmed the double actionability rule, an
                    exception was introduced in the speeches of Lords Wilberforce and Hodson,
                    admitting of the possibility that under certain circumstances a foreign tort
                    might still be actionable in England even though it was not actionable under the
                        <em>lex loci delicti</em>. Then followed the Privy
                    Council decision in <em>Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues
                        SA</em> [1995] 1 AC 190 (“the <em>Red
                        Sea</em> case”) which further extended the exception so that
                    “[it] could equally be invoked to disapply the <em>lex
                        </em><em>fori</em> (the first [limb] of the rule
                    of double actionability) and to secure the sole application of the <em>lex loci delicti </em><em>commissi</em>” (Dicey, Morris and Collins, <em>The
                        Conflicts of Laws</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006)
                        (“<em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em>”) vol 2 at
                    para 35-007).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The double actionability rule as modified by
                    the exception in <em>Boys v Chaplin</em> and the <em>Red Sea</em> case has been held by our Court of Appeal to be
                    the law in Singapore: see <em>Parno v SC Marine Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 377 at [36] and <em>Rickshaw
                        Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Rickshaw
                        Investments</em>”) at [53]–[56]. Thus, the position in
                    Singapore is that the double actionability rule applies but under certain
                    circumstances the wrong committed abroad might still be actionable in Singapore
                    even though either of the two limbs referred to above is not satisfied: see
                        <em>Rickshaw Investments</em> at [56].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Doubts, however, remain as to when the
                    exception could be invoked and as to the circumstances which would warrant its
                    application in particular cases (see <em>Dicey &amp;
                        Morris</em> vol 2 at para 35-008). Fortunately, it is not necessary
                    for the purposes of this case to determine the boundaries of the
                    exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In relation to the second limb of the rule in
                        <em>Phillips</em>, the court in <em>Alteco Chemical Pte Ltd v Chong Yean Wah</em>
                    [1999] 2 SLR(R) 915 at [48] emphasised the importance of pleading
                    foreign law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Foreign passing off</em> occurs when
                        production and palming off occur in a foreign country and nothing happens in
                        the land of the forum. <b><em>In such a case, as all the
                            factors are foreign, foreign law becomes very material.</em></b> It
                        must be shown by the claimant that it is actionable by the law of the
                        country where the palming off takes place. The proposition of private
                        international law that foreign law is <em>prima
                            facie</em> presumed to be same as the law of the forum does
                        not apply. [emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Plaintiff in the present case has not
                    specifically pleaded the law of passing off as it stands in Malaysia. In the
                    absence of pleadings on foreign law, “the court will in principle decide
                    a case containing foreign elements as though it were a purely domestic
                    case”
                    <em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em> ([34] <em>supra</em>) vol 1 at para 9-003 . In other words, the court will
                    presume the position under foreign law to be the same as that under the
                        <em>lex </em><em>fori</em>
                        (<em>Rickshaw Investments</em> at [43]; <em>Goh </em><em>Chok Tong v Tang Liang
                        Hong</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 811 at [84]; see also <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, vol 6(2)
                    (LexisNexis, 2009), para 75.300) (“<em>Halsbury’s
                        Singapore</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However, the presumption that the position
                    under foreign law is similar to the <em>lex </em><em>fori</em> does not apply in every case. I note the
                    observations in <em>D’Oz International Pte Ltd v PSB Corp
                        Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2010] 3 SLR 267 at
                    [25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the presumption [of similarity of laws] is a rule of convenience which
                        the courts may resort to unless it is unjust and inconvenient to do so. ...
                        Whether a common law court will presume foreign law to be the same
                        as the <em>lex </em><em>fori</em> in any case where foreign law is
                        not pleaded or not proved (if pleaded) depends on the circumstances of each
                        case. The question that is ordinarily asked when the presumption is invoked
                        is whether, in the circumstances of the case, it would be unjust to apply it
                        against a party so as to make him liable on a claim subject to foreign law
                        when the claimant has failed to prove what the foreign law is and how
                        liability is established under that foreign law ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">One situation in which the presumption may not apply is where an
                    injunction is sought to restrain a wrong committed in the foreign jurisdiction
                        (<em>Halsbury’s </em><em>Singapore</em> at para 75.300). Proof of civil liability in the
                    foreign jurisdiction may be necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     An examination of a few cases on this point is
                    apposite. In <em>Alfred Dunhill v Sunoptic SA</em> [1979]
                    FSR 337 (“<em>Alfred Dunhill</em>”), the
                    plaintiffs sought a worldwide interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendant
                    from using the word “DUNHILL” on the defendant’s sunglasses
                    and spectacle frames in multiple countries. The English Court of Appeal granted
                    an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from carrying on acts of
                    passing off in England and Switzerland. There was evidence that under Swiss law,
                    the Swiss courts would have restrained the defendant’s acts on proof of
                    confusion. However, the interlocutory injunction was refused in respect of other
                    countries because the plaintiff had not adduced evidence of the local law in
                    those jurisdictions (<em>Alfred Dunhill</em> at
                    368).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The case of <em>An
                        </em><em>Bord </em><em>Trachtala v
                        Waterford Foods plc</em> [1994] FSR 316 is also relevant. The
                    plaintiffs sought to injunct the defendant from using an allegedly similar logo
                    on products marketed and distributed in England. The High Court of Ireland
                    applied the double actionability rule. The plaintiff relied on a letter from
                    English solicitors on the law of passing off in England to satisfy the second
                    limb of the double actionability rule. However, the interlocutory injunction was
                    refused because the plaintiff failed to satisfy the court that the
                    defendant’s activities in England would have amounted to passing off. I
                    similarly hold in the present case that the double actionability rule applies
                    and that the presumption that the position under Malaysian law is the same as
                    under Singapore law does not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Plaintiff did not submit on the
                    applicability of the double actionability rule nor plead Malaysian law in
                    relation to passing off. Although the Plaintiff relied on the Malaysian case of
                        <em>Seet Chuan Seng v Tee Yih </em><em>Jia Foods Manufacturing Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 2 MLJ 770 which affirmed
                    principles of passing off which were similar to those under Singapore law, that
                    is neither pleading nor proof of Malaysian law. In any event, even if I accept
                    that the principles of passing off under Singapore law should be applied in the
                    present case, for the reasons which follow, the Plaintiff would not succeed in
                    its claim for inverse passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Elements of passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Court of Appeal in <em>Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 216 at
                    [37] set out the “three clearly identifiable core concepts which are
                    fundamental to a passing off action, namely, goodwill, misrepresentation and
                    damage”. The court followed Lord Oliver’s holding in <em>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc</em> [1990] 1
                    WLR 491 (“the <em>Jif Lemon</em> case”) where
                    his Lordship stated (at 499):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general
                        proposition – no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More
                        specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the
                        plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are
                        three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached
                        to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing
                        public by association with the identifying ‘get-up’ (whether it
                        consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual
                        features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or
                        services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by
                        the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff’s goods or
                        services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant
                        to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the
                        public to believe that goods or services offered by [the defendant] are the
                        goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the
                        plaintiff’s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or
                        services is immaterial, as long as [the goods or services] are identified
                        with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff. For example, if the
                        public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing
                        goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is
                        little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand
                        name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet
                        action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief
                        engendered by the defendant’s misrepresentation that the source of the
                        defendant’s goods or services is the same as the source of those
                        offered by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the case of inverse passing off, the
                    defendant misrepresents the plaintiff’s goods or services as his own:
                        <em>Tessensohn Denyse Bernadette v John Robert Powers School
                        Inc</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 470 (“<em>Tessensohn</em>”). The Court of Appeal in <em>Tessensohn</em> affirmed at [25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The three essential elements of passing off <em>equally
                            apply</em> to such [<em>ie</em>, inverse]
                        passing off as well. Therefore, to succeed in an action for inverse passing
                        off, a plaintiff must prove that there is goodwill attached to their goods
                        or services; that the defendants misrepresented themselves as the commercial
                        source of the goods or services in question; and that the plaintiff's
                        goodwill was damaged as a consequence. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This was similarly affirmed in <em>QB Net Co Ltd v
                        Earnson Management (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR 1 (“<em>QB Net</em>”) at [16].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The first element that the Plaintiff must
                    establish is goodwill. There are two issues relating to goodwill which must be
                    shown:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Plaintiff has trade within
                        the jurisdiction (<em>ie</em>, Malaysia) to which
                        goodwill attaches;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     that goodwill subsisted in the names and get-up of the
                        Plaintiff’s Licensed System or Licensed Products.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Trade within the jurisdiction to which goodwill attaches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Goodwill has been defined as “the
                    benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business
                    ... the attractive force which brings in custom” (see: <em>The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller &amp; Co’s
                        Margarine Limited</em> [1901] AC 217 at 223–224). As a general
                    rule, goodwill subsists only where a trader has business presence in the
                    jurisdiction (<em>CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 975 at [46] (“<em>CDL Hotels</em>”); <em>Star Industrial Co Ltd v
                        Yap Kwee Kor</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 17). Goodwill cannot exist
                    independently but is attached to a business. It is not sufficient to show that a
                    trader has reputation without business presence in the jurisdiction (<em>CDL Hotels</em> at [50]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     A foreign licensor, like the Plaintiff, who
                    supplies products to a licensee can have goodwill in the jurisdiction in which
                    the licensee operates. This proposition was not disputed in <em>QB Net</em> ([44] <em>supra</em>) and <em>Kickapoo (Malaysia) Sdn </em><em>Bhd v The
                        Monarch Beverage Co (Europe) Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1212
                        (“<em>Monarch</em>”). The licensors in
                        <em>QB Net</em> and <em>Monarch</em> did not operate their business directly in Singapore but
                    entered into licence agreements with local proprietors to supply products and
                    services. It was not disputed that the foreign licensors could establish
                    goodwill despite not operating in their own right in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Monarch</em>, the
                    court considered that the more contentious issue was whether the goodwill
                    subsisted with the licensor or licensee on the facts. The House of Lords in
                        <em>Scandecor Developments AB v Scandecor Marketing
                        AB</em> [2002] FSR 7 (“<em>Scandecor</em>”) suggested that the business source indicated by a
                    trade mark could be the licensee or the licensor, depending on the facts. The
                    English Court of Appeal took a “wider interpretation” that the
                    source of a mark may either be the proprietor of the mark or its licensee
                        (<em>Scandecor</em> at [38]). This had implications for
                    the law of passing off because it would be difficult for a licensor to succeed
                    in an action for passing off against a licensee if the public associates the
                    goods with the licensee and not the licensor (<em>Monarch</em> at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     While the approach in <em>Scandecor</em> was seen as a “commercially sensible
                    one”, Andrew Phang JA, in <em>Monarch</em>, opined
                    that much caution must be exercised in deciding whether to adopt this approach
                        (<em>Monarch</em> at [45]). Phang JA was of the
                    view that it would be preferable to await further developments in this area of
                    the law before adopting the approach in <em>Scandecor</em>.
                    He highlighted that <em>Scandecor’s</em> approach
                    would lead to several points of uncertainty. First, it would mean that a trade
                    mark proprietor who licenses his trade mark always risks the loss of
                    distinctiveness in his mark. This has legal and commercial implications for many
                    licensing arrangements (<em>Monarch</em> at [48]). Second,
                    the reasoning in <em>Scandecor</em> appears to be
                    consistent with exclusive bare licences but not necessarily non-exclusive
                    licences (<em>Monarch</em> at [49]). Third, <em>Scandecor</em> has not “gained much traction in other
                    common law jurisdictions” (<em>Monarch</em> at
                    [50]). Phang JA further observed that the <em>Scandecor</em> approach is heavily fact-dependent and the onus is on
                    the defendant to demonstrate that the public no longer associates the trade
                    source of the products with the licensor. He noted at [53] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A few concluding observations might be apposite. Although, as mentioned
                        above (at [45]), we do not propose to express a concluded view as to
                        which approach is preferable, our emphasis on the importance of the
                        particular factual matrix as expressed in the preceding paragraph may, in
                        fact, give us a clue as to whether or not both approaches (<em>viz</em>, the traditional approach on the one hand and
                        the more modern approach as embodied in Lord Nicholls’s approach in
                            <em>Scandecor</em> ([37] <em>supra</em>) on the other) are, in fact, <em>wholly</em> irreconciliable ones. It appears to us – and
                        this is but a <b><em>passing observation</em></b>, and no
                        more – that <em>yet another possible</em>
                        approach which might well constitute a <b>‘</b><b><em>middle way’ between both
                            the approaches just mentioned is to adopt, as a starting-point (by way
                            of a rebuttable presumption), the traditional approach (viz, that the
                            source of the goods concerned is the trade mark
                            proprietor)</em></b><b>.</b> This presumption,
                        however, can be rebutted by clear evidence along the lines set out in the
                        preceding paragraph. It might well be argued that this is, in <em>substance</em>, Lord Nicholls’s modern approach
                        – not least because, under that approach, the defendant would have (as
                        mentioned in the preceding paragraph) to adduce convincing facts in order to
                        demonstrate that a shift of association (from the trade mark proprietor to
                        the licensee) has occurred. If so, then the case in favour of this
                        ‘middle way’ becomes an <em>a fortiori</em> one. However, as already emphasised
                        above (in the preceding paragraph) this particular legal conundrum was not
                        directly before the court and it cannot be overemphasised
                            that, <em>regardless of the approach
                            applied</em>, the result would have been <em>the same</em> in any event. [emphasis in original in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the present case, the Plaintiff did not
                    operate directly in Malaysia. However, the Plaintiff supplied the Licensed
                    System and Licensed Products to the Defendant who in turn provided in-store
                    advertising media services in Malaysia. It is possible for the Plaintiff to
                    acquire goodwill in Malaysia through the licensing of its system and products to
                    the Defendant. The Defendant maintained that while it is clear that the
                    Defendant possessed goodwill in the in-store advertising business in Malaysia,
                    the Plaintiff has not shown proof that it has goodwill in Malaysia. The
                    Defendant did not argue, however, that <em>Scandecor</em>
                    should be followed. The Court of Appeal has suspended adopting a definitive view
                    on whether <em>Scandecor</em>’s approach applies in
                    Singapore and, in any event, my decision on whether to adopt <em>Scandecor</em>’s approach is not strictly necessary to dispose
                    of the issue of goodwill. I thus prefer to proceed on the basis that the
                    Plaintiff may have goodwill in Malaysia notwithstanding that it does not carry
                    on business there.</p>

                        connection with the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The subject matter in which the Plaintiff
                    alleges it had goodwill can be classified into three broad categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     Names of the Licensed
                        Products;</p>

                        and other services.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Names of the Licensed Products</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Plaintiff claims goodwill in the names of
                    the Licensed Products, including “Shelf Vision” (for
                    advertisements mounted on shelves) and “Cart Vision (for
                    advertisements mounted on supermarket trolleys). The names of the
                    Plaintiff’s Licensed Products are undoubtedly descriptive. In relation to
                    descriptive marks, the Court of Appeal in <em>Lifestyle 1.99 Pte
                        Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 687 (“<em>Lifestyle 1.99</em>”) held that the threshold for
                    proving goodwill is high. The Plaintiff must show that the mark acquired a
                    secondary meaning, <em>ie</em>, that the mark has become
                    distinctive of the plaintiff’s business (<em>Lifestyle
                        1.99</em> at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Plaintiff, however, has not adduced any
                    evidence to prove this. Evidence from a survey relied on by the Plaintiff ([60]
                        <em>infra</em>) did not establish that the Plaintiff
                    had goodwill in names of the Licensed Products. The survey participants,
                    comprising of food product manufacturers, retailers and media agencies, were not
                    asked whether they would associate the names of the Licensed Products with the
                    products and services of the Plaintiff. (Significantly, on 9 September
                    2000, the arbitral tribunal that adjudicated a dispute between the Plaintiff and
                    ActMedia Canada held that the Plaintiff did not have goodwill in the names of
                    the Licensed Products including “Shelf Vision”,
                    “Instant Coupon Machine” and “Freezer Vision” in the
                    Asia Pacific region, but that the goodwill belonged instead to ActMedia
                    Canada.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Get-up of the Licensed System and Licensed
                Products</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The tort of passing off protects goodwill
                    associated with packaging and trade dress: “A person may acquire goodwill
                    through use of particular packaging or get-up for their products.” See:
                    Bently and Sherman, <em>Intellectual Property Law</em>
                    (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2009) at p 732. However, the court has noted
                    that the threshold for establishing goodwill in respect of
                    “get-up” is high. In <em>QB Net</em> ([44]
                        <em>supra</em>), Lai Siu Chiu J held thus at
                    [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the threshold for establishing goodwill in this respect is generally
                        quite high. A plaintiff who asserts goodwill in its get-up must show the
                        presence of particular features in its goods and services which are
                        ‘capricious’ (<em>ie</em>, not common to
                        the trade) but which have come to be associated with the plaintiff’s
                        goods. A plaintiff thus faces a difficult task in proving goodwill and he
                        will fail unless he can adduce ‘strong persuasive evidence’ in
                        this respect: ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In Tan Tee Jim, <em>Law of
                        Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, 2005) (“<em>Tan Tee Jim</em>”) the
                    learned author observed at para 17.39 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a particular feature of goods or services can be regarded as
                        capricious if it is arbitrarily chosen from a broad range of equally
                        acceptable alternatives. The feature is not capricious if it is rationally
                        dictated by demands of function, efficiency, cost of production, available
                        materials and the like considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The courts will not protect get-up that is
                    “common to the trade” under the tort of passing off. The Plaintiff
                    must show that the get-up of the Licensed System is capricious and associated
                    with its goods and services. The court in <em>QB Net</em>
                    found that the elements comprising the QB House ten-minute express haircut
                    services system, such as the lack of both cash registers and reservations
                    systems were not distinctive features that were associated with the
                    plaintiff’s services. These elements could be easily observed by members
                    of the public and were well documented in the hairdressing industry (at
                    [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... While it is arguable that the plaintiff’s use of a
                        ticket-vending machine, electronic sensors and a no-reservations system are
                        unusual features of a haircut salon, these factors in themselves are
                        insufficient to warrant a finding of goodwill. It should be noted that the
                        plaintiff’s use of a special vacuum cleaner to remove freshly cut
                        hair, the use of working cabinets which minimise the movement of
                        hairdressers whilst at work and the ten-minute service offered by the
                        plaintiff are insufficiently distinctive to support a finding of goodwill.
                        After all, it can be argued that this particular style or get-up is
                        characteristic of the haircut trade and open for all in that trade to adopt,
                        as long as sufficient care is taken to distinguish the source of the
                        services and products in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Plaintiff is trying to assert goodwill in
                    the use of red shelf-mounting brackets which hold up mounted advertising boards
                    that engage one or more of the five senses. It also claimed goodwill in an
                    amorphous “innovative concept of using the ‘5 senses’ in
                    relation to in-store advertising”. I find the use of shelf-mounted
                    advertisements and the concept of engaging the five senses through in-store
                    advertising very general marketing ideas employed by various players in the
                    in-store advertising market. There could not be said to be a capricious addition
                    in the get-up of the Licensed Products that have come to be associated with the
                    Plaintiff’s goods and was sufficiently distinctive to form the subject
                    matter of goodwill. The “look and feel” of the shelf-mounted
                    advertisements depended on how the products displayed could be best advertised.
                    There were no features in the shelf-mounted advertisements or red shelf brackets
                    that were capricious features indicative of the Plaintiff’s goods and
                    services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In addition, the Plaintiff has not adduced
                    sufficient evidence to show that the Malaysian public associated the get-up of
                    the Licensed System or Licensed Products with the Plaintiff’s products and
                    services. In <em>Tan Tee Jim</em> ([56] <em>supra</em>), the author notes at para 17.17 that “in practice,
                    the owner usually proves the existence of reputation and goodwill by …
                    showing that a substantial section of the public associates him with the
                    mark”. This is especially crucial where the get-up of the goods or
                    services is common to the trade. He further observes that such cases
                    “require strong persuasive evidence” to succeed. In the <em>Jif Lemon</em> case ([43] <em>supra</em>), the plaintiff managed to adduce sufficient evidence to show
                    that the public associated its lemon-shaped squeeze pack containing lemon juice
                    with goods originating from “Jif”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I find that the Plaintiff failed to prove that
                    it had goodwill in the Licensed System. The Plaintiff’s counsel pointed me
                    to a survey conducted by the Defendant in 2010 which indicated that 39% of the
                    survey sample identified “ActMedia” as one of the companies
                    providing in-store advertising services in Malaysia. However, this is
                    insufficient evidence for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     First, this survey merely demonstrates that
                    the public had general recognition of the ActMedia name. Further, it appears
                    that there was little or no recognition of the Plaintiff’s name
                    “OMG Holdings”, which it adopted with effect from 7 November
                    2006. In any event, the tort of passing off does not protect a name <em>per se</em>, but rather the owner’s goodwill in the
                    business under that name or the goods or services which he
                supplies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Second, the 39% prompted recall of the
                    ActMedia name does not show that the Plaintiff had any goodwill in the products
                    or concepts that allegedly form part of the Licensed System. The survey
                    participants were simply asked whether they were aware that ActMedia operated in
                    Malaysia. They were not asked whether they associated certain features of
                    in-store advertisements with a particular source that was in fact the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between
                    the Plaintiff and ActMedia Canada (entered into after arbitral proceedings), the
                    Plaintiff does not even have the rights to the ActMedia name or goodwill in the
                    Licensed System. Indeed, in the present action the Plaintiff did not make it
                    entirely clear which Licensed System it was claiming to hold goodwill in: was it
                    the licensed system as sub-licensed from ActMedia Canada and defined in the 1993
                    Agreement, or the “Licensed System” as defined in the 2002 and
                    2004 Agreements post-termination of the Plaintiff’s relationship with
                    ActMedia Canada? If the Plaintiff is claiming goodwill in the former, it seems
                    somewhat of a stretch to say that the Plaintiff continued to have goodwill in
                    the Licensed System where the Master Licence Agreement had already been
                    terminated. If the Plaintiff is claiming goodwill in the latter, <em>ie</em>, the “Licensed System” as defined in
                    the 2002 and 2004 Agreements, it has not adduced evidence to prove that it has
                    goodwill in the get-up of the Licensed System or the names of the Licensed
                    Products such as “Shelf Vision” and “Cart
                    Vision”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Methodology of in-store advertising and other
                services</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Plaintiff further tries to allege goodwill
                    in its methodology and know-how for in-store advertising. To establish goodwill
                    in a particular sales methodology is not an easy task. The plaintiff in
                        <em>OTO Bodycare Pte Ltd v Hiew </em><em>Keat </em><em>Foong</em> [2005] SGHC 133
                    claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant’s
                    use of a similar sales methodology confused purchasers into buying the
                    defendant’s products, thinking that they were the plaintiff’s. The
                    plaintiff frequently displayed its products in open spaces and road shows for
                    customers to try them out. The court found that there was no passing off in
                    relation to this sales methodology because the plaintiff’s sales
                    methodology did not appear to be particularly unique. Similarly, I find that the
                    Plaintiff’s Licensed System comprised simply of general marketing
                    strategies intended to bring the consumer’s attention to the products
                    advertised. There were no unique features in the Plaintiff’s advertising
                    methodology that could be said to be associated exclusively with the
                    Plaintiff’s goods or services.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether the Plaintiff could establish goodwill by
                estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Plaintiff further asserts that, in any
                    event, the issue of existence and accrual of goodwill was already decided by
                    agreement between the parties, and the element of goodwill is thus satisfied.
                    This argument appears attractive at first blush. The Plaintiff relies on Recital
                    (1) of the 2004 Agreement which stated that “the Licensor [the Plaintiff]
                    has developed significant goodwill in the Asia market”. The Plaintiff
                    also cited the following passage from <em>The Law of
                        Passing-off</em> ([31] <em>supra</em>) at para
                    3–147:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the commercial purpose of an agreement is to license the use of a
                            <em>distinctive name or mark</em> in respect of
                        which the licensor has (or is agreed to have) goodwill, to a licensee who
                        has (or is agreed to have) no such goodwill, and and in circumstances where
                        the licensee’s use would <em>otherwise be actionable as
                            passing-off</em>, then in the absence of agreement to the contrary
                        or other supervening factors, the goodwill in the business so carried on by
                        the licensee under the licensed name or mark will accrue to the licensor
                        rather than the licensee. ... The licensee acquires no interest in the
                        licensed name or mark, and must cease using it on termination of the
                        licence. ... It is irrelevant whether the goodwill in the licensed business
                        would otherwise have accrued to the licensee, the licensor, or both. ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I doubt that the Plaintiff’s reliance on
                    the foregoing passage in <em>The Law of
                        Passing-Off</em> advances its case. Read in context, the learned
                    author of <em>The Law of Passing-off</em> was referring to
                    the vesting (<em>ie</em>, ownership) of goodwill, and not
                    the establishment of the <em>existence</em> of goodwill, by
                    agreement. Further, the learned author’s observations were premised on
                    there being “a distinctive name or mark”, and where the
                    licensee’s use would <em>otherwise</em> be actionable
                    as passing off. He was not suggesting that agreed facts in a recital could
                    establish the existence of goodwill <em>per se</em>. I
                    should add, however, that the learned author of <em>The Law of
                        Passing-off</em> went on to observe at para 3-147 that “the
                    proposition [that an agreement on ownership of goodwill is binding as between
                    the parties] applies to similar agreements when there is no pre-existing
                    goodwill, or when ownership of such goodwill as already exists is uncertain or
                    controversial”. It is not clear whether the learned author, by this
                    observation, was suggesting that goodwill could accrue to the licensor by
                    agreement where there was no pre-existing goodwill. Even if this was what the
                    learned author intended to suggest, no authority was cited in support. Only the
                    case of <em>Gromax </em><em>Plasticulture
                        Ltd v Don &amp; Low Nonwovens Ltd</em> [1999] RPC 367 was cited for
                    the proposition that an estoppel by convention could establish the question of
                        <em>ownership</em> of goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Plaintiff also relied on the case of
                        <em>A S Nordlandsbanken v Nederkoorn Robin
                        Hoddle</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 918 (“<em>Nordlandsbanken</em>”) for the proposition that recitals in an
                    agreement are binding on the parties. <em>Nordlandsbanken</em> and the authorities examined in that case
                    related to the doctrine of estoppel by deed. The licence agreements in the
                    present case were not deeds. It is thus necessary for me to examine whether the
                    parties are similarly bound by recitals in the licence agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Recitals are usually not regarded as terms of
                    the agreement which give rise to legal obligations; they form the
                    background to a transaction (Richard Christou, <em>Boilerplate:
                        Practical Clauses</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2010). However,
                    it has been established that a party to a deed can be estopped from disputing
                    the facts and recitals in a deed (<em>Lainson v
                        Tremere</em> (1834) 1 Ad &amp; El 792; <em>Greer and
                        Another v Kettle</em> [1938] AC 156). The authors of Spencer Bower,
                        <em>The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation</em>
                    (LexisNexis UK, 2004) (“<em>Spencer
                    Bower</em>”) explain at para VIII.13.1 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The necessity of finding that a recital was intended to be an agreement to
                        admit its truth by the party to be estopped reveals the true foundation of
                        the modern doctrine of estoppel by deed <em>inter
                            partes</em>. For, an intention to be bound by agreement is a
                        contractual intention, and the requirement of consideration is obviated by
                        execution of the deed: the parties are, therefore, estopped by contract.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It appears that the doctrine of estoppel in
                    relation to recitals has been extended to instruments not by deed. Parke B J in
                        <em>Carpenter v Buller</em> (1841) 151 ER 1013 observed
                    at 1014 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a distinct statement of a particular fact is made in the recital of a
                        bond, or other instrument under seal, and a contract is made with reference
                        to that recital, it is unquestionably true, that, as between the parties to
                        that instrument, and in an action upon it, it is not competent for the party
                        bound to deny the recital, ... <em>and a recital in
                            instruments not under seal may be such as to be conclusive to the same
                            extent</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Another closely related doctrine is the
                    doctrine of estoppel by convention. It is established that parties can be bound
                    by a state of facts or law which they mutually assumed to form the basis of
                    their contractual obligations (see <em>Spencer Bower</em>
                    at para VIII.7.2). Parties are in substance bound by contract rather than
                    estoppel where the estoppel is founded on non-operative words of an
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I find that it is more conceptually consistent
                    for a recital in an agreement not by deed to be similarly capable of giving rise
                    to an estoppel by convention, where the proposition in the recital was
                    contemplated by the parties and intended to be an agreement between them. The
                    distinction in the requirement of consideration between a deed and an agreement
                    not under seal should not prevent a party from relying on a recital in such
                    agreement to establish estoppel by convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     However, I find that the Plaintiff cannot
                    satisfy the element of goodwill even if the recital in the 2004 Agreement estops
                    the parties from disputing the issue of goodwill. By arguing that the recital is
                    conclusive of the existence of goodwill, the Plaintiff is attempting to use the
                    doctrine of estoppel by convention as a sword and not merely a shield. It is
                    established that the doctrine of estoppel by convention cannot be used to
                    establish a cause of action because it cannot create new rights where they did
                    not previously exist (<em>Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property
                        Co Ltd v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd</em> [1982] 1 QB 84
                        (“<em>Amalgamated Investment</em>”);
                        <em>The Vistafjord</em> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
                    343; <em>Baird Textiles Holdings Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer
                        plc</em> [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 737 at [33]; <em>Riverside Housing Association Ltd v White and White</em> [2005] EWCA
                    Civ 1385 (“<em>Riverside Housing</em>”)
                    (reversed on appeal by the House of Lords but on different grounds)). Estoppel
                    cannot be used as a free-standing element to create a cause of
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The English Court of Appeal case of <em>Amalgamated Investment</em> is pertinent. The facts of the
                    case are somewhat involved. The plaintiff company negotiated with the defendant
                    bank to finance its property development project in Bahamas. The banks granted a
                    loan of US$3m to one of the plaintiff’s Bahamian subsidiaries, Gleniston.
                    This was secured on a property in the Bahamas, Harrison Building. The bank also
                    granted loan facilities secured over the plaintiff’s properties in
                    England. Later, the plaintiff negotiated for the loan to Gleniston to be
                    transferred to another subsidiary of the plaintiff, ANPP. The loan amount was
                    also increased to US$3.25m (“the Nassau loan”) and likewise
                    secured on Harrison Building which was transferred from Gleniston to ANPP. In
                    addition, the plaintiff gave a guarantee, by which it undertook to pay all
                    moneys owed by ANPP to the bank (“the guarantee”). To circumvent
                    certain complications under Bahamian law, the bank subsequently decided to
                    incorporate a Bahamaian subsidiary, Portsoken, by acquiring a shelf company in
                    the Bahamas. The arrangement was that the bank would lend Portsoken moneys which
                    Portsoken would then re-lend to ANPP. However, the guarantee was not altered to
                    cover moneys owed by ANPP to Portsoken. The plaintiff later went into
                    liquidation. The bank and Portsoken appointed receivers to sell the properties
                    in England and the Harrison Building respectively. The bank later sought to
                    apply the surplus from the sale of the English properties to the outstanding
                    moneys on the Nassau loan. The plaintiff’s liquidators sought a
                    declaration that the plaintiff was not liable on the guarantee to the bank,
                    arguing that the moneys advanced under the Nassau loan were owed to Portsoken
                    and not the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The English Court of Appeal dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s claim, finding that the guarantee was wide enough to include
                    the loan by Portsoken to ANPP, based on the correspondence and negotiations of
                    the parties (<em>Amalgamated Investment</em> at 119, 125,
                    127 and 129). The parties negotiated on the basis that the plaintiff would be
                    liable to discharge the moneys under the Nassau loan. Eveleigh and Brandon LJJ
                    also agreed that even if the wording of the guarantee could not be construed to
                    cover the Nassau loan, the plaintiff was estopped by convention from denying
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     However, both Eveleigh and Brandon LJJ
                    acknowledged that an estoppel by convention could not be used to found a cause
                    of action by the bank. Only Denning MR took the contrary view that the bank
                    could have sued on the “conventional basis” that the guarantee
                    covered moneys owing on the Nassau loan. Eveleigh LJ, on the other hand, doubted
                    that the bank could have sued on the estoppel (at 126):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to appreciate that the transaction with which we are
                        concerned is the realisation of the securities by the bank. <em>We are not concerned to decide whether the plaintiffs would
                            have had a defence to an action on the A.N.P.P. guarantee itself if the
                            security had proved insufficient. For myself I do not think that the
                            bank could have succeeded in a claim on the guarantee itself</em>.
                        Estoppel operates so as to prevent a party from denying a representation or
                        an assumed state of facts in relation to the transaction supported by that
                        representation or assumed state of facts. The estoppel does not go beyond
                        the transaction in which it arose. The representation or assumed state of
                        facts are not to be held irrefutable beyond the purpose for which the
                        representation or assumption was made. In the present context the
                        representation is not made for the purpose of establishing its own truth but
                        as a part of the whole transaction. An assumption is not to be treated as
                        having the effect of an assumpsit. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Brandon LJ similarly observed (at 131):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I turn to the second argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs, that
                        the bank is here seeking to use estoppel as a sword rather than a shield,
                        and that that is something which the law of estoppel does not permit.
                        Another way in which the argument is put is that a party cannot found a
                        cause of action on an estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view much of the language used in connection with these concepts is
                        no more than a matter of semantics. Let me consider the present case and
                        suppose that the bank had brought an action against the plaintiffs before
                        they went into liquidation to recover moneys owed by A.N.P.P. to Portsoken.
                        In the statement of claim in such an action <em>the bank
                            would have pleaded the contract of loan incorporating the
                            guarantee</em>, and averred that, on the true construction of the
                        guarantee, the plaintiffs were bound to discharge the debt owed by A.N.P.P.
                        to Portsoken. <em>By their defence</em> the plaintiffs
                        would have pleaded that, on the true construction of the guarantee, the
                        plaintiffs were only bound to discharge debts owed by A.N.P.P. to the bank,
                        and not debts owed by A.N.P.P. to Portsoken. Then in their reply the bank
                        would have pleaded that, by reason of an estoppel arising from the matters
                        discussed above, the plaintiffs were precluded from questioning the
                        interpretation of the guarantee which both parties had, for the purpose of
                        the transactions between them, assumed to be true.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this way the bank, while still in form using the estoppel as a shield,
                        would in substance be founding a cause of action on it. This illustrates
                        what I would regard as the true proposition of law, that, <em>while a party cannot in terms found a cause of action on an estoppel,
                            he may, as a result of being able to rely on an estoppel, succeed on a
                            cause of action on which, without being able to rely on that estoppel,
                            he would necessarily have failed.</em> That, in my view, is, in
                        substance, the situation of the bank in the present case. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The learned authors of <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008)
                    commented at para 3-113 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Brandon L.J. seems to have taken the view that the bank could have sued on
                        the guarantee, but to have based that view on the ground that the loan
                        agreement between A and X Bank imposed an obligation on A to give the
                        guarantee: hence <em>it was that agreement, and not the
                            estoppel</em>, which would have given rise to the X Bank’s
                        cause of action, if it had sued on the guarantee. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Brandon LJ’s observations and the proposition that estoppel by
                    convention cannot be used to create a cause of action have been affirmed in
                        <em>Riverside Housing</em> (at 304) ([71] <em>supra</em>) and <em>Baird</em> (at [88])
                    ([71] <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While the use of promissory estoppel as a
                    sword has been doubted, the Singapore courts have not expressed definitively
                    whether an estoppel by convention can be used to establish a cause of action.
                    However, the court in <em>Assoland Construction Pte Ltd v Malayan
                        Credit Properties Pte</em> Ltd [1993] 2 SLR(R) 444 at
                    [40]–[41] rejected the defendant employer’s attempt to rely on
                    estoppel by convention to sue for liquidated damages, where the
                    architect’s contractual non-compliance prevented such a claim from arising
                    against the main contractor. In <em>Panwell Pte Ltd v Indian
                        Bank</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 462 (“<em>Panwell</em>”), the court also appeared to proceed on
                    the basis that an estoppel by convention destroyed the defendant’s
                    defences (<em>Panwell</em> at [62]). The plaintiff in
                        <em>Panwell</em> could rely on circumstances
                    independent of the estoppel to establish its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As such, the Plaintiff must be able to rely on
                    facts that exist independently of the estoppel to establish that it had goodwill
                    in the get-up of its Licensed Products and Licensed System. The Plaintiff did
                    not adduce evidence to show that the names of its Licensed Products acquired
                    secondary meaning. The Plaintiff was also not able to meet the high threshold of
                    showing that there were particular features in the Licensed System that were
                    capricious and that had come to be associated specifically with the
                    Plaintiff’s system. The Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to prove that
                    the elements of the Licensed System, such as self-mounting brackets,
                    audio-visual advertisements and the concept of having a store supervisor were so
                    distinctive that they were only associated with the Plaintiff in the mind of the
                    public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I thus find that the element of goodwill has
                    not been established by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Misrepresentation and Damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In light of my finding that the Plaintiff did
                    not have goodwill in the Licensed System or Licensed Products, the Plaintiff
                    fails in its claim for inverse passing off. However, for the sake of
                    completeness, I will touch briefly on the other two elements of inverse passing
                    off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Plaintiff must establish that the
                    Defendant represented the Plaintiff’s Licensed System to be the
                    Defendant’s. In <em>QB Net</em> ([44] <em>supra</em>), the court observed that the element of
                    misrepresentation would have been satisfied if the plaintiff had established
                    goodwill. It found that there were “striking similarities” in the
                    conduct of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s businesses. The defendant
                    sent letters to third parties stating that it was taking over the business of QB
                    House. It assured them that the “management and operation staff”
                    of the business will remain unchanged. The defendant’s advertisements also
                    stated that the trade name of the plaintiff’s local franchise “QB
                    House” would be changed to “EC House”. The
                    defendant’s employees informed the public that with the exception of the
                    name change, “QB House” and “EC House” were the
                    same company. Furthermore, the defendant continued to operate “QB
                    House” outlets and continued using the plaintiff’s equipment,
                    logos, uniforms, and combs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the present case, I find that the Defendant
                    arguably misrepresented the Plaintiff’s goods and services as its own on
                    termination of the 2004 Agreement. The Defendant agreed to supply retailers and
                    supermarkets in Malaysia with the Licensed Systems and Licensed Products for the
                    purposes of in-store advertising. The Plaintiff, however, alleges that the
                    Defendant had not informed the retailers in Malaysia that the Plaintiff was the
                    commercial source of the Licensed System. This appeared to be unimportant to the
                    Plaintiff while the 2004 Agreement subsisted. The Plaintiff did not insist that
                    the Defendant inform the retailers in Malaysia that the Licensed System was the
                    Plaintiff’s. Things took a turn, however, when the 2004 Agreement was
                    terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Defendant asserts that it sent letters to
                    retailers and marketers notifying them that its licence agreement with OMG Asia
                    had been terminated. It informed them that the names of the advertising media
                    would thus be changed, for example, from “Shelf Vision” to
                    “Pos Vision”. However, it should be noted that the letters were
                    only sent to the Defendant’s contracting counterparts on 21 April
                    2009. The letters also indicated that the 2004 Agreement was terminated on
                    30 June 2009 instead of 3 March 2009 and stated that “with the
                    name change all contracts with our customers and suppliers shall remain in
                    effect”. This appeared to suggest that the Defendant continued to enjoy
                    the right to provide the Licensed Products and that the Licensed Products
                    originated from it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Defendant asserts that it changed the
                    hardware for its products, such as the clips and frames used to mount the
                    advertisements onto the shelves, immediately on termination of the 2004
                    Agreement. It was not clear when the hardware was substituted, or whether the
                    Defendant informed the retailers and marketers that it was changing these
                    products because the 2004 Agreement was terminated. In any event, the Defendant
                    still adopted the use of shelf-mounted banners for its in-store advertising
                    media. The differences in the colour and mechanism of the clips does not detract
                    from this finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     On the issue of damage, no evidence of actual
                    damage was adduced by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff submitted that likelihood of
                    damage would be readily inferred where the plaintiff’s and
                    defendant’s goods and services are in competition with each other.
                    However, I find that even if misrepresentation and damage is established, the
                    inability to show goodwill in the get-up of the Licensed System and names of the
                    Licensed Products is fatal to the Plaintiff’s passing off
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I find that the Defendant has not made out any
                    defence to the Plaintiff’s claim for arrears of royalty payments. However,
                    I note that there was a period between the termination of the Master Licence
                    Agreement on 22 April 1999 and the commencement of the 2002 Agreement on
                    1 July 2002 during which the Plaintiff did not have any rights which it
                    could sub-license to the Defendant. It follows that the Plaintiff should not be
                    allowed to collect royalties for that period. As such, I order the Defendant to
                    pay the Plaintiff the outstanding royalties of RM967,753.45 less the amount for
                    the above period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The Plaintiff’s plea for an injunction
                    to restrain the Defendant from using the Licensed System or anything similar to
                    it is denied as is the Plaintiff’s plea for an injunction against the
                    Defendant with respect to passing off and use of the allegedly Cloned
                    Products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It follows that the Plaintiff’s plea for
                    an account of all revenue and profit generated from the continued use of the
                    Licensed System and/or of the Cloned Products and/or from alleged acts of
                    passing off is also dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Defendant’s counterclaim is
                    dismissed except for the declaration sought that cl 9.3 of the 2004 Agreement is
                    in restraint of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
