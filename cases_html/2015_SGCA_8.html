        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These two appeals before us arose from the
                    decision of <em>Gimpex Limited v Unity Holding Business Limited
                        and others</em> [2013] SGHC 224 (“the Judgment”) in Suit
                    No 390 of 2010 (“the Suit”). The Suit concerned a dispute
                    surrounding a contract for the sale of 41,510MT of coal by Unity Holdings
                    Business Limited (“Unity”) to Gimpex Limited
                    (“Gimpex”). The coal was to be shipped from Kalimantan, Indonesia,
                    and delivered to Karachi, Pakistan. When the coal was discharged at Karachi,
                    Gimpex had the coal tested by surveyors and discovered that it did not meet the
                    contractual specifications. Also, a request by Gimpex for a joint survey was
                    turned down by Unity. As a result, Gimpex brought a number of claims against
                    Unity and two other parties, including for breach of contract and unlawful means
                    conspiracy based on fraud. The action thus concerned the quality of the coal
                    which was delivered at Karachi and it also raised difficult issues concerning,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, admissibility of documentary
                    hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff in the Suit was Gimpex, a
                    Chennai-based trading company which has been trading in commodities and raw
                    materials since the 1950s. The representatives of Gimpex that were of particular
                    importance to the present proceedings, were one Samir Goenka
                    (“Samir”) who was the joint managing director, and one Avinash
                    Kulkarni (“Kulkarni”) who was the executive director of a
                    Singapore-incorporated subsidiary of Gimpex, SPG Mining Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant, Unity, is a company
                    incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). Unity is owned
                    by a number of shareholders, <em>ie</em>, Sainik Mining
                    (International) Ltd (“SMIL”), Classic Ventures Assets Incorporated
                    (“Classic”) and the second defendant to the Suit, Param Energy Pte
                    Ltd (“Param Energy”). SMIL owns 51% of the shares in Unity, and is
                    in turn wholly owned by Sainik Mining and Allied Services Limited
                    (“SMASL”). Classic owns 24% of the shares in Unity. Param Energy,
                    a Singapore-incorporated company, owned the remaining 25% shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The third defendant, Vinay Parmanad Hariani
                    (“Vinay”), is the sole shareholder and director of Param Energy,
                    and is also one of five directors of Unity. Vinay’s evidence was that he
                    was not very involved in dealings with Gimpex, and that he left it to three of
                    his employees, namely, Lalit Balchandani (“Lalit”), Kishore
                    Chuharmal Mahtani (‘Kishore”) and Prem Sangtani
                    (“Prem”). All these three employees were directly involved in
                    carrying out the sale of the coal, and testified in the present proceedings.
                    Another director of Unity, Dev Sindhu (“Dev”), also gave evidence
                    on behalf of the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 2009, Samir and Kulkarni were interested in
                    the coal business and were introduced to Vinay through a contact. Some
                    discussions ensued, and this led to Gimpex deciding to purchase coal from the
                    defendants. On 18 February 2010, Lalit sent a draft contract to Gimpex. In that
                    draft, Param Energy was stated as the seller of the coal. Payment for the coal
                    was to be made by a transferable letter of credit (“L/C”) in order
                    for Param Energy to use the L/C to pay its supplier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As Gimpex was not agreeable to providing a
                    transferable L/C, Lalit then asked that Unity be substituted as the contracting
                    party in place of Param Energy if no transferrable L/C was to be provided. The
                    reason for this change, as explained by Lalit, was because Param Energy did not
                    have the required banking facilities needed to pay the supplier of the coal,
                    whereas Unity had the required banking facilities and could pay the supplier
                    directly instead of through a transferable L/C. These banking facilities, on
                    clarification by Vinay during cross-examination, were actually funds provided by
                    the shareholders of Unity. Gimpex alleged that it agreed to the change of
                    contracting party on Samir’s understanding that Unity was a
                    Singapore-incorporated company when, in fact, it is a BVI-incorporated company.
                    Samir’s evidence was that he was wary of contracting with Indonesian coal
                    companies, and only wanted to do business with a Singapore-incorporated company
                    as he had a “good impression of the Singapore legal
                        system”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He alleged
                    that he had told Vinay that it gave him great comfort that Vinay was in
                    Singapore and owned a Singapore company. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He also alleged that
                    he had sought confirmation from Lalit (who replied in the affirmative) that
                    Unity was a Singapore company when the change in contracting party was proposed.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A contract for the sale of the coal was
                    eventually entered into between Gimpex and Unity on 2 March 2010 (“the
                    Contract”). The context within which the Contract was entered into by the
                    parties is particularly important in understanding the dispute. For Gimpex, it
                    did not purchase the coal for its own use. Instead, it was to on-sell the coal
                    at a marked-up price to Awan Trading Co Pvt Ltd (“Awan”), a
                    Pakistan-incorporated company, under a contract which it had earlier concluded
                    with Awan (“the Sub-contract”). As Gimpex had agreed with Awan
                    that the coal to be supplied would be of a certain quality, it was therefore
                    important that the coal to be delivered by Unity was of the requisite quality
                    which was stated in the Contract. The profit which Gimpex would make from this
                    arrangement was approximately US$80,000. At the time of the Contract,
                    Lalit’s evidence was that he knew that the Plaintiff was in need of the
                    coal in order to fulfil a sub-sale. However, Lalit neither knew the identity of
                    the sub-buyer nor the terms of the Sub-contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       From the defendants’ perspective, Unity
                    was also a middleman of sorts, in that it purchased the coal from another
                    company, PT Planet Resources (“PT Planet”) which was an
                    Indonesia-incorporated company, at a price slightly lower than the sale price
                    stated in the Contract. PT Planet was owned by Unity and Classic, and Vinay was
                    also a director of PT Planet. But PT Planet, however, was not the ultimate
                    supplier of the coal; instead, it purchased the coal from CV Berkah Mulya Abadi
                    (“Berkah”), another Indonesia-incorporated company, at an even
                    lower price. Unity stood to make a profit of 1.83% from this arrangement. Lalit
                    explained that the defendants were willing to enter into the Contract for such a
                    small profit margin in order to cultivate a long-term commercial relationship
                    with Gimpex. This was corroborated in a way by Samir’s evidence that Vinay
                    had intimated to him that the defendants wanted to do business with Gimpex in
                    relation to marble and granite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       We now come to the salient terms of the
                    Contract. The coal was to be shipped Free On Board from Kalimantan to Karachi
                    with the loading to be done between 25 March 2010 to 3 April 2010. The price of
                    the coal was US$68 per MT on the basis of it being of a certain quality,
                        <em>viz</em>, having a Gross Calorific Value on an
                    Air-Dried Basis (“GCV”) of not less than 6,300Kcal/kg and a total
                    moisture (“TM”) of 16%. The price was subject to adjustments based
                    on the quality of the coal. The Contract further provided for Gimpex to reject
                    the coal if it did not meet the minimum quality of 6,100Kcal/kg or 18% TM.
                    Payment for the coal was to be made through “an Irrevocable Single
                    restrictive Letter of Credit payable at 100% Sight”. A US$50,000
                    performance bond was also provided for by SMASL on behalf of Unity to
                    Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Central to the Contract were the terms as to
                    how the quality of the coal was to be ascertained, and this was provided for in
                    these various provisions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.1    The quality of coal to be supplied hereunder shall
                            be with the following typical specifications determined and analysed as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.4    All reported findings on all inspections/surveys

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1    Seller shall appoint Sucofindo, Indonesia to
                            determine the weight of cargo loaded onto the mother vessel at loading
                            point and issue a Certificate of Weight, which shall be final and
                            binding on both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The loading of the coal at Kalimantan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The coal was to be shipped from Kalimantan to
                    Karachi by the MV Michalakis (“the Vessel”), a ship nominated by
                    Gimpex pursuant to the Contract. During the loading of the coal from the port in
                    Kalimantan to the Vessel, PT Sucofindo (“Sucofindo”) (as provided
                    for in the Contract) was to conduct a number of tests and produce survey reports
                    which would include the quality and quantity of the coal shipped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The process of loading the coal on board the
                    Vessel and the sampling of the coal by Sucofindo during the loading process was
                    particularly crucial to the dispute. The entire process of having the coal
                    loaded on board the Vessel could be broken up into three stages: (1) delivering
                    to and stockpiling of the coal at the jetty from source; (2) loading of the coal
                    from the jetty to barges; and (3) loading of the coal from the barges onto the
                    Vessel. Sucofindo conducted a variety of sampling and testing of the coal at
                    each of these three stages. The entire process of loading the coal did not take
                    place at one location but two: 32,000MT out of the 41,510MT of coal was loaded
                    from a place known as Sungai Putting, and the remaining 9,510MT of coal was
                    loaded from Batulicin, a place quite a distance from Sungai Putting. The reason
                    for this, as alleged by Lalit, was that there were difficulties in obtaining a
                    jetty slot for the last barge to be loaded at Sungai Putting, and also because
                    there was insufficient amount of coal at Sungai Putting. Lalit’s evidence
                    was that he decided to obtain the shortfall from Batulicin even though this
                    would mean incurring more cost on his end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     During the first stage of the loading process,
                    Sucofindo conducted an analysis of the coal stockpiled at Sungai Putting. The
                    sampling took place on or about 3 April 2010, and Sucofindo produced a Report of
                    Sampling and Analysis (Certificate No 02641/GAEDAD) dated 7 April 2010
                    (“the Pre-shipment Analysis Report”). The Pre-shipment Analysis
                    Report reflected that only 32,000MT of coal was surveyed, since Sucofindo only
                    conducted sampling at Sungai Putting and not at Batulicin. This was because
                    Sucofindo could not provide any surveying services at Batulicin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the second stage of the loading process,
                    this was done from 4 to 13 April 2010 using a total of five barges. One barge
                    loaded the coal at Batulicin from 4 to 7 April 2010 and the remaining four
                    barges did so at Sungai Putting from 8 to 13 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second stage of the loading process is
                    significant because that was when the sampling of the coal for the purposes of
                    ascertaining the various parameters for quality of the coal (apart from the TM)
                    was supposed to take place. This included the GCV, which is material to the
                    dispute. The coal was loaded from the stockpiles onto a conveyor belt leading
                    onto the barges and the sampling was taken by Sucofindo when the coal was on the
                    conveyor belt. The samples taken by Sucofindo were sent for analysis and a
                    number of reports reflecting the quality and quantity of the coal loaded onto
                    each of the barges (“the Barge Reports”) were
                prepared.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     For the third stage of the loading process,
                    this was done from 11 to 21 April 2010. At this stage of the loading, samples
                    were taken primarily for the purpose of ascertaining the TM. The reason for this
                    was because the TM was especially susceptible to external elements such as
                    rainfall when the barge was travelling from the jetty to the Vessel. Apparently,
                    the journey from the jetty to the Vessel took about 24 hours. Therefore, it was
                    more accurate to test for TM using samples actually loaded onto the
                    Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the barge that was loaded at Batulicin,
                    the coal was sampled only once when it was loaded from the barge onto the
                    Vessel. As mentioned earlier, this was because Sucofindo could not do any
                    sampling when the coal was at Batulicin. A barge report was produced from the
                    samples taken, and was used to analyse all the parameters of the coal, including
                        <em>both</em> the GCV and the TM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     During the third stage of the loading process,
                    Gimpex and Awan sought to exercise what they claimed was their right to have an
                    independent survey agency to inspect and collect samples of the coal as it was
                    being loaded from the barges onto the Vessel. This was based on Arts 4.5 and 4.6
                    of the Contract (which we will set out again):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.5    At least ten (10) days prior to the 1st day of
                            load port laycan, Buyer has the option to appoint an independent
                            inspection agency of their choice. All costs for this would be borne by
                            the Buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.6    One set of raw samples drawn by the surveyors on
                            board the vessel would be duly sealed and signed by the
                            surveyors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Kulkarni’s evidence was that Gimpex
                    encountered great difficulty in doing so. In an email dated 11 April 2010, Awan
                    wrote to Kulkarni informing him that the surveyors appointed by Awan, PT
                    Surveyor Carbon Consulting Indonesia (“SCCI”), had been prevented
                    from sampling or even witnessing the sampling of the coal. Kulkarni then brought
                    this issue to the attention of Lalit and Prem. On 13 April 2010, Prem informed
                    Lalit, who relayed the message to Gimpex, that Unity would prepare samples and
                    deliver them to SCCI and that was the “maximum [they] can do”.
                    Unity’s first explanation for stopping SCCI from doing any sampling was
                    that they had caught SCCI taking coal samples of low grade which were not
                    representative of the entire cargo that was being shipped. Later, the defendants
                    changed their explanation, saying instead that Prem had stopped SCCI from
                    collecting samples because he thought that it was not allowed under the
                    Contract. When Kulkarni protested, Lalit replied stating that it was never
                    agreed between the parties that SCCI would be allowed to witness sampling of the
                    coal. Eventually, after a further exchange of emails, Lalit agreed to allow SCCI
                    to witness the <em>loading</em> of the coal onto the
                    Vessel. However, SCCI did not witness <em>sampling</em> of
                    the coal, nor <em>conduct sampling</em> of the coal
                    itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issuing of the Sucofindo Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     After the Vessel departed for Karachi,
                    Sucofindo produced a number of reports which were given to Berkah who in turn
                    passed them on to Prem. Amongst these reports was the Certificate of Sampling
                    and Analysis dated 26 April 2010 (“the Sucofindo
                Report”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Sucofindo Report indicated that there was
                    a minor deficiency in the quality of the coal which led to a price reduction
                    from US$66 per MT to US$65.6438 per MT, but nevertheless certified the coal as
                    compliant with the contractual specifications. Material to the dispute was the
                    Sucofindo Report’s analysis of the GCV and TM of the coal which were
                    stated to be 6,266Kcal/Kg and 18% respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">After the coal was discharged at Karachi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The coal arrived at Karachi on or about 8 May
                    2010, and was discharged and stockpiled in a coal yard which was under
                    Awan’s control. Awan arranged for the coal to be sampled by Intertek
                    Pakistan Pvt Ltd (“Intertek”), who issued an Inspection
                    Certification of Quality and Quantity dated 24 May 2010 (“the Intertek
                    Report”). The sampling of the coal was done by Intertek as the coal was
                    being discharged from the Vessel. Gimpex also appointed its own surveyors,
                    Inspectorate Griffith India Pvt Ltd (“Inspectorate”), who issued a
                    Certificate of Sampling and Analysis dated 30 June 2010 (“the
                    Inspectorate Report”). Inspectorate sampled the coal by extracting some
                    coal from the stockpiles at the Karachi coal yard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Intertek Report stated that the GCV was
                    5,638.86Kcal/Kg and the TM of the coal was 26.44%, while the Inspectorate Report
                    stated that the GCV was 5,255Kcal/Kg and the TM was 24.35%. These figures
                    indicated that the coal was outside the contractual specifications, and could be
                    rejected by Gimpex. Kulkarni alleged that upon discovering that the coal
                    delivered was not of the requisite quality, he tried desperately to contact
                    Lalit and Prem, but to no avail. Awan in turn rejected the coal because it was
                    not of the quality required for its use, and the coal remained at the coal
                    yard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The negotiation of the L/C</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On or about 10 May 2010, Unity presented the
                    requisite documents under the L/C for negotiation. The L/C was issued by ING
                    Vysya Bank, Chennai (“ING”) and negotiated by Bank of India,
                    Singapore (“BOI”). On or about 11 May 2010, BOI paid Unity under
                    the L/C and submitted the documents to ING for payment. Gimpex responded by
                    applying for an interim injunction on 31 May 2010 to restrain Unity from
                    receiving payment under the L/C. A similar injunction was obtained by Gimpex in
                    India on 25 May 2010 to prevent ING, the issuing bank of the L/C, from paying
                    out under the L/C. The interim injunctions were eventually discharged by consent
                    after Unity provided an undertaking not to pursue payment from
                ING.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Gimpex then called on the US$50,000
                    performance bond amounting to 2% of the contract value that had been provided by
                    SMASL under Art 7.7 of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Resale of the coal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the meanwhile, Unity sought to resell the
                    coal. The parties also began communicating with each other through their
                    respective solicitors via emails. On 17 June 2010, the solicitor’s for
                    Gimpex, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“R&amp;T”), wrote to the
                    solicitor’s for the defendants, Oon &amp; Bazul LLP
                    (“O&amp;B”) informing O&amp;B that as the coal was below the
                    contractual specifications, the ultimate buyer, Awan, had rejected the
                    coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In its reply of 18 June 2010 by way of an
                    email, O&amp;B informed R&amp;T that their client was of the view that Gimpex
                    had unlawfully rejected the coal, and that Unity would be taking steps to resell
                    it to mitigate its losses. In fact, in the meantime, on 15 June 2010, Unity had
                    entered into a contract with Rafeh Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd (“Rafeh”)
                    to sell the coal to the latter on an “as is where is” basis at a
                    price ranging from US$48 to US$68, with the actual price to be determined after
                    a survey of the quality of the coal had been carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Unity sent Kishore to Karachi to facilitate
                    the sale of the coal to Rafeh. Kishore arrived at Pakistan on 20 June 2010. The
                    next day, Kishore engaged SGS Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd (“SGS”) to
                    conduct a survey of the coal. On 22 June 2010, Kishore and SGS entered the coal
                    yard, where SGS proceeded to take samples of the coal. However, SGS was stopped
                    by Awan from taking samples. Apparently this was due to Samir informing a
                    representative of Awan that joint sampling, preferably by a reputed agency
                    appointed by the Singapore court, should be done instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Kishore alleged that later that day, he saw
                    three truckloads of coal being pilfered away by Awan, which caused him to lodge
                    a police report for theft. Kishore also claimed that he received threats on his
                    life via telephone. O&amp;B then wrote to R&amp;T on 23 June 2010, confronting
                    R&amp;T as regards the threats made to Kishore, and also the pilferage of the
                    coal. O&amp;B further questioned Gimpex’s interference with SGS’s
                    surveying of the coal, and maintained that they wanted to undertake a survey
                    immediately. R&amp;T replied on the same day in two emails. R&amp;T sought more
                    information regarding the threats made against Kishore, and explained that
                    Gimpex had stopped the SGS survey because it was concerned that the
                    defendants’ conduct of the survey might be subject to manipulation in
                    order to cover up their earlier fraudulent acts in delivering low-quality coal.
                    R&amp;T also proposed that the parties conduct a joint inspection of the coal by
                    a court-appointed agency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     O&amp;B replied the following day, on 24 June
                    2010, stating that the proposed joint inspection would be pointless as Unity was
                    of the position that Gimpex had unlawfully rejected the coal. In other words,
                    Gimpex had nothing more to do with the coal. On the other hand, Unity should be
                    allowed to mitigate its losses, and was entitled to take whatever steps it
                    deemed fit, such as conducting a survey of the coal in order that the coal could
                    be sold to another buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Kishore left Karachi on 24 June 2010, and
                    Unity eventually aborted the sale of the coal to Rafeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Subsequently, on 1 July 2010, Unity sold the
                    coal to M/s International Energy Resources (“FZC”), an associated
                    company of Awan, on an “as is where is” basis at the price of
                    US$48.63 per MT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The coal was paid for by FZC.
                    Kishore explained that the defendants had agreed to sell the coal at such a low
                    price because of the condition of the coal at that time, which they believed had
                    deteriorated due to the coal being left to lie in the open for almost two
                    months. Furthermore, they had very little control over the coal, and felt that
                    this was probably their best option at mitigating their losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the pleadings in the Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the Suit, Gimpex made a number of claims
                    against the defendants jointly or against the defendants individually:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     A claim against Unity for delivering
                        coal which did not conform to the contractual specifications, or in the
                        alternative, non-delivery of coal (“the Breach of Contract
                        Claim”). The remedies sought by Gimpex in this claim are for damages,
                        and an indemnity against any claims by Awan against Gimpex for breach of
                        contract on the part of Gimpex in failing to deliver coal of the correct
                        specifications to Awan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     A claim against Unity for payment of demurrage that was
                        due from Unity to Gimpex pursuant to the Contract (“the Demurrage
                        Claim”). This claim was based on the fact that loading of the coal at
                        Kalimantan took longer than what was provided for under the
                    Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     A claim
                        against the defendants for loss suffered as a result of an unlawful
                        conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs through unlawful and/or fraudulent means
                        (“the Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In this regard, Gimpex
                        averred that Vinay used Unity as a shell company to enter into the Contract
                        with Gimpex, knowing and intending for the coal to be of grossly inferior
                        quality, while trying to obtain payment under the L/C before the grossly
                        inferior coal was discovered. In coming up with this fraudulent scheme, the
                        defendants perpetrated the following: (1) the party to the initial draft
                        contract was Param Energy, but this was switched to Unity when Gimpex
                        entered into the Contract; (2) the defendants represented that Unity was a
                        Singapore company, and did not disclose that Unity was instead a BVI
                        company; (3) the Contract stated Unity’s domicillium as Singapore and
                        had a Singapore address; (4) the defendants fraudulently arranged for
                        grossly inferior coal to be supplied to Gimpex by procuring the coal from PT
                        Planet which was controlled by the defendants; (5) the defendants sought to
                        hide the true quality of the coal by preventing SCCI from inspecting and
                        drawing samples of the coal while it was being loaded onto the Vessel at
                        Kalimantan; and (6) Unity failed to send the required documents in
                        compliance with the L/C requirements and tendered instead a Beneficiary
                        Certificate stating that it had done so, in order to deceive and to receive
                        payment under the L/C.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     That Vinay was the alter ego of Unity and Param Energy,
                        such that the corporate veils over Unity and Param Energy should be lifted
                        with the effect that Param Energy and/or Vinay be liable for Unity’s
                        liability to Gimpex because: (1) Vinay had directed or procured the fraud
                        perpetrated against Gimpex; (2) Param Energy and/or Vinay were the true
                        parties liable for Unity’s failure to deliver the Cargo; (3) Unity was
                        merely an agent of Param Energy and/or Vinay; and (4) Param Energy and/or
                        Vinay were the true parties liable for Unity’s failure to deliver the
                        Cargo according to contractual specifications (“the Lifting of
                        Corporate Veil Claims”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the Breach of Contract Claim, Unity
                    averred that it had delivered coal that conformed to the contractual
                    specifications. This was because the Sucofindo Report reflected that that was
                    the case, and pursuant to Arts 4.4 and 5.1 of the Contract, the Sucofindo Report
                    was binding on the parties in so far as the quality and the quantity of the
                    Cargo were concerned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, Gimpex had failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate its losses
                    by not sourcing for or purchasing alternative coal to supply to
                        Awan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In addition, the defendants counterclaimed
                    against Gimpex for its alleged unlawful rejection of the Cargo and its conduct
                    following that, resulting in the defendants suffering losses, which
                    included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     Damages arising from Gimpex’s
                        unlawful rejection of the Cargo, amounting to US$643,360.02 (being the
                        difference between the Contract price of US$2,661,991.32 and the sale price
                        to FZC US$2,018,631.30), US$750 (for charges paid to SGS) and US$6,804 (for
                        the expenses incurred in the aborted sale to Rafeh).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Damages suffered by Unity arising from
                        the interim injunction obtained by Gimpex in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Reimbursement of US$50,000, being the
                        sum Gimpex received from calling on the performance bond provided under Art
                        7.7 of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     An indemnity from Gimpex for any claims arising from Rafeh for
                        Unity’s breach of the contract of sale entered into with
                    Rafeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The claims in [35] will henceforth be
                    collectively referred to as (“the Counterclaims”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For the Demurrage Claim, Unity argued that the
                    term of the Contract regarding demurrage had been varied between the parties
                    such that Unity would not be liable for any demurrage or was entitled to
                    despatch. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For the Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim, the
                    defendants argued that no representations were made to Gimpex that Unity was a
                    Singapore company, and Gimpex was not induced by any such representations to
                    enter into the Contract. They further argued that they did not commit any
                    wrongful acts against Gimpex. In any event, the defendants averred that they
                    never intended to cause injury to Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In response to the Corporate Veil Claims,
                    Vinay further denied that he was the alter ego of Unity and Param Energy. In
                    particular, Vinay pointed out that he was only one of five directors of Unity,
                    and only indirectly held 25% of the shares in Unity through Param
                Energy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Judge dismissed the Unlawful Means
                    Conspiracy Claim, the Demurrage Claims, and the Corporate Veil Claims, but
                    allowed the Breach of Contract Claim. Consequently, she dismissed the
                    Counterclaims. The Judge further ordered that damages against Unity (with the
                    question of interest on the damages together with the issue of costs of the
                    assessment) be assessed by the Registrar. She also awarded costs to Gimpex for
                    its claim against Unity and the costs of the defendants’ counterclaim, and
                    one set of costs (on a standard basis) to be awarded to Param Energy and Vinay
                    for Gimpex’s claims against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At this point we would observe that Gimpex has
                    not appealed against the dismissal of its Demurrage Claim. Therefore, we give no
                    further consideration to that claim in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings in relation to the Breach of Contract
                Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In relation to the Breach of Contract Claim,
                    the Judge’s main finding in this regard was that the coal discharged at
                    Karachi did not meet the contractual specifications, and this was in all
                    likelihood because the coal that was loaded from the jetties onto the barges was
                    not the same coal that was loaded onto the Vessel and shipped to
                Karachi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Judge held that the Sucofindo Report was
                    hearsay evidence. The defendants sought to adduce that Report via the testimony
                    of one Nonot Imam Norbintoro (“Nonot”). Nonot was an employee of
                    Sucofindo who signed some of the reports issued by Sucofindo. However, the Judge
                    found (at [160]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was clear from his evidence in cross-examination that Nonot did not
                        conduct any survey at Sungai Putting or Batulicin, he did not deliver to the
                        laboratory the coal samples that were taken by Sucofindo’s inspectors,
                        he did not conduct the laboratory tests, he was not on the barges when the
                        coal was delivered to the ship, he was not on the ship when the coal was
                        loaded and he did not prepare any certificates of Sucofindo including the
                        certificate of origin that he signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendants sought to admit the Sucofindo
                    Report under a number of the exceptions to the hearsay rule found in s 32 of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”). However, the Judge
                    rejected their arguments. The Judge held that the defendants were wrong in
                    relying on the case of <em>Toepfer v Continental Grain
                        Co</em> [1974] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 11 (“<em>Toepfer</em>”) for the proposition that the contents of the
                    Sucofindo Report could not be challenged because it was final and binding on the
                    parties under the Contract – until and unless the defendants have proved
                    the truth of the contents of the various reports issued by Sucofindo to the
                    court’s satisfaction, the Sucofindo Report could not be admitted and
                    relied on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     More importantly, the Judge also held that the
                    Sucofindo Report was not accurate and reliable, and made a number of findings to
                    that end:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the date of intervention
                        indicated in the Sucofindo Report (<em>ie</em>, the
                        date Sucofindo was involved in the shipment of the coal) was between 11 and
                        21 April 2010. Under cross-examination, Nonot admitted that the sampling
                        could not have covered the barge-loading operations as loading of the coal
                        from the jetty onto the four barges at Sungai Putting took place between 7
                        and 13 April 2010 while loading at Batulicin was between 4 and 6 April 2010.
                        The date of intervention must have been a reference to the loading of the
                        Vessel. That being the case, the Sucofindo Report did not reflect the fact
                        that the sampling of the coal for the purposes of ascertaining, <em>inter alia</em>, the GCV, was to be done when the coal
                        was being loaded from the jetty onto the barges.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the Sucofindo Report itself
                        stated that the samples were prepared and tests started on 8 April 2010, and
                        Nonot relied on this to say that the first sample was taken on 8 April 2010
                        on one of the barges such that the problems arising from the Sucofindo
                        Report concerning the date of intervention could be ignored. The Judge found
                        Nonot’s explanation unconvincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, Sucofindo had, at PT Planet’s
                        request, changed the standard wording in its certificates from “gross
                        samples were taken during loading <em>of barge</em> and
                        sample TM were taken during loading to the vessel” [emphasis added]
                        to “gross samples were collected during loading and sample TM were
                        taken during loading of the vessel”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The words
                        “of barge” were removed. This was misleading as it gave the
                        reader the wrong impression that the samples of the coal were taken while
                        the coal was being loaded onto the Vessel and that the loading was done on 8
                        April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, the Pre-shipment Analysis Report was defective as it pertained to
                        32,000MT of coal leaving a balance of 9,510MT of coal unaccounted for. The
                        stockpiles from which the coal samples were taken were also not
                        identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Judge went on to consider the
                    admissibility of the Inspectorate Report and the Intertek Report. For the
                    Inspectorate Report, one Majeed Qazi Muhammad Abdul (“Majeed”) and
                    another Mallik Shyamal Kumar (“Mallik”) were called to testify.
                    Gimpex submitted that Majeed and Mallik were the makers of the Inspectorate
                    Report and therefore the Inspectorate Report was not hearsay evidence. Majeed
                    was the operations manager of Inspection Services Incorporated (Pvt) Ltd
                    (‘ISIP”) who was the Pakistani agent of Inspectorate, and collected
                    the samples and gave evidence on that. Mallik was an assistant manager in charge
                    of carrying out the analysis of the coal samples which were carried out at
                    Inspectorate’s laboratory at Bhubaneswar, India.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In
                    cross-examination, however, Mallik admitted that he neither carried out the
                    tests on the coal himself nor visually supervised the chemists who did. He also
                    admitted that he could not confirm that the coal sampled was the coal that came
                    from the Vessel. Due to Mallik’s testimony, the Judge held that the
                    Inspectorate Report was hearsay evidence. For the Intertek Report, the Judge
                    found that the surveyors of the coal from Intertek declined to give evidence in
                    court and it was therefore hearsay evidence. The Judge then rejected
                    Gimpex’s attempts at relying on the exceptions to the hearsay rule found
                    in s 32 of the EA in order to admit both the Inspectorate Report and the
                    Intertek Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Notwithstanding that all the reports were not
                    admitted into evidence, the Judge held on a balance of probabilities the coal
                    that was discharged in Karachi was not the coal that was sampled by Sucofindo at
                    Sungai Putting. The Judge after considering the evidence held that the coal that
                    was sampled at the jetty and on the barges was not actually loaded on board the
                    Vessel. In arriving at that conclusion, the Judge made the following
                    findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     The evidence of Gimpex’s
                        expert, one Sebastian Norager (“Norager”) was preferred over
                        that of the defendants’ expert, Robert Gunn (“Gunn”).
                        This was because Norager’s report was balanced and took into
                        consideration all relevant factors and evidence while Gunn’s evidence
                        was overly biased in the defendants’ favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Norager’s evidence was that in
                        his experience, he had witnessed barges with rejected cargoes of coal being
                        towed to another ship to be loaded. In that regard, Norager noted the
                        Sucofindo Report’s analysis of the TM of the coal did not accord with
                        the fact that there was heavy rain during three of the days when the coal
                        was being loaded from the barges onto the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     Norager’s evidence was also that
                        even if he took into account the wetting of the coal by the rain, this could
                        not explain the difference in the TM shown in the Sucofindo Report, the
                        Inspectorate Report, and the Intertek Report. Furthermore, the vast
                        discrepancies in the GCV and TM of the coal shown in the Sucofindo Report,
                        the Intertek Report, and the Inspectorate Report, could not be explained to
                        be a result of the coal deteriorating in quality while being shipped on
                        board the Vessel to Karachi.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendants refused Gimpex’s suggestion of
                        conducting a joint survey of the coal at Karachi without providing a valid
                        or credible reason for the refusal. On this point, the defendants raised a
                        number of reasons for rejecting this, <em>viz</em>,
                        that it was pointless because the Sucofindo Report was final and binding as
                        to the quality of the coal, that there were threats made on Kishore’s
                        life, and that the coal was being pilfered by Awan. The Judge rejected all
                        these explanations, holding that she was sceptical regarding the threats on
                        Kishore’s life, and in any case, she did not think that those threats
                        had anything to do with conducting a joint survey of the coal. Furthermore,
                        if the defendants had really thought that the coal was being pilfered, a
                        joint survey would have been all the more necessary to determine the actual
                        quantities and quality of the coal that remained in the yard. From this, the
                        Judge inferred that the defendants knew that the coal that was discharged at
                        Karachi did not conform to the contractual
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        defendants should not have stopped SCCI from conducting sampling of the coal
                        on board the Vessel, as that was allowed under Art 4.5 of the Contract. The
                        Judge also held that the defendants’ initial explanation for stopping
                        SCCI from conducting sampling of the coal, which was that the defendants
                        were told that SCCI was sampling low quality coal, was unconvincing. This
                        was because, on Prem’s evidence, the coal would have been blended at
                        least twice by the time it was loaded onto the Vessel (<em>viz</em>, first was the loading of the coal from the jetty onto
                        the barges, and second was the loading of the coal from the barges onto the
                        Vessel) and there was therefore no possibility of SCCI only taking samples
                        of poor quality coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Judge therefore concluded that the coal
                    supplied by the defendants was not in accordance with the contractual
                    specifications. Accordingly, the Judge allowed the Breach of Contract Claim, and
                    dismissed the Counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings in relation to the conspiracy
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     First, the Judge held that Gimpex did not
                    inform any of the defendants that it required the seller of the coal to be a
                    Singapore company and also that the defendants did not represent to Gimpex that
                    Unity was a Singapore-incorporated company. In the Judge’s view, there was
                    insufficient evidence to substantiate Gimpex’s claim that it had made
                    known to the defendants that it would only enter into the transaction with a
                    Singapore-incorporated company (“the Singapore Entity
                    Claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     To substantiate the Singapore Entity Claim,
                    Gimpex made the point that when the defendants presented Gimpex with a draft of
                    the Contract, Gimpex proposed the inclusion of Art 21 of the Contract, which
                    states a Singapore address as the domicillium of Unity. The Judge, however, held
                    that none of the defendants gave much thought to Art 21 of the Contract.
                    Furthermore, the only evidence relied upon by Gimpex was Samir’s claim
                    that he had orally informed Lalit and/or Vinay that Gimpex required the seller
                    to be a Singapore company. There was no documentary evidence to that
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Judge was also not persuaded by
                    Gimpex’s reliance on Art 21 to show that the defendants represented to
                    Gimpex that Unity was a Singapore-incorporated company. First, the Judge held
                    that the word “domicillium” or “domicile” in
                    English, was simply indicative of an address nominated by a party in a legal
                    contract where legal notices could be sent, and to “equate the word
                    domicillium with a representation by [Unity] that it is a Singapore-registered
                    company is really stretching and/or straining the meaning of the word”
                    (see Judgment at [190]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Secondly, the Judge also held that it was
                    Gimpex who rejected the first draft contract where Param Energy was the
                    contracting party because Gimpex did not want to provide a transferable L/C.
                    That, as alleged by the defendants, was the only reason why Unity was
                    substituted as the seller of the coal in the Contract. The defendants did not
                    engineer the switch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thirdly, the Judge held that, “no
                    evidence was adduced in court that even remotely suggested that the third
                    defendant conspired with either the first and/or second defendant to defraud the
                    plaintiff” (see Judgment at [194]). The Judge then elaborated on this by
                    observing that Unity’s profit margin, if the transaction had gone through
                    smoothly, was only 1.83%, and therefore there was not much benefit for Vinay to
                    defraud Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings in relation to the Corporate Veil
                Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Judge held that Vinay was not the alter
                    ego of Unity or Param Energy. In particular, the Judge noted that Vinay was not
                    even a cheque signatory of Unity’s bank accounts, and the major
                    shareholder of Unity was not Vinay but SMIL, who had a 51% shareholding in Unity
                    (see Judgment at [195]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 160/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In Civil Appeal No 160 of 2013 (“CA
                    160/2013”), Gimpex has appealed against the Judge’s decision to
                    dismiss the Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim, and the Corporate Veil Claims. In
                    this appeal, Gimpex also seeks to argue that the defendants should be liable for
                    lawful means conspiracy and, that as between the defendants, there was a
                    predominant intention on their part to harm Gimpex. Thus, Vinay and Param Energy
                    should also be liable as joint tortfeasors (“the Joint Tortfeasor
                    Claim”). In addition, in respect of the Breach of Contract Claim, Gimpex
                    is asking this court to assess the damages due to it instead of letting the
                    damages be assessed later by the Registrar as ordered by the Judge as all the
                    relevant evidence relating to damages is already before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Gimpex submits that the Judge’s
                    reasoning, in relation to there being no motivation for the defendants to
                    defraud Gimpex because the profit margin under the Contract was only 1.83%, was
                    wrong. However, the remaining elements of Gimpex’s case in CA 160/2013 are
                    largely a repeat of their submissions made before the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendants did not respond to
                    Gimpex’s submission on the Judge’s finding regarding the
                    defendants’ motivation to commit fraud. The remainder of their submissions
                    was largely a repeat of their case before the Judge. They reiterated their point
                    that there was no fraud on their part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 161/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In Civil Appeal No 161 of 2013 (“CA
                    161/2013”), the defendants are appealing the Judge’s decision to
                    allow the Breach of Contract Claim and her decision to dismiss the
                    Counterclaims. Their case may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     Gimpex, as the plaintiff, had the
                        burden of proving its case that the rejection of the coal was lawful because
                        the coal did not comply with the contractual
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Sucofindo Report was final and binding on the parties pursuant to Art 4.5 of
                        the Contract. This meant that Gimpex should not be allowed to challenge
                        findings of the Sucofindo Report unless it has pleaded fraud or collusion on
                        the part of Sucofindo, or that there was a manifest error with the Sucofindo
                        Report. Gimpex did not allege fraud on the part of Sucofindo, and so the
                        defendants did not have to prove the truth of the contents of the Sucofindo
                        Report. The Sucofindo Report should have been admitted into evidence as a
                        matter of course.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any event, the Sucofindo Report should be admitted under
                            s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) and/or s
                            32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the
                    EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Sucofindo
                        Report did not contain inaccuracies as held by the Judge such that it should
                        be inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Inspectorate Report and the Intertek Report were both
                        inadmissible, or should be given little or no weight if they are admitted.
                        This is because the two reports were hearsay and were unreliable in terms of
                        accuracy. The sampling of the coal that was conducted for those reports was
                        grossly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_f"></a>(f)     There was sufficient evidence to show that the coal that was loaded
                        from the jetty to the barges was also loaded from the barges onto the
                        Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Gimpex’s response is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     Art 4.4 of the Contract did not
                        specifically provide for the Sucofindo Report to be final and binding as to
                        the quality of the coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Sucofindo Report was not admissible under
                            s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) and/or s
                            32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the EA. If it was, the
                        court should find that it is inadmissible under s 32(3) of the
                    EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Intertek
                        Report was admissible in evidence under s 32(1)(<em>j)</em>(iii) and/or s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iv)
                        of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Inspectorate Report was not hearsay evidence, and even if it were, it should
                        be admissible under s 32(1)(<em>j)</em>(iii)
                        and/or s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iv) of the
                    EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        Judge’s finding that the coal that was loaded from the jetty to the
                        barges was not the same coal that was loaded from the barges onto the
                        Vessel, should be affirmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The issues that arise for determination in
                    relation to both the appeals can be listed under the following main
                    heads:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the coal delivered at
                        Karachi was in compliance with the contractual
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the claim for conspiracy is proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the defendants are liable as joint
                        tortfeasors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the corporate veils of Unity and Param Energy should have been
                        lifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether
                        the court should have proceeded to assess the damages due to Gimpex for the
                        Breach of Contract Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the coal delivered at Karachi was in compliance with the
                contractual specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Who has the burden of showing that the Cargo supplied was within or
                outside the contractual specifications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendants submit that Gimpex, being the
                    plaintiff, has the burden of proving that the coal supplied did not comply with
                    the contractual specification. In this regard, they rely on s 103 of the EA
                    which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Burden of
                        proof</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>103.</b>—(1) Whoever desires any court to
                        give judgment as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence
                        of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said
                        that the burden of proof lies on that person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Gimpex accepts that it had the burden of
                    proving its case. However, it submits that once it has shown that it had
                    purchased coal of a specified quality from Unity under the Contract which Unity
                    had the obligation to deliver, the evidential burden would shift to the
                    defendants (or more specifically, Unity, as the seller of the coal) to show that
                    they had delivered coal within the contractual specifications. If the defendants
                    could not do so, Gimpex would have proven its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Gimpex relied on the Court of Appeal decision
                    in <em>Zim Integrated Shipping Service Ltd and others v Dafni
                        Igal and others</em> [2011] 1 SLR 862 (“<em>Zim</em>”). In that case, the plaintiffs brought claims
                    premised on the defendants’ breach of fiduciary duties, which included a
                    claim based on one of the defendants receiving monies from a third party which
                    was to be accounted for to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs adduced evidence to
                    the effect that the defendant received monies which corresponded in value to the
                    amounts which were owed by the third party. The defendant’s response,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, was that the monies paid to him
                    were gratuitous incentive payments given to it for its support and patronage of
                    the third party. The Court of Appeal held (at [12]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, although the [plaintiffs] bore the legal burden throughout of
                        proving that the monies were received in connection with the [defendant's]
                        role as the [plaintiffs’] agent (and, hence, establishing their legal
                        entitlement to the [monies]), they had … in fact discharged the
                        (initial) evidential burden that this was the case. The evidential burden
                        then shifted, at this point, to the Fourth Respondent to demonstrate that
                        the monies had not been received in that capacity (see also, in relation to
                        the distinction between the legal burden and the evidential burden, the
                        decision of this court in <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo
                            Chay Loo, deceased</em> [2010] 1 SLR 286 (at [14])).
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As a matter of principle, the defendants are
                    correct to say that it is for Gimpex to prove its case and that Gimpex bears the
                    legal burden throughout. In order for Gimpex to satisfy that legal burden, it
                    must prove three things: (1) what it was entitled to under the contract; (2)
                    what was in fact delivered; and (3) what was delivered did not comply with what
                    it was entitled to. Gimpex’s submission appears to be that so long as it
                    can show (1), the burden would then shift onto the defendant to prove that it
                    did ship conforming coal. The problem with this analysis is that it reverses the
                    burden of proof that is placed on Gimpex by s 103 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The case of <em>Zim</em>
                    relied upon by Gimpex also does not help them. That was a case concerning a
                    claim against fiduciaries. The plaintiffs’ case in <em>Zim</em> was that: (1) they were supposed to receive certain sums of
                    moneys from third parties; (2) those moneys were paid to one of the defendants;
                    and (3) that defendant did not pay over those moneys to the plaintiffs. The
                    Court of Appeal found that the plaintiffs had discharged their initial burden of
                    proving their case. The evidential burden thus shifted over to that defendant to
                    demonstrate that the monies had not been received by him in his capacity as a
                    fiduciary and clearly, only the defendant would be able to answer in what other
                    capacity, if at all, he was receiving the payment. Those were different
                    circumstances. Here Gimpex has not discharge its initial burden of proving the
                    second and the third elements set out in [64] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In this connection, the same must be said
                    about the defendants’ counterclaim for unlawful rejection. In order for
                    the defendants to succeed in their counterclaim, they must show that: (1) there
                    was a contract for Gimpex to take delivery of the coal in exchange for payment
                    to the defendants; (2) the coal delivered to Gimpex was of the quality specified
                    under the Contract; and (3) Gimpex did not accept delivery of the
                coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     What follows from this analysis is that in
                    order for Gimpex to succeed, it must show that either the Intertek Report or the
                    Inspectorate Report is admissible into evidence in order to discharge its
                    initial burden that the coal delivered was deficient. Only then would the
                    evidential burden shift to the defendants, who seek to admit the Sucofindo
                    Report as countervailing evidence as to the quality of the coal delivered.
                    Similarly, as regards the Counterclaim, it is for the defendants to first show
                    that the coal delivered was of a satisfactory quality. To do that, they must
                    show that the Sucofindo Report is admissible into evidence and is reliable. Only
                    when the defendants have proved that, would the evidential burden shift to
                    Gimpex. Where neither party is able to discharge its initial burden, then both
                    parties will equally fail in their claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Breach of Contract Claim and the
                    Counterclaims therefore heavily hinge upon the admissibility of the three
                    reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Sucofindo Report was final and binding on the quality of
                the coal such that the truth of its contents need not be proven by the
                defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Before analysing the admissibility of the
                    three reports proper, we pause here to consider a submission made by the
                    defendants in relation to the Sucofindo Report. The defendants contend that
                    under Art 4.4 of the Contract, parties had agreed that the Sucofindo Report
                    shall be final and binding on the parties as to the quality of the coal. We will
                    refer to Art 4.4 again:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.4    All reported findings on all inspections/surveys
                            conducted at Origin in relation to quality, quantity and weights etc
                            done at origin and/or port and place of loading shall be FINAL and
                            binding to both Buyer and Seller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Furthermore, Art 4.1 provides that the quality
                    of the coal shipped was to be determined and analysed by Sucofindo, while Art
                    4.3 expressly states that the “consignment should be accompanied by
                    Certificate of Sampling and Analysis as per ASTM standard issued by Sucofindo
                    Indonesia” (<em>ie</em>, the Sucofindo Report). Thus
                    the defendants say that having the Sucofindo Report to be regarded as final and
                    binding as to quality of the coal was consistent with the commercial purpose of
                    such a clause, which was to minimise disputes about the quality of the
                    coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Gimpex, on the other hand, contends that Art
                    4.4 makes no specific mention of a quality certificate issued by Sucofindo, and
                    refers instead to findings in general. Gimpex contrasted Art 4.4 with Art 5.1,
                    which is a provision in the Contract relating to ascertaining the <em>quantity</em> of coal. Art 5.1 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1    Seller shall appoint Sucofindo, Indonesia to
                            determine the weight of cargo loaded onto the mother vessel at loading
                            point and issue a Certificate of Weight, which shall be final and
                            binding on both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Gimpex argues that if the parties had intended the Sucofindo
                        Report to be final and binding as to quality, they would have said so
                        expressly in a manner similar to that in Art 5.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In addition, Gimpex relies on Art 4.5, which
                    allows the buyer to appoint an independent inspection agency, and Art 4.6, which
                    provides that one set of raw samples drawn by surveyors on board the Vessel
                    should be duly sealed and signed by “the surveyors”. Gimpex argues
                    that by virtue of these provisions, the Contract appears to envisage that
                    Sucofindo’s analysis of the coal was to be checked by another inspection
                    agency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendants’ response is that SCCI
                    was only allowed to witness the loading of the coal under Art 4.5. This is
                    because if SCCI was allowed to sample the coal, this would run contrary to Arts
                    4.1 and 4.4 that the Sucofindo Report was meant to be final and binding as to
                    quality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We agree that reading Art 4.4 in isolation
                    could leave one in doubt as to its proper sense. It is true that read in the
                    context of the preceding provisions (see [10] above), and that must be the
                    proper way to construe the provision, Art 4.4 would, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, mean that the parties have agreed to regard the
                    reports/findings of Sucofindo, including those as to quality, as being final and
                    binding on them. That said, we must point out that there are difficulties to the
                    above construction by virtue of Arts 4.5 and 4.6, with the former providing that
                    the buyer has the option of appointing “an independent inspection
                    agency” and the latter stating that “one set of raw samples drawn
                    by the surveyors on board the vessel would be duly sealed and signed by the
                    surveyors”. What would be the role of the surveyor appointed by the buyer
                    (here, it was SCCI)? There is nothing in Art 4.5 which indicates that SCCI could
                    only witness what was being done by Sucofindo so why could SCCI not collect
                    samples? Moreover, there must be a purpose in requiring that the samples taken
                    on board the vessel be “duly sealed and signed by the surveyors”.
                    Should the sealed samples also bear the signature of the surveyor (SCCI)
                    appointed by the buyer? And if the samples taken need only bear the signature of
                    the surveyor appointed by the seller (in this case Sucofindo), what would be the
                    point of Art 4.6? The position is far from clear. We would also highlight that
                    Art 22 of the Contract even provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">BUYER’S at their own expense shall reserve the right at any time to
                        observe or appoint an observer/representative/third party international
                        inspection agency during mining and stockpiling of the coal for the
                        shipment, sampling and analysis, loading and weighing at the
                        stockpile/jetty/loading port/anchorage for which SELLER’S to extend
                        all necessary cooperation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the light of Arts 4.5 and 4.6, we do not think a
                        certificate issued by Sucofindo as to the quality of the coal should be
                        regarded as final and binding on the parties. Here, Gimpex did appoint SCCI
                        as its own independent inspection agency in accordance with its entitlement
                        to do so under the Contract. It follows, and also bearing in mind that any
                        ambiguity in the Contract could possibly be construed <em>contra proferentem</em> vis-à-vis the drafter (in this case, the
                        defendants) that the defendants should not be permitted to insist that the
                        Sucofindo Report was final and binding between the parties as to the quality
                        of the coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     What this means is that if the defendants are
                    to rely on the Sucofindo Report as proof of the quality of the coal, the
                    defendants must prove the truth of the contents of the Sucofindo Report. It is
                    to this issue which we now turn our attention to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The admissibility of the Sucofindo Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As alluded to earlier, the admissibility of
                    the three reports are crucial to the present case. We first examine the
                    admissibility of the Sucofindo Report, followed by the admissibility of the
                    Intertek Report and finally the Inspectorate Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The parties have placed much reliance on s 32
                    of the EA and we will begin with looking at the significant amendments to s 32
                    brought about by the Evidence (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 4 of 2012) (“the
                    EA(A) 2012”). The objects of the amendments to s 32 of the EA were
                    summarised at the Second Reading of the Evidence (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (14 February 2012) vol 88)
                    (“the <em>Parliamentary Debates</em>”) by
                    Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The hearsay rule provides that an out-of-court statement shall
                        not be admitted as proof of its contents, unless the maker of the statement
                        is produced in Court. The rule has been much criticised and exceptions have
                        been carved out. Strong views have been expressed to us that the hearsay
                        rule should be abolished. The present amendments, however, do not go that
                        far. There is still a core of sense – common sense
                            - in the hearsay rule that, <em>prima facie</em>, a statement should not be admitted to prove the
                        truth of its contents if its maker cannot be cross-examined as to its
                        veracity. What we have done is to introduce more flexible exceptions to the
                        hearsay rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 32 is amended, so that the exceptions in that section will no
                        longer be predicated on the unavailability of the maker. The business
                        records exception in section 32(b) is extended. Existing exceptions under
                        the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 will now be moved to the Evidence Act; they
                        will now apply to both civil and criminal proceedings. The Court is given a
                        residual discretion to exclude hearsay evidence in the interests of justice.
                        This ensures that the expanded exceptions are not abused. This is in
                        addition to the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to exclude prejudicial
                        evidence. A party who intends to rely on hearsay evidence would also have to
                        give advance notice of his intent, in accordance with the relevant rules of
                        procedure.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the Sucofindo Report hearsay evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendants rely on the Sucofindo Report in
                    order to prove that <em>the coal shipped on board the Vessel and
                        discharged at Karachi</em> had a GCV of 6,266Kcal/Kg and TM of 18%,
                    and was therefore within the contractual specifications. That is the fact in
                    issue which the defendants are seeking to prove by the Sucofindo
                Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The defendants submit that the Sucofindo
                    Report is admissible as proof of that fact in issue through Nonot’s oral
                    testimony, whom the defendants alleged was the maker of the report. The
                    Sucofindo Report was therefore not hearsay evidence, or in other words, the
                    statements contained in the report are not just statements of relevant facts
                    which are admissible under s 32(1) of the EA (see <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447 at
                [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The defendants’ submission that Nonot
                    was the maker of the Sucofindo Report is premised on a legal proposition they
                    seek to advance, namely, that the person who authenticates the document is the
                    maker of the document. The defendants rely on the Kuala Lumpur High Court case
                    of <em>Public Prosecutor v Abdul Rahim Bin Abdul Satar</em>
                    [1990] 3 MLJ 188 (“<em>Satar</em>”) where
                    objection was taken as to the admissibility of a list bearing the serial numbers
                    of some dollar notes on the basis that it was hearsay evidence. The list was
                    used for the purposes of showing that the accused person had received those bank
                    notes in contravention of the then Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 (Act 57)
                    (M’sia). An issue arose as to who was the maker of the list since the
                    investigating officer who produced this list in court had received the list from
                    another police officer who prepared the list. However, the investigating officer
                    had compared the numbers on the prepared list with the bank notes and found that
                    the notes correlated to the numbers on the list. He was also the person who
                    signed off on the list as the person who passed the notes to the accused. Wan
                    Yahya J held that the investigating officer was the maker of the list
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… By comparing the unsigned list against the notes and then signing
                        the same, the [investigating officer] had in effect authenticated and
                        endorsed the [list] as his own document. After all <em>he was
                            the person who compared the notes and could vouch for the correctness of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mere deed of composing, framing, ascribing, or preparing a document or
                        reducing certain details into writing, does not ipso facto turn the writer

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On that basis, the court held that the list was not hearsay
                        evidence and was admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The defendants relied on the underlined
                    portion of the quotation above in support of the proposition advanced. However,
                    this reliance is misconceived. That statement was made in the context of the
                    court determining that the maker of the list was the investigating officer
                        <em>and not</em> the police officer who prepared it.
                    Instead, the crucial part of the court’s decision was the first italicised
                    portions of the quotation above. The reason why the maker of the list was the
                    investigating officer was because he had checked the numbers on the list against
                    the actual bank notes and could thus testify as to the truth of the numbers
                    inscribed on the list as matching the bank notes he passed on to the accused
                    person. The other police officer who prepared and gave the list to the
                    investigating officer was no more than someone who did the clerical
                work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The position in the present case is different
                    from <em>Satar</em> in all material respects. Factually, it
                    was not clear that Nonot was the person who signed the Sucofindo Report. During
                    examination-in-chief, Nonot testified that the only certificate he signed on
                    Sucofindo’s behalf was the certificate of origin, and the rest of the
                    certificates (including the Sucofindo Report) were signed by one M Eko Supriana.
                    The Judge also held that this was the case. This is a direct contradiction to
                    the defendants’ submission that, “[i]t is not disputed that Nonot
                    signed [the Sucofindo Report]”, and that the Judge had erred in that
                    regard. Gimpex unequivocally denies that this issue is undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In any event, Nonot’s evidence during
                    cross-examination was that he was not personally involved in the entire process
                    of sampling, testing, and loading of the coal: (1) he did not conduct the
                    sampling of the coal at Sungai Putting or Batulicin; (2) he did not deliver the
                    coal samples to the laboratory for testing; (3) he did not conduct the
                    laboratory tests; (4) he did not witness the coal being loaded onto the barges;
                    (5) he did not witness the coal being loaded on the Vessel from the barges; and
                    (6) he did not prepare the Sucofindo Report (or any of the various Sucofindo
                    certificates issued). His involvement was restricted to giving instructions to
                    the Sucofindo personnel during sampling, calling to check that the coal samples
                    arrived at the laboratory in Batulicin, being informed of the test results,
                    obtaining updates on the loading process from the Sucofindo personnel involved,
                    and checking the Sucofindo Report against time sheets provided by the Sucofindo
                    personnel who had collected the samples. In other words, he could not testify as
                    to whether the statements contained in the Sucofindo Report about the quality of
                    the coal shipped on board the Vessel and discharged at Karachi were true –
                    he had no first-hand knowledge at all. This is unlike what the investigating
                    officer did in <em>Satar</em> who in fact checked the
                    numbers on the list against the actual bank notes. Therefore, the Sucofindo
                    Report is hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ reliance on s 32(1)(b)(iv)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Next, the defendants’ argue that the
                    Sucofindo Report is admissible under s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) of the EA. In their submissions, the defendants rely
                    principally on two things: (1) the amendments to s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) in 2012, where it was made clear that the statements made
                    pursuant to s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) included statements made
                    based on information supplied by other persons; and (2) the High Court decision
                    of <em>Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Translink Exhibition
                        Forwarding Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 712 (“<em>Press Automation</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Turning first to <em>Press
                        Automation</em>, the issue there was whether a survey report which
                    incorporated a verbal inspection report was admissible without the person who
                    made the verbal inspection report being called to testify. The plaintiff there
                    relied, <em>inter alia</em>, on the previous s
                        32(1)(<em>b</em>) in the EA (“the old s
                        32(1)(<em>b</em>)”), which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>32. Statements, written or
                            verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be

                            cases:</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course

                            or in the discharge of professional duty, or of an acknowledgment
                            written or signed by him of the receipt of money goods, securities or
                            property of any kind, or of a document used in commerce, written or
                            signed by him, or of the date of a letter or other document usually
                            dated, written or signed by him;...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Judith Prakash J held that because the verbal
                    inspection report was made in the ordinary course of business and the making of
                    the survey report was done as part of the maker’s ordinary duties, the
                    report should be admissible pursuant to the old s 32(1)(<em>b</em>). Prakash J further held that the survey report was admissible
                    for another reason. The defendant there had waived its right to object to the
                    admissibility of the survey report by agreeing that it should be included as
                    part of the Agreed Bundle without making any reservations on admissibility, with
                    the effect that the report would be admissible without formal
                proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The defendants submit that the circumstances
                    surrounding the admission of the Sucofindo Report were similar to that in
                        <em>Press Automation</em>. Here, Nonot testified that
                    he had verified the sampling and analysis process with the Sucofindo survey and
                    laboratory personnel. The sampling of the coal and the testing of the samples
                    were done in the ordinary course of business, and the making of the Sucofindo
                    Report was done as part of Nonot’s ordinary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     On the other hand, Gimpex submits that the
                    Court of Appeal decision in <em>Vaynar Suppiah &amp; Sons v Abdul
                        Rahim K M A and Another</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 112
                        (“<em>Vaynar</em>”) held that the old s
                        32(1)(<em>b</em>) only applied to: (1) reports made in
                    the course of business which were prepared first-hand by a person with knowledge
                    of the truth of the contents of the report; and (2) only to statements of facts
                    made by experts in the course of business and not to statements of opinion. In
                    so far as <em>Press Automation</em> is contrary to the
                    holdings in <em>Vaynar</em>, it ought not to be accepted,
                    since <em>Press Automation</em> was a High Court decision
                    which did not consider the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Vaynar</em>. Furthermore, Gimpex submitted that the Sucofindo Report
                    consisted of statements of opinion, and that in making the Report Nonot did not
                    have personal knowledge of the information required to give those opinions
                    stated in the Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Be that as it may, the cases above were
                    decided under the previous version of s 32, which does not concern us here. The
                    current s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) expressly includes,
                    “a statement made in a document that is, or forms part of, a record
                    compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business,
                    profession or other occupation <em>based on information supplied
                        by other persons</em>” [emphasis added]. It would appear that
                    Gimpex’s objection that the Sucofindo Report was made by a person without
                    personal knowledge of the information required to make the report can no longer
                    hold good in light of the current provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It was clear from the Explanatory Statement to
                    the Bill which eventually was enacted as EA(A) 2012 that s 32 was amended,
                    “to expand the scope of existing exceptions, <em>especially the exception for statements made in the course of a trade,
                        business, profession or other occupation</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. We should add that the expansion of the scope of s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) was also discussed in greater detail in the Ministry
                    of Law draft consultation paper in relation to the Bill (“the
                    Consultation Paper”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As background, the Consultation Paper noted
                    (at p 8) that the Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <em>Report of the Law Reform Committee on Reform of Admissibility of
                        Hearsay Evidence in Civil Proceedings</em> (May 2007) at para 15
                    (Chairman: Philip Jeyaretnam SC) (“the <em>Law Reform
                        Committee Report</em>”) critiqued the old s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) for being limited in the following ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     The exception is confined to
                        first-hand reports made by the transactor himself. It does not apply to
                        business records compiled by a third-party record keeper from information
                        supplied by a transactor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     It is unclear whether the exception applies to composite
                        business reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     As applied to expert reports, the exception is limited to statements
                        of fact (as opposed to opinion) made by the experts in the course of
                        business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Consultation Paper stated
                        that the intention of the draft Bill was to (at pp 8–9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>remove these technical limitations to the scope of the
                            “business statement” exception</em>, and to allow a
                        court the discretion to admit all business records produced in the ordinary
                        course of business which appear prima facie authentic (see section
                            32(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Draft Bill). … It
                        would remain open to the party against whom such evidence is raised to
                        challenge the weight which should be attributed to such evidence. Further,
                        the court’s discretion to decline to admit such hearsay evidence would
                        also apply to business statements. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It is also apposite to note that the
                    limitations of the old s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) as mentioned in
                    the <em>Law Reform Committee Report</em>, were made with
                    reference to the decision in <em>Vaynar</em> (see the
                        <em>Law Reform Committee Report</em> at para 15). In
                    fact, that report stated that the position on the admissibility of
                    “composite business reports” was still unclear despite the
                    decision of <em>Press Automation</em> (<em>ibid</em>). There is, therefore, cause to believe that the scope of
                    the current s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) is meant to remove the
                    limitations under the old law set out in <em>Vaynar</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     We would observe that s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) appears to be a new sub-provision which was not
                    there in the old s 32(1)(<em>b</em>). However, on the
                    face of it, s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) does not purport to
                    alter the scope of the admissibility of business documents apart from making it
                    absolutely clear that business records would also fall within the exception to
                    the hearsay rule. This is evidenced by the <em>Parliamentary
                        Debate</em> on the Bill (see above at [76]) where the Minister had
                    expressly stated that, “[t]he business records exception in section 32(b)
                        [<em>sic</em>] is extended”. However, the real
                    extension of the scope of this exception to the hearsay rule would appear to lie
                    in the last phrase of s 32(1)(<em>b</em>), “based on
                    information supplied by other persons”, which qualifies all
                    sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of s 32(1)(<em>b</em>). This
                    phrase is commented on by Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC (“Prof
                    Pinsler”) in his work, <em>Evidence and the Litigation
                        Process</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) (“<em>Pinsler</em>”), in the context of s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv), as follows (at para 6.008):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term ‘record’ is not defined in the EA. It may consist of
                        a single document which includes information or two or more documents which
                        contain information. In any event, it must be compiled by a person in the
                        ordinary course of his trade, business, profession or other occupation.
                            <em>There is no express requirement that the compiler and
                            the persons who supplied the information included in the record must
                            have personal knowledge of that information.</em> Therefore, s
                        32(1)(b)(iv) is broader than the repealed s 272 of the current CPC (and its
                        predecessor, s 380 of the former CPC), which required the supplier of
                        information to have, or to be reasonably supposed to have had, personal
                        knowledge concerning the facts. Moreover, where the supplier of information
                        was merely an intermediary (as when he received information from another
                        supplier of information, who might have been an intermediary himself), the
                        intermediary or intermediaries had to have been acting under a duty.
                            <em>The absence of these requirements in s 32(1)(b)(iv)
                            means that hearsay upon hearsay (multiple hearsay) to an unlimited
                            degree may be admitted without safeguards concerning the knowledge of
                            the persons involved in transmitting the information.</em>
                        Furthermore, the condition in the repealed s 272 that direct oral evidence
                        of the facts would have been admissible (ie, the court could have accepted
                        direct testimony of the facts if it had been available) is also absent from
                        s 32(1)(b)(iv). Additionally, the protection in the repealed s 272, which
                        precluded the admissibility of a statement in the record if the person who
                        supplied the information did so after the commencement of investigations
                        into the offence, has not been retained by s 32(1)(b)(iv). <em>These omissions raise the real possibility that documentary
                            records admitted under s 32(1)(b)(iv) may be unreliable</em>, a
                        particular concern where the accused has to face such evidence in criminal
                        proceedings. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In the premises, we are of the view that the
                    current s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) is <em>prima
                        facie</em> broad enough to permit the admission of the Sucofindo
                    Report for the purposes of proving that the coal shipped on board the Vessel and
                    discharged at Karachi was of the quality stated in the report. However, this is
                    not the end of the matter. There is still s 32(3) which requires the court to
                    examine whether it should exercise its discretion to exclude the Sucofindo
                    Report in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants’ reliance on s 32(1)(j)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     But before we consider how s 32(3) should be
                    construed and applied, it may be convenient for us to deal briefly with the
                    parties submissions on the admissibility of the Sucofindo Report based on
                        s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the EA, which is an
                    exception to the hearsay rule where the maker of the statement “is
                    outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance”. We
                    should add that s 32(1)(<em>j</em>) is a new addition to
                    the EA pursuant to the EA(A) 2012. As explained in <em>Pinsler</em> (at paras 6.028–6.029):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Section 32(1)(<em>j</em>)] is different
                        from paras (a)–(h) of the section in two main respects. First, its
                        operation does not depend on a specific factual scenario as in the case of
                        the latter paragraphs. Second, its underlying principle is that the
                        witness’s statement is the best evidence available in the face of his
                        unavailability. In contrast, the availability of the maker as a witness is
                        not an issue for the purpose of admissibility pursuant to paras
                        (a)–(h) of s 32(1). As the only requirement for admissibility under s
                        32(1)(j) is the unavailability of the maker of the statement as a witness,
                        it is essential that the ground put forward by the party seeking to admit
                        the statement is strictly proved by him. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.029 Whether the ground of unavailability relied upon
                            is satisfied must depend on the particular facts of the case.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In light of the nature of s 32(1)(<em>j</em>), we agree with the views of Prof Pinsler that the
                    burden is on the person seeking to rely on s 32(1)(<em>j</em>) to prove the ground of unavailability and that a mere
                    allegation of unavailability is not acceptable. This follows as a matter of
                    reason and logic. This was also the position under the old s 32(1), where the
                    unavailability of a witness was one of the conditions which had to be fulfilled
                    before any of the exceptions contained within the old s 32 could even be engaged
                    (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Jet Holdings
                        Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other
                        appeals</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769; and <em>Asia Hotel
                        Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd and
                        Another</em> [2007] SGHC 50). In the present case, it is therefore
                    incumbent on the defendants to prove that they were entitled to invoke s
                        32(1)(<em>j</em>) to admit the Sucofindo
                Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     As to what the defendants need to show in
                    order to invoke s 32(1)(j), a plain reading of the provision reveals that there
                    are two cumulative requirements: (1) that the witness is outside Singapore; and
                    (2) that it is not practicable to secure his attendance. The first requirement
                    is obvious in itself. The second requirement is less straightforward, in the
                    sense that what is “practicable” is open to interpretation and
                    would depend on the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     On the second requirement, Prof Colin Tapper
                    (“Prof Tapper”) in <em>Cross and Tapper on
                        Evidence</em> (LexisNexis, 12th Ed, 2010) observed with regard to
                    s 116(2)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c 44) (UK) (“the
                    CJA”) (which is <em>in pari materia</em> to
                        s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the EA) (at p 607)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The second condition, however, refers not to inability to attend,
                        but to <em>secure</em> attendance, and may be satisfied
                        by the recalcitrance of a witness outside the United Kingdom. Reasonable
                        practicality implies assessing the likely effectiveness of taking normal
                        steps to secure the attendance of the witness, and considering in relation
                        to such a judgment the importance of the evidence, the degree of prejudice
                        to the defence if it is admitted, and the expense and inconvenience involved
                        in securing attendance. … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The defendants’ submissions also
                    referred, in reliance on the case of <em>R v Castillo</em>
                    [1996] 1 Cr App Rep 438 (which concerned the previous incarnation of s 116(2)(c)
                    of the CJA), to these various considerations alluded to by Prof Tapper. They
                    averred that 30 surveyors were involved in the survey project. They were from
                    Indonesia, and it would not have been reasonably practicable to have them
                    testify at the trial. Furthermore, the surveyors would not have been able to
                    provide any useful testimony on Gimpex’s pleaded case that the coal
                    sampled by Sucofindo was not shipped on board the Vessel and was not the coal
                    that was discharged in Karachi. In addition, Unity had requested for the contact
                    details of these 30 surveyors but was informed by Sucofindo that most of them
                    had resigned and were no longer contactable. The defendants submit that the fact
                    that the witness in question has left the employ of the party seeking to admit
                    the evidence, is a factor that points to it being impracticable for the witness
                    to be produced (see the English High Court decision of <em>Elafonissos Fishing and Shipping Company v Aigaion Insurance Company
                        SA</em> [2012] EWHC 1512 (Comm) at [5]). Finally, the defendants also
                    stated that they had in their Notice to Admit Documentary Hearsay Evidence dated
                    29 April 2013 (“the defendants’ Notice to Admit”) set out
                    the names of 27 of the surveyors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    We make a number of observations with regard
                    the defendants’ submissions. First, the defendants appear to have failed
                    to place sufficient importance on the testimony of the surveyors in admitting
                    the Sucofindo Report for the purpose of showing that the coal shipped on board
                    the Vessel and discharged at Karachi was of the requisite quality. The evidence
                    of how the coal was sampled was crucial in determining whether the Sucofindo
                    Report was accurate as to the quality of the coal which the defendants alleged
                    was shipped on board the Vessel and discharged at Karachi. It is a critical
                    piece of document for the present action. Secondly, while we agree that the
                    witnesses having resigned from Sucofindo is a relevant factor to consider, this
                    does not necessarily suggest that they are no longer contactable. Evidence as to
                    how they were previously contacted and what efforts had been made to contact
                    them would have been more germane. Thirdly, while we appreciate that this may be
                    a result of loose drafting, to say that the witnesses were from Indonesia is
                    equivocal. The issue is whether the witnesses are outside Singapore; where they
                    came from is irrelevant. Lastly, the setting out of the names of the surveyors
                    in the defendants’ Notice to Admit would not overcome the deficiencies of
                    the defendants’ case. The setting out of the names was but a procedural
                        <em>requirement</em> under s 32(4)(b) and O 38 r 4 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of
                    Court”), which the defendants had to comply with in order to even attempt
                    to adduce hearsay evidence under s 32 and this will be further analysed below at
                    [135]–[141].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Given that the burden was on the defendants
                    to prove their case for admissibility of the Sucofindo Report under s
                        32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii), and in light of the inadequate
                    evidence adduced in that regard, we find that the Sucofindo Report should not be
                    admitted pursuant to s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii). However,
                    given our earlier findings as regards s 32(1)(<em>b</em>)(iv) (see [81] to [91] above), our holding here is not
                    determinative of the admissibility of the Sucofindo Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 32(3) of the EA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The fact that a document is admissible under
                    s 32(1) of the EA is not the end of the matter. Section 32(3) of the EA must
                    also be considered; it reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A statement which is otherwise relevant under subsection (1) shall not be
                        relevant if the court is of the view that it would not be in the interests
                        of justice to treat it as relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The purpose of s 32(3) as understood from the Minister’s
                        speech in the <em>Parliamentary Debates</em> appears to
                        be a balancing counter to the potential increase in the admission of hearsay
                        evidence due to the amendments made in the EA(A) 2012, which (as mentioned
                        earlier at [77]) were enacted to “introduce more flexible
                        exceptions”, while giving the courts a “residual discretion to
                        exclude hearsay evidence in the interests of
                justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In this regard, the application of s 32(3)
                    must be considered especially for evidence admitted pursuant to s
                        32(1)(<em>b</em>), the scope of which was expressly
                    stated by the Minister to have been expanded (see above at [91]). The expanded
                    scope dispenses with the requirements under the previous s 32(1)(<em>b</em>) for the maker of the statement to have personal
                    knowledge of the facts contained in the statement and that the direct oral
                    evidence of the facts must have been admissible, and therefore “raise the
                    possibility that documentary records admitted under s 32(1)(b)(iv) may be
                    unreliable” (see <em>Pinsler</em> at para
                    6.008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Prof Pinsler in “Admissibility and
                    the Discretion to Exclude Evidence: In Search of a Systematic Approach”
                    (2013) 25 SAcLJ 215 (“<em>Pinsler
                    (SAcLJ)</em>”), analysed the theoretical basis of s 32(3) of
                    the EA, and helpfully proposed the following (at para 30):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the word “relevant” is used in the EA to express the
                        admissibility of a fact, it must be assumed that this is the meaning
                        intended by [s 32(3)]. It is clear that [s 32(3) confers] upon the court a
                        discretion to exclude the hearsay statement … if its admissibility
                        would not be in the interests of justice. The terminology does raise
                        conceptual and practical concerns. First as s 5 of the EA (which is the sole
                        pillar of the admissibility scheme) declares the admissibility of the facts
                        set out in [s 32(1)], their status is established once and for all. By
                        empowering the courts to reverse their status (by deciding that the
                        statement … “shall not be relevant”), [s 32(3)] creates
                        a legal fiction to the effect that those facts were never relevant
                        (admissible) or somehow lost their relevancy (status of admissibility)
                        pursuant to the court’s discretion. The second point is related to the
                        first. One must assume that the provisions of the EA … were drafted
                        with a view to the interests of justice. Therefore, as a matter of
                        principle, how is it that the court should be entitled to decide that the
                        admissibility of facts within the scope of [s 32(1)] would not be in the
                        interests of justice? <em>The real issue here is not whether
                            the status of admissible evidence might somehow be converted to
                            inadmissible evidence at the pleasure of the court, but whether
                            admissible evidence (its status as admissible evidence does not change)
                            should nevertheless be excluded because of other countervailing factors
                            that outweigh or override its value (its benefit to the process of
                            adjudication) to the case</em>. While the effect of the exclusion
                        of admissible evidence would be the same as if it had been regarded as
                        inadmissible, the distinction between the two approaches is vital to the
                        balancing operation just referred to. Moreover, in exercising its discretion
                        to exclude admissible evidence as opposed to reversing the effect of s 5 of
                        the EA, the court would not interfere with the scheme of admissibility of
                        the EA. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We agree with Prof Pinsler’s view that the issue in
                        applying s 32(3) is whether admissible evidence should be excluded
                        because other countervailing factors outweigh the benefit of the having the
                        evidence admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The considerations to be taken into account by the
                court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Turning now to the question of the
                    application of s 32(3), we note that Prof Pinsler (in <em>Pinsler</em> at para 6.052), observed that, “[i]t is
                    immediately noticeable that there are no criteria to guide the court” as
                    to how s 32(3) ought to be applied. He then suggested some factors which the
                    court could take into consideration in determining whether a relevant statement
                    should nevertheless be excluded under s 32(3) (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ideally, the court would balance the significance of the evidence (its
                        probative value or importance to one or more of the issues) against any
                        factors that militate against its admission. That is, the admissible
                        evidence may be excluded if it does not justify the disadvantages that would
                        result from its admission. Such disadvantage would include the danger of
                        unreliability or other harm which might compromise fair adjudication,
                        additional costs (as when a hearsay statement is not necessary because it
                        essentially duplicates other evidence in the case), delay in the proceedings
                        (where additional time is needed to adduce the evidence or the proceedings
                        have to be postponed), the distraction of the court and/or the parties
                        (where the evidence raises collateral issues that require undue attention),
                        its tendency to confuse or its misleading effect (as when there are doubts
                        about authenticity and good faith), lack of reliability (where the
                        circumstances of the author of a statement or in which the statement was
                        made raise concerns about its truthfulness) and prejudice (in the sense of
                        evidence that would have the effect of being substantively unjust or
                        procedurally oppressive). It seems to be clear that the less significant or
                        probative the statement, the less forceful the countervailing factors would
                        need to be to justify exclusion. Nevertheless, as the evidence is declared
                        to be admissible by s 32(1) of the EA, the court should not normally
                        exercise its discretion to exclude the statement unless the countervailing
                        factors clearly outweigh the benefit that would be gained by its
                        admission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Prof Pinsler in <em>Pinsler
                        (SAcLJ)</em> further opined that the terminology of “in the
                    interest of justice” used in s 32(3) was broad, and it would therefore
                    “be of considerable assistance to the court if ss 32(3) … were to
                    include a list of considerations that (the court) might take into account in
                    determining whether to exercise its discretion to exclude” (at para 31).
                    He then proceeded to note that this was the approach taken in a number of
                    jurisdictions such as the United States of America (see r 403 of the Federal
                    Rules of Evidence (2015)), Australia (see s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Act No
                    2 of 1995 (Cth)), and the United Kingdom (see s 126(1) and s 114(2) of the
                    CJA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    We are largely in agreement with Prof
                    Pinsler’s suggestions, and also accept that the factors which he set out
                    (see [103] above) are germane and appropriate as a <em>general</em> basis from which the court may go about its analysis
                    when deciding whether to exercise its discretion to exclude otherwise admissible
                    evidence pursuant to s 32(3) of the EA. Indeed, the factors he set out are based
                    on good sense, having due regard to the purposes of admitting hearsay evidence
                    in order to promote the objectives of the trial process. They are of a
                    sufficient level of generality that could be applicable to the different
                    circumstances that could arise on the particular facts of each case, although we
                    supplement this with a caution that it is not necessary that all the factors
                        <em>must</em> be considered in each case; the myriad of
                    possible fact circumstances would throw up situations where only some of the
                    factors may be relevant, but where relevant, those factors should be taken into
                    account by the court when exercising its discretion under s 32(3). In addition,
                    we note that the factors were largely consonant with the list of considerations
                    found in the various foreign jurisdictions referred to in the preceding
                    paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In particular, we think that where the
                    hearsay evidence sought to be admitted is of limited probative value, such
                    evidence should properly be excluded. The effect of this is that the party
                    seeking the admission of the hearsay evidence must be able to show the court
                    that there were certain safeguards or measures that applied to that evidence
                    which would ensure a minimal degree of reliability. Of course, the court in
                    doing so must bear in mind the fine line between a decision not to admit hearsay
                    evidence (under s 32(3)) and a decision to admit the hearsay evidence but
                    to accord it less weight (under s 32(5)). The court should not normally exercise
                    its discretion to exclude evidence that is declared to be admissible by the
                    EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    For completeness, we observe that Prof
                    Pinsler in <em>Pinsler (SAcLJ)</em> has commented that
                    s 32(3) does not distinguish between criminal and civil proceedings. Whilst
                    this is not material to the appeals before us, we note that the learned
                    author’s view in that regard has a degree of merit, and should constitute
                    one of the considerations for a court to take into account in exercising its
                    discretion under s 32(3). However, we will leave a definitive ruling on this
                    specific issue to the next case that requires a definitive ruling on
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The considerations applied to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It is not in doubt that the Sucofindo Report
                    had very significant importance for the defendants’ case in relation to
                    the fact in issue, namely, whether the quality of the coal loaded onto the
                    Vessel and shipped to Karachi met the contractual specifications. Weighed
                    against that, as submitted by Gimpex, is the fact that the Sucofindo Report was
                    unreliable, and had the tendency to confuse or mislead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Gimpex relies on the Judge’s findings
                    that the Sucofindo Report was not accurate and reliable (see above at [45] and
                    on the Judge’s finding that the coal that was sampled at the jetty and on
                    the barges was not actually loaded onto the Vessel (see above at [47]). This
                    meant that even if the Sucofindo Report reflected the true quality of the coal
                    that was sampled when loaded from the jetty to the barges, this was irrelevant
                    to the issue of the quality of the coal that was loaded onto the
                Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Judge’s findings on the reliability of the
                Sucofindo Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The defendants challenge the Judge’s
                    findings that the Sucofindo Report was not accurate and reliable. The
                    Judge’s first and second findings (see [43] above) show that the Sucofindo
                    Report was not clear whether it covered the sampling of the coal when the coal
                    was being loaded from the jetty onto the barges. The defendants sought to
                    construe the Sucofindo Report using various methods of interpretation to try to
                    persuade us that the date of intervention covered the dates when the coal was
                    being loaded from the barges onto the Vessel. However, this was not the
                    Judge’s point. Her issue with the Sucofindo Report was that it was simply
                        <em>prima facie</em> misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Those findings were closely related to the
                    Judge’s third finding, that the Sucofindo Report was misleading because of
                    the deliberate removal of the words “of barge”, which gave the
                    reader the wrong impression that the samples of the coal were taken while the
                    coal was being loaded onto the Vessel and that this loading was done on 8 April
                    2010. Nevertheless, the defendants argue that the Sucofindo Report could not
                    have been misleading, at least in so far as Gimpex and Awan were concerned. This
                    was because the sampling of the coal at the second and third stage of loading
                    was explained in an email from Nonot to Awan, which Awan then forwarded to
                    Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    However, it is this same email which
                    justifies the Judge’s finding that the removal of the words “of
                    barge” from the Sucofindo Report was misleading. After Nonot had
                    explained the sampling process to Awan, he proceeded to mention that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We also put information that sample “Gross sample were taken during
                        barge loading” at our draft Certificate of Sampling Analysis which I
                        sent to your shipper last night (draft certificate attached) since we are
                        taken sample during loading to the barge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Bad English aside, this shows that Nonot himself recognised
                        that it was important to make clear that sampling was done while the coal
                        was being loaded onto the barges. This contradicted Nonot’s attempted
                        explanation that the removal of the two words “of barges” did
                        not change the meaning in the Sucofindo Report. It is also pertinent to note
                        that Nonot removed the two words at the request of the
                        “shipper”. With the benefit of much explanation, it is now
                        apparent that sampling of the coal did take place during loading of the
                        barges. But what all these show is that Sucofindo was all too willing to
                        make alterations to its report at the request of the defendants (who
                        obviously wanted the change because it suited them) without regard to what
                        was the true position. Moreover, the confusion as to the dates on the
                        Sucofindo Report (see [45] above) shows sloppiness on the part of Sucofindo
                        in its preparation. It is also not clear whether the results obtained were
                        the results of analysis of the samples obtained while the coal was being
                        loaded from the jetty onto the barges or of the samples taken while the coal
                        was being loaded from the barges onto the vessel or were they the results of
                        the combination of both categories of samples. All these questions go
                        towards showing the unreliability of the Sucofindo Report. As the Contract
                        envisaged that the report was binding on the parties to some extent, it is
                        vital that it should be prepared with care to ensure reliability. This was
                        obviously missing in the Sucofindo Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    A related point concerned the Judge’s
                    finding that the coal that was sampled at Sungai Putting and on the barges was
                    not actually loaded onto the Vessel. Given that one possible way of challenging
                    the probative value of the Sucofindo Report in proving the quality of the coal
                    shipped on board the Vessel and discharged at Karachi was to show that the coal
                    that was tested by Sucofindo at Sungai Putting was not the same coal that was
                    loaded onto the Vessel, we understand why the defendants wanted to have the
                    words “of barge” deleted from the Sucofindo Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The Judge’s finding that the coal loaded onto the
                barges was not the coal loaded onto the Vessel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Moving on to the issue of whether the coal
                    loaded onto the barges was the coal that was being loaded onto the Vessel, the
                    defendants did not quite address what is, in our view, the Judge’s most
                    important reason for answering that issue in the negative. The Judge accepted
                    Norager’s evidence that the value for the TM in the Sucofindo Report of
                    18% was suspicious. Norager had calculated the weighted average TM of the coal
                    in the five barges based on the various Barge Reports to be 19%. This was 1%
                    above the figure of 18% in the Sucofindo Report. This discrepancy was even more
                    surprising given the fact that there were at least five stoppages due to rain
                    during the loading of the coal from the barges onto the Vessel. In particular,
                    Norager’s view was that the TM of the coal loaded from Batulicin was too
                    low because there were at least three stoppages due to heavy rains during the
                    time of loading of the coal onto the barges at Batulicin which commenced on 4
                    April 2010. If anything, the TM should have been higher than 19%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The defendants’ expert, Gunn, also
                    calculated the TM of the coal to be 19% based on the Barge Reports. He explained
                    that the 1% difference was not significant and could have been caused when the
                    coal at Sungai Putting was being loaded from the jetty to the barges via
                    conveyor belt and exposed to more rainfall. Norager’s response was that a
                    difference of 1% of TM was not insignificant because the difference in weight of
                    the coal on account of that 1% of moisture would be 415MT (or
                        415m<sup>3</sup> of water). Moreover, he felt that the
                    effect of the exposure on the conveyor belt was overstated because that also
                    meant that the coal on the conveyor had more exposure to the sun as well. We
                    also note that Gunn’s explanations did not explain why the TM stated in
                    the Sucofindo Certificate did not reflect the heavy rain during the loading of
                    the coal onto the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    There are of course two possible
                    explanations as to why the coal loaded from the jetty onto the barges was not
                    the same coal that was loaded from the barges onto the Vessel. One is that the
                    defendants fraudulently swapped the barges with other barges containing low
                    quality coal, and the other is that by an accident or misfortune, the coal on
                    wrong barges was inadvertently loaded onto the Vessel. However, regardless of
                    which might be the true cause, the fact of the matter is that the coal which was
                    sampled by Sucofindo at Sungai Putting might not be the same coal that was
                    loaded onto the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    For these reasons, we find that the
                    Sucofindo Report had serious issues concerning its reliability. The defendants
                    have not managed to produce evidence that sufficiently assures us that there is
                    a minimal degree of reliability in the Sucofindo Report. We therefore find it in
                    the interest of justice not to admit the Sucofindo Report into evidence pursuant
                    to s 32(3) of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Again, for completeness, we ought to mention
                    that the Judge had noted certain circumstances which suggested that the
                    defendants had something to hide in relation to the quality of the coal loaded
                    onto the Vessel. These included her scepticism concerning why the defendants
                    refused Gimpex’s proposal to conduct a joint inspection of the coal, and
                    why Unity (besides being in breach of the Contract) disallowed SCCI to witness
                    the sampling of the coal. We share the Judge’s concerns and will address
                    these issues more fully in a moment when analysing the Unlawful Means Conspiracy
                    Claim (see [170]–[173] and [181]–[182] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The admissibility of the Intertek Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Gimpex relies on the Intertek Report in
                    order to show that <em>the coal delivered</em> to it had a
                    GCV of 5,638.86Kcal/Kg and a TM of 26.44% and was therefore outside of the
                    contractual specifications. Accordingly, Gimpex was within its rights to reject
                    the delivery of the coal as provided for under Art 6 of the
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The Intertek Report was adduced by the
                    affidavit of Mr Balagurusamy Nagamania Pillai Shakara Subramaniam
                    (“Shankar”), the legal manager of Gimpex. However, the people
                    involved in the sampling, testing, and preparation of the Intertek Report,
                        (<em>ie</em>, those who could prove the truth of the
                    statements in the Intertek Report regarding the quality of the coal), did not
                    testify. It was undisputed that the Intertek Report was hearsay evidence and
                    Gimpex sought to admit the Intertek Report under s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) and/or s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iv)
                    of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Gimpex’s reliance on s 32(1)(j)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In his affidavit, Shankar explained that the
                    Intertek personnel involved in sampling and testing the Cargo were unwilling to
                    testify in court. At the trial, counsel for Gimpex, Philip Tay (“Mr
                    Tay”), also produced an email which includes a statement from the
                    Intertek Director and Chief Executive Officer, Shahid Salim, explaining why
                    Intertek was not willing to give evidence before a Singapore court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Some
                    of the reasons given were that Intertek was not commissioned by Gimpex to
                    conduct the survey and report; that it was Intertek’s policy and code of
                    conduct not to “disburse the report to anyone but the nominating
                    company/person”; and that it was not Intertek’s policy to side a
                    party in a lawsuit or appear as an expert witness for that party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    It appears that the Judge could have
                    overlooked this email when she held that there was no evidence to “show
                    what steps [Gimpex] had taken to persuade the surveyor in question to come to
                    Singapore to testify at this trial” (see [206] of the GD), and she
                    decided not to admit the Intertek Report under s 32(1)(<em>j</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Apart from the email itself, there was also
                    some evidence in relation to this issue given by Shankar at trial. In
                    cross-examination, Shankar was asked whether he contacted Awan “to
                    request that [Awan] speak to Intertek and ask Intertek to appear in this Court
                    to give evidence”. Shankar’s reply appeared to be no, but this was
                    not clear on the face of the transcripts of the hearing. Later on in
                    re-examination, Mr Tay followed up on that question, by asking why Shankar did
                    not ask Awan to request Intertek to come and give evidence. Shankar’s
                    evidence was that this was because “Awan rejected the cargo”, and
                    then later stated that he could not remember. Mr Tay pressed Shankar on this
                    point, and asked Shankar why the fact that Awan rejected the cargo would stop
                    him from asking Awan to ask Intertek to come to Singapore. At that point in
                    time, Shankar’s answer was that there was no specific reason, and he
                    simply contacted Intertek. In addition, Shankar gave evidence that he had
                    followed up on the attempt to ask Intertek to give evidence in Singapore by
                    talking to them, but his attempts were rebuffed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In our view, the email produced by Gimpex,
                    and the evidence given by Shankar at the trial, was evidence of Gimpex’s
                    attempts at procuring the attendance of the witnesses at trial, and the
                    witnesses refusing its request. We find that this is sufficient for the Intertek
                    Report to be admitted under s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iv) of
                    the EA given that the current scheme of admissibility of hearsay evidence under
                    the EA envisages a broader scope for admissibility which is balanced by the
                    exclusionary discretion of such evidence under s 32(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of s 32(3) and s 32(5) of the EA to the Intertek
                Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The defendants submit that the Intertek
                    Report was so unreliable that its admission should be excluded pursuant to s
                    32(3), or if not, little weight should be given to it pursuant to s 32(5). We
                    note that at trial, the Intertek Report was not challenged by the defendants
                    with expert evidence. However, the defendants now argue that the number of
                    samples of coal taken by Intertek for analysis was grossly inadequate. The
                    Intertek Report indicates that only 55 samples of coal were taken by Intertek in
                    coming up with that report as compared with the ASTM sampling standards which
                    prescribe a minimum of 225 samples for 41,510MT of coal. Norager’s
                    evidence under cross-examination was also that a minimum number of 226 samples
                    should be taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    On balance, taking into account the
                    considerations that we have stated earlier (at [103]), we do not think that this
                    rendered the Intertek Report <em>so unreliable</em> that
                    the court should exclude it under s 32(3). While we felt that more could have
                    been done to procure Intertek’s cooperation to give evidence, there was
                    perhaps a limit to what Gimpex could do. Shankar’s evidence was not the
                    most illuminating, but the sense of it is that Gimpex had tried their level best
                    to get Intertek to come forward to give evidence. If anything, the main
                    criticism against Gimpex was that it should have obtained the help of Awan in
                    getting Intertek to give evidence. Shankar’s explanation for not doing so
                    was that Awan had rejected the coal. Implicit in this answer was the suggestion
                    that Awan would not want to have anything to do with the dispute between the
                    parties anymore. This could well have been the case seeing that FZC (an
                    associate company of Awan) eventually purchased the coal discharged at Karachi
                    from the defendants at a much lower price (see [32] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Bearing in mind what we have stated earlier
                    (at [108]) that the court should carefully consider whether evidence should not
                    be admitted under s 32(3) or should be admitted under s 32(5) but accorded less
                    weight, we are of the view that the Intertek Report, unlike the Sucofindo
                    Report, was not so deficient that it should be excluded pursuant to s 32(3). The
                    fact of the matter is that, in so far as the Intertek Report is concerned, apart
                    from there being an inadequate number of samples taken in producing the Intertek
                    Report, there was no other complaint that could be raised against it. Indeed,
                    that was the only challenge against the Intertek Report’s reliability
                    raised by the defendants. The Intertek Report did not suffer from the same
                    defects as those of the Sucofindo Report. There was no proof or, indeed, any
                    allegation that the Intertek Report was tampered with and neither did the
                    defendants take issue with the fact that the coal discharged at Karachi was not
                    the coal that was sampled in preparing the Intertek Report. All in all, the
                    countervailing factors against the admission of the Intertek Report do not
                    clearly outweigh the benefit that would be gained by its
                admission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    However, we note that s 32(5) of the EA
                    requires the court to assign the appropriate weight to the evidence admitted
                    under s 32(1). In light of the fact that the sampling size for the coal should
                    have been significantly more than what was indicated in the Intertek Report, we
                    hold that the Intertek Report should be accorded less weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The admissibility of the Inspectorate Report</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was it hearsay evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Like the Intertek Report, Gimpex also relies
                    on the Inspectorate Report in order to prove that the <em>coal
                        delivered</em> to it was outside of the contractual specifications,
                    such that it was lawful for Gimpex to reject delivery of the goods as provided
                    for under Art 6 of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Gimpex submits that the Inspectorate Report
                    was not hearsay evidence as Majeed and Mallik had direct knowledge of the
                    samples and tests and were the makers of the Inspectorate Report. Gimpex further
                    juxtaposed the situation of the Inspectorate Report with that of the Sucofindo
                    Report, and Nonot’s evidence, in that regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    However, this does not cure the defect in
                    Mallik’s evidence as was found by the Judge. Mallik’s evidence was
                    that he neither carried out the tests on the coal himself nor visually
                    supervised the chemists who did. He also could not confirm that the coal sampled
                    in the laboratory he was in charge of came from the Vessel. We therefore affirm
                    the Judge’s finding that the Inspectorate Report was hearsay
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The requirement for notification</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    As mentioned earlier at [76]–[78], an
                    additional safeguard is prescribed in s 32(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    (in light of the expanded scope of the admission of hearsay evidence under s
                    32), requiring a party who wishes to admit hearsay evidence under s 32(1) (apart
                    from s 32(1)(<em>k</em>)), to give notice of this to the
                    opposing party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Section 32(4)(<em>b</em>) is to be read with O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court, which sets
                    out the procedure and the prescribed form for the notice, the details of which
                    are not material in these appeals. What is not as clear but is important for the
                    present purposes is the consequence of a failure to give notice under O 38
                    r 4, as the latter is silent on it. Gimpex only fulfilled the notice
                    requirements to admit the Intertek Report but not the Inspectorate Report. We
                    observe that this issue was not raised at all by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    As a matter of plain construction, it must
                    follow that non-compliance with O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court would mean that s
                    32(4) of the EA is not satisfied, such that “evidence <em>may not be given</em> under [s 32(1)]” [emphasis added]. Of
                    course, that is not to say that the non-compliance with O 38 r 4 cannot be cured
                    subsequently. This also appears to be the view of Professor Pinsler (in
                        <em>Pinsler</em> at para 6.046) who stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… No doubt, a party can apply for an extension of time pursuant to
                        [O 3 r 4] and to cure an irregularity under [O 2].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The more difficult question is when and
                    under what circumstances should a court exercise its discretion to cure such
                    non-compliance. It seems to us that this is ultimately a question much dependant
                    on the extent to which the non-compliance causes prejudice to the opposing party
                    which would render it unfair for the hearsay evidence to be admitted. As stated
                    in <em>Pinsler</em> (at para 6.042):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of notice is to enable the opposing party to carry out his own
                        investigation prior to the trial in order to ascertain its significance and
                        veracity and to secure information which may refute it or reduce its weight
                        (if necessary). The right of the opposing party to notice should be
                        considered in conjunction with the procedures under s 32C, which permit him
                        to adduce evidence concerning the credibility of the maker of the statement
                        (and the original supplier of information under s 32(1)(b)) and the
                        reliability of the statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The curing of any irregularity and/or
                    non-compliance with O 38 r 4 must also be considered in light of the
                    court’s discretion pursuant to s 32(3) to exclude evidence otherwise
                    admissible under s 32(1). The various considerations as set out above (at [106])
                    must be taken into account where appropriate, and again, the issue of prejudice
                    to the opposing party will inevitably surface (see also <em>Pinsler</em> at para 6.046).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    We have noted the manner in which Gimpex had
                    conducted its case in the trial below, and it was clear to us that they took the
                    position that the Inspectorate Report was not hearsay evidence, it having been
                    adduced through the evidence of Majeed and Mallik. We recognise that it would
                    have been more prudent for Gimpex to have given the notice as an alternative
                    position just in case the court does not agree with its primary
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Be that as it may, it is difficult to see
                    how the defendants were prejudiced by this lack of notice. The defendants had
                    indeed challenged the evidence of Majeed and Mallik to the extent of showing
                    that they had no personal knowledge of some of the facts contained in the
                    Inspectorate Report that Gimpex sought to rely on to prove that the coal
                    discharged at Karachi did not meet the contractual specifications. They took
                    full advantage to discredit the reliability of that report and sought to
                    convince the court of the same. When one looks at the position of the
                    Inspectorate Report and compares it with the Intertek report (where proper
                    notice was given), the defendants in fact had a better opportunity to demolish
                    the Inspectorate Report than the Intertek Report because Majeeb and Mallik were
                    available for cross-examination by the defendants. All considered, we think this
                    is an appropriate instance for us to exercise our discretion under O 2 to cure
                    the non-compliance by Gimpex of O 38 r 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    That being the case, we proceed to examine
                    whether the Inspectorate Report can be admitted under the relevant provisos in s
                    32(1) relied on by Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is the Inspectorate Report admissible under s 32(1)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Gimpex’s submission was that the
                    Inspectorate Report should be admissible under s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) or (iv) of the EA because it had sought the attendance
                    of the relevant surveyors and laboratory personnel to give evidence in court as
                    evidenced by Shankar’s affidavit. There seems to be some confusion or a
                    mistake here. Shankar’s affidavit related only to the Intertek Report.
                    There was also no evidence suggesting that Gimpex had sought the attendance of
                    the persons who could supplement the testimony of Majeed and Mallik in order to
                    prove the truth of the contents of the Inspectorate Report; and neither was
                    there any evidence who those people might be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    We accept that parties might sometimes be
                    faced with the problem of having evidence they seek to adduce be adjudged as
                    hearsay evidence notwithstanding their best endeavours at procuring what they
                    believe to be the necessary witnesses to come forth and testify. In such
                    situations, parties might be left hanging when the ruling as to whether the
                    evidence is hearsay goes against them. Parties should therefore be alive to any
                    such objections that may be raised by their opponents, and should then consider
                    carefully whether the hearsay evidence they wish to admit falls within the scope
                    of s 32(1), and if so, under which proviso of s 32(1). Parties must be prepared
                    with the necessary evidence to satisfy the court to admit the hearsay evidence
                    under the relevant proviso of s 32(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Gimpex, however, was not so prepared. It
                    failed to satisfy the court that the Inspectorate Report fell within s
                        32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) or s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iv) simply because there was no evidence to that effect. We
                    therefore find that the Inspectorate Report is inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the coal delivered to Karachi within the contractual
                specifications?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Since the Intertek Report is admitted into
                    evidence, only with less weight to be accorded to it, we find that Gimpex has
                    discharged the initial burden of proving its case. The evidential burden would
                    thus shift over to the defendants. Since the Sucofindo Report is not admitted
                    into evidence, we find that the defendants have not managed to satisfy their
                    evidential burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In this connection, it also follows that the
                    defendants have failed to prove their counterclaim against Gimpex as they have
                    not discharged their burden of showing that the coal delivered at Karachi was of
                    the quality specified under the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Accordingly, we dismiss the
                    defendants’ appeal in CA 161/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim for conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    We now turn to consider the Unlawful Means
                    Conspiracy Claim which was dismissed by the Judge. In CA 160/2013, Gimpex is
                    seeking to appeal that decision, while attempting to put forward an alternative
                    claim in lawful means conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The elements to constitute unlawful and
                    lawful means conspiracy are set out in <em>Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and
                        others</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 (at [23]) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_150-p2_a"></a>(a)     A combination of two or more
                        persons and an agreement between and amongst them to do certain
                    acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_150-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the
                        conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of the
                        conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff. However, if
                        the conspiracy involves unlawful means, then such predominant intention is

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In order to prove the Unlawful Means
                    Conspiracy Claims, Gimpex needs to show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendants committed fraud on
                        Gimpex; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was an agreement between Unity, Param Energy and Vinay to do so;

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_c"></a>(c)     damage was
                        suffered by Gimpex as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the defendants commit fraud on Gimpex?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    To establish fraud, it must be clearly
                    pleaded and proved. Gimpex’s case was that Vinay used Unity as a shell
                    company to enter into the Contract with Gimpex, knowing and intending for the
                    Cargo to be of a grossly inferior quality, while trying to obtain payment under
                    the L/C before the grossly inferior coal was discovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The following are the sub-issues which need
                    to be addressed in relation to Gimpex’s case for fraud:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was the Judge’s reason for
                        not finding fraud because the defendants would gain little to defraud Gimpex
                        as Unity’s profit margin, if the transaction had gone through
                        smoothly, was only 1.83%, wrong?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did Gimpex make known to the defendants that it only
                        wanted to deal with a Singapore-incorporated company?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_c"></a>(c)     Did the defendants represent to
                        Gimpex that Unity was a Singapore company?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_d"></a>(d)     Was Unity, a shell company, substituted to
                        replace Param Energy as the contracting party at the last
                    minute?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_e"></a>(e)     Did the
                        defendants know that the coal was of an inferior quality and thus rejected
                        the request of Gimpex for joint inspection of the coal which was discharged
                        at Karachi?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_f"></a>(f)     Did the defendants sell the coal to FZC at a low price because they knew
                        that the coal was of an inferior quality?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_g"></a>(g)     Did the defendants fraudulently arrange with PT
                        Planet, an entity controlled by the defendants, to supply sub-quality coal
                        to Gimpex?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_154-p2_h"></a>(h)     Did
                        the defendants seek to hide the true quality of the coal by disallowing SCCI
                        from inspecting and drawing samples of the coal while it was being loaded
                        onto the Vessel?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    We will deal with each sub-issue <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Judge’s finding that there was not much benefit
                for the defendants to defraud Gimpex as Unity’s profit margin was only
                1.83%</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    One of the reasons why the Judge found that
                    there was no fraud was because “[Unity]’s profit margin would only
                    have been 1.83% if the transaction had gone [through] smoothly (which evidence
                    [Gimpex] did not challenge)”. There was therefore little incentive for
                    Vinay to defraud Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    With respect, the Judge’s finding on
                    this point is not correct. If the quality of the coal discharged at Karachi was
                    actually much inferior to what was contracted for, then the price which the
                    defendants would have to pay for the same would also be much lower. Based on the
                    evidence of Gimpex’s expert witness, Liang Yun, whose affidavit evidence
                    was not challenged at trial, the price of the quality of coal discharged at
                    Karachi would be in the range of US$38 per MT to US$44 per MT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Taking the
                    median price of US$41 per MT compared to the contract price of US$66 per
                    MT, the profit margin would have been US$25 per MT, which would amount to
                    US$1,037,500 for 41,510MT of coal. Thus the profit margin for Vinay in
                    defrauding Gimpex would actually be 37.87%, a sufficient incentive indeed. This
                    means that the defendants would stand to earn 2,000% more than what they would
                    have gained if no fraud was perpetrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Did Gimpex make it known to the defendants that it only
                wanted to deal with a Singapore-incorporated company?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The Judge’s finding was that Gimpex
                    did not make known to the defendants that it only wanted to deal with a
                    Singapore-incorporated company. While Gimpex disputed this finding of the Judge,
                    it sought to downplay the importance of this finding by arguing that whether
                    they made such an intention known to the defendants is immaterial to their
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Having considered the evidence, we affirm
                    the Judge’s finding of fact (see above at [50]) in this regard. We agree
                    with the Judge that the mere inclusion of Art 21 into the Contract, which stated
                    a Singapore address as the domicillium of Unity, would not amount to a
                    substantiation of Gimpex’s assertion that they had made known to
                    Lalit/Vinay that Gimpex only wanted to deal with a Singapore-incorporated
                    company. There is nothing to prove this apart from what was barely stated in
                    Samir’s affidavit evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    In addition, we would also clarify that
                    Gimpex’s submission that this finding was immaterial to its case is not
                    correct. Gimpex’s case is that the defendants made Unity out to be a
                    Singapore-incorporated company in order to defraud Gimpex. However, unless
                    Gimpex had actually made known its intention to the defendants that it would
                    only deal with a Singapore-incorporated company, there would have been no need
                    for the defendants to have tried to masquerade Unity as a Singapore-incorporated
                    company as alleged by Gimpex. Without such an intention being made known by
                    Gimpex to the defendants, all that the defendants needed to do to defraud Gimpex
                    would have been to ensure that whichever corporate entity used by the defendants
                    to enter into the Contract with Gimpex was a separate legal entity that was
                    devoid of assets so that there could not be any enforcement against that
                    corporate entity in substance. The only possible reason why the defendants would
                    make it seem as if Unity was a Singapore-incorporated company, which is
                    Gimpex’s case for fraud, must be because Gimpex had made known to the
                    defendants that it only wanted to deal with a Singapore-incorporated
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Did the defendants represent that Unity was a Singapore
                company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The Judge found that there was not enough
                    evidence to suggest that the defendants had indeed represented to Gimpex that
                    Unity was a Singapore company. Gimpex was relying on Samir’s evidence that
                    that was what was told to him by the defendants. Gimpex also relied on the
                    various references to Singapore found in the Contract, including the choice of
                    law and jurisdiction clauses which referred to Singapore law and the Singapore
                    courts respectively. Gimpex also pointed to the fact that in the Contract,
                    Unity’s address was stated to be “33 Ubi Avenue 3 #07-12, Tower
                    “B” Vertex, Singapore 408868”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The defendants’ response was that the
                    Singapore address in the Contract was only for ease of communication and nothing
                    more. They unsurprisingly aligned themselves with the Judge, and submitted that
                    they never intended to represent to Gimpex that Unity was a
                    Singapore-incorporated company. We would further add that the fact that the
                    Contract is subject to Singapore law as well as the jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore courts is neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Having considered the evidence and the
                    arguments of the parties, we do not think that there is a sufficient basis for
                    this court to disturb the finding of the Judge on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether Unity is a shell company and was it substituted in
                place of Param Energy as the contracting party at the last minute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    There are two elements to this point. The
                    first relates to Gimpex’s allegation that Unity is a shell company, with
                    the effect that it had no assets for Gimpex to enforce against should Gimpex
                    succeed against Unity in its claims. It is undisputed that Unity is a BVI
                    company. It is also admitted by Vinay that Unity had no employees in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    However, the evidence adduced by various
                    witnesses for the defendants is that Unity has a substantial paid-up capital of
                    US$8,213,750. Gimpex sought to challenge this in cross-examination of Dev, and
                    one Ajay Kumar (“Ajay”), who was an employee of SMASL and was
                    involved in the payment of the coal from PT Planet to Berkah. Ajay’s
                    evidence was that around US$7m of Unity’s paid-up capital was invested in
                    shares in PT Planet. Unity owned 99% of the shares in PT Planet, with the
                    remaining 1% being owned by Classic (which was itself a 24% shareholder of
                    Unity). The money was then used by PT Planet to acquire some mines in
                    Kalimantan. Dev’s evidence was that Unity would be paid dividends by PT
                    Planet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Gimpex challenged this evidence by
                    suggesting to Dev that since the mines were owned by PT Planet, any judgment
                    debt could not be enforced against the mines themselves. This is not disputed.
                    However, Gimpex seems to have missed the point. Even if Unity did not own the
                    mines directly and the mines are owned by PT Planet, then as a 99% shareholder
                    of PT Planet, it would mean, in a loose sense, that the mines are very much
                    owned by Unity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Therefore, we do not think that Unity was a
                    shell company such that any enforcement of a judgment debt against it would be
                    pointless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The second element of this submission is
                    that Unity was swapped to replace Param Energy as the contracting party at the
                    last minute as part of the fraud perpetrated by the defendants on Gimpex.
                    However, as found by the Judge, it was Gimpex (and not the defendants) who
                    rejected the first draft contract where Param Energy was to be the contracting
                    party. The reason for Gimpex’s rejection was because they did not want to
                    provide a transferable L/C. But this was entirely up to Gimpex. If Gimpex did
                    not reject the draft contract in the first place, Param Energy would not have
                    been substituted by Unity. There was also no evidence that the defendants
                    somehow knew that Gimpex would not be willing to provide a transferable L/C and
                    therefore deliberately included that as a term in the draft contract in
                    anticipation of Gimpex’s refusal such that they could carry out the
                    swap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    We are therefore not persuaded by
                    Gimpex’s submission in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   The defendants’ refusal to conduct the joint
                inspection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    It is not disputed that Gimpex proposed to
                    the defendants that a joint inspection be conducted on the coal which arrived in
                    Karachi, but the defendants refused. Gimpex submits that this is because the
                    defendants knew that the coal shipped on board the Vessel was grossly
                    off-specifications as a result of the defendants’ fraudulent acts. There
                    was no other reason why the defendants would refuse a joint inspection as that
                    would put to rest all doubts over the quality of the coal, and that such an
                    inference should be drawn by the court from the defendants’
                    refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The defendants’ response was that the
                    Sucofindo Report was agreed to by the parties to be final and binding, and so
                    there was no further need to conduct a joint inspection. Furthermore,
                    Kishore’s experience in Karachi where he witnessed the pilferage of the
                    coal and received death threats made them wary as to whether a joint inspection
                    would be fair. This was not to say that the court-appointed surveyor would be
                    biased, as explained by Vinay. Instead, the concern was that there was no
                    knowing what Gimpex and/or Awan might have done to the coal in the meantime. Any
                    agreement by the defendants for a joint inspection would only lend credibility
                    to Gimpex’s allegation of manipulation of the coal by the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The Judge did not agree with the
                    defendants’ submission on this issue, explaining that it was doubtful that
                    threats were in fact made on Kishore’s life, and that pilferage of the
                    coal would make it all the more necessary for a joint inspection to be
                    conducted. While we decline to disturb the Judge’s factual finding as to
                    the credibility of Kishore’s evidence on the threats made against him, we
                    find that the defendants’ argument regarding the pilferage is a fair one.
                    We find that it was not entirely unreasonable for the defendants to think that a
                    joint inspection would not give a fair result given that the coal was in
                    Awan’s control and that Kishore had witnessed the pilferage of the
                    coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    We would, however, add that in the reply by
                    O&amp;B to R&amp;T, after R&amp;T (on behalf of Gimpex) proposed the joint
                    inspection, the first (and only) response by the defendants was that the joint
                    inspection was pointless because Gimpex having rejected the coal had nothing
                    more to do with the coal (see above at [29]–[30]). Apart from the fact
                    that this was a self-serving statement which assumed that the rejection of the
                    coal was unlawful in the first place, the defendants did not raise any of the
                    arguments which they now rely on in that reply email. This diminished the
                    credibility of their reasons for rejecting the joint inspection. But in fairness
                    to the defendants, the facts supporting these various reasons now raised by the
                    defendants were included in the earlier emails between O&amp;B and R&amp;T (see
                    above at [28]). Therefore, we do not think that the reasons given by the
                    defendants were entirely an afterthought. In that connection, we decline to draw
                    the inference that the joint inspection was rejected <em>only</em> because the defendants <em>knew</em>
                    that the coal was of grossly inferior quality and did not meet the contractual
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   The sale of the coal to FZC at the low price</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Gimpex submits that the fact that the
                    defendants sold the coal to FZC at US$48.63 per MT is itself damning on their
                    case. Gimpex’s point is that if the defendants were confident that the
                    coal delivered at Karachi conformed to the contractual specifications, there
                    would be no reason for them to have sold the coal at such a low
                price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Vinay’s explanation for this was that
                    he was left with no choice but to sell the coal to FZC, which was an associate
                    company of Awan. This was because the coal was stored in Awan’s coal yard,
                    and the defendants did not have any control over the coal. The defendants also
                    believed that the coal was being pilfered, as witnessed by Kishore. Furthermore,
                    the coal was being left out in the open and its quality would likely deteriorate
                    over time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In the same vein as that relating to the
                    defendants’ refusal of the proposed joint inspection of the coal, we find
                    that there was some basis for the defendants’ concern in this regard. The
                    fact that the coal was sold to an associate company of Awan could be argued to
                    be a circumstance which bolstered the defendants’ case because it
                    indicated that they were at their wits’ end regarding the mitigation of
                    their losses bearing in mind that the coal then was no longer in their
                    control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(7)   The missing Berkah contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    It is undisputed that the source of the
                    Cargo supplied by Unity was PT Planet, which in turn bought the coal from
                    Berkah. Unity paid US$63.50 per MT for the coal which suggests that the
                    coal was of good quality.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Gimpex’s case is
                    that it would be easy for Unity to collude with PT Planet to enter into a
                    contract with an inflated purchase price since PT Planet is owned by Unity and
                    Classic, and Vinay was a director of both Unity and PT Planet. If there was a
                    document which could show the true quality of the coal delivered by Unity to
                    Gimpex, it would have been the contract between PT Planet and
                    Berkah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    However, Vinay’s evidence in court was
                    that they had lost their copy of the contract because “we were shifting
                    offices at that time”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> When pressed to give
                    details on this shifting of office, Vinay could not do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Vinay was
                    also cross-examined on whether there were any email exchanges between Berkah and
                    himself which could possibly shed light on the quality of the coal purchased,
                    but Vinay replied that there were none and perhaps Lalit was the better person
                    to ask. When Lalit took the stand, he gave evidence that his contact in Berkah
                    was one Raymond. He also said that he had tried to contact Raymond subsequently
                    to obtain a copy of the Berkah contract but was unable to do so. He therefore on
                    11 Jan 2013 sent an email to PT Planet to ask for the contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In that
                    email, the response from one Doddy Purwana was that PT Planet was trying to get
                    a copy of the Berkah contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The defendants’ other response was to
                    say that there was nothing sinister at all for Unity to purchase coal from PT
                    Planet, and for PT Planet in turn to purchase coal from Berkah. They explained
                    that the reason for Unity having procured the coal via PT Planet was not to
                    defraud anyone, but rather to ensure that the ultimate supplier of the coal was
                    not exposed. This was because the defendants were trying to protect their
                    interests as the middleman in future purchases/sales of coal, and were afraid
                    that Gimpex might purchase coal directly from Berkah at a cheaper
                price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    While we accept that there is nothing wrong
                    with having the coal supplied via another party, what remains disturbing is the
                    fact that the contract between PT Planet and Berkah could not be found. The
                    defendants’ explanations for this are also unsatisfactory, and are
                    indicative that they may be trying to hide something.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(8)   The prevention of SCCI from inspecting and sampling the
                coal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Gimpex’s submission was that SCCI was
                    stopped from inspecting and sampling the coal because the defendants knew that
                    the coal was of grossly inferior quality and did not meet the contractual
                    specifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The defendants’ submission was that
                    under Art 4.5, SCCI was only allowed to witness the loading of the coal, and
                    that was allowed by the defendants eventually. However, as we find that Art 4.5
                    did not limit SCCI to only witnessing the loading of the coal, and did not
                    preclude them from collecting samples themselves, there is no basis for the
                    defendants’ submissions (see above at [73]). We therefore affirm the
                    Judge’s finding that the defendant should not have stopped SCCI from
                    conducting sampling of the coal on the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(9)   Was the Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim made out?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    The Unlawful Means Conspiracy Claim, as
                    previously mentioned, is premised on the defendants committing fraud on Gimpex.
                    The standard of proof in finding fraud has been espoused in a number of
                    Singapore decisions. In <em>Tang Yoke Kheng trading as (Niklex
                        Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263
                        (“<em>Tang Yoke Kheng</em>”), the Court
                    of Appeal (at [14]) rejected that there was a third standard of proof which
                    existed in between the civil burden of balance of probabilities and the criminal
                    burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt. However, the court went on to explain
                        (<em>ibid</em>) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… because of the severity and potentially serious implications
                        attaching to a fraud, even in a civil trial, judges are not normally
                        satisfied by that little bit more evidence such as to tilt the "balance".
                        They normally require more. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, we would reiterate that the standard of proof in a civil case,
                        including cases where fraud is alleged, is that based on a balance of
                        probabilities; but the more serious the allegation, the more the party, on
                        whose shoulders the burden of proof falls, may have to do if he hopes to
                        establish his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    This ruling in <em>Tang Yoke
                        Kheng</em> was recently affirmed in the Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 308, which referred, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to the High Court decision of <em>Chua Kwee
                        Chen v Koh Choon Chin</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 469. In the latter
                    decision, Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was), explained (at [159])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the standard of proof in civil proceedings where fraud and/or
                        dishonesty is alleged is the civil standard of proof on a balance of
                        probabilities. However, where such an allegation is made (as in the present
                        proceedings), <em>more</em> evidence is required than
                        would be the situation in an ordinary civil case. Such an inquiry lies,
                        therefore and in the final analysis, in the sphere of practical application
                        (rather than theoretical speculation). [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Having regard to the fact that more evidence
                    is required in order for the party alleging fraud to prove it in a civil case,
                    we do not think that Gimpex has proved its case. Although there are some issues
                    which we find troubling and might suggest a lack of good faith on the part of
                    the defendants (for example, non-production of the Berkeh contract; and
                    disallowing SCCI to witness and conduct sampling), we also find that there are
                    circumstances which lend support to the defendants’ case. Breach of
                    contract does not necessarily constitute fraud. A very important premise of
                    Gimpex’s claim for fraud is the assertion that Unity was switched for
                    Param Energy with an improper motive in mind. But the switch was brought about
                    by Gimpex (see [168] above). Neither is Unity a shell company. Our conclusion is
                    that the evidence before this court is insufficient to satisfy us that the
                    defendants consciously and in full knowledge entered into the Contract with
                    Gimpex with a deliberate intention to deliver poor quality coal to Gimpex which
                    did not meet the contractual specifications, while attempting to collect the
                    purchase price and dissipate the money, leaving Gimpex with a cause of action
                    for breach of contract against a Unity which was a shell company incorporated in
                    the BVI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    We therefore do not find that the defendants
                    have committed fraud on Gimpex. It follows that Gimpex’s Unlawful Means
                    Conspiracy Claim fails <em>in limine</em>, and there is no
                    need for us to consider the further issues of whether there was an agreement
                    between Unity, Param Energy and Vinay to commit fraud on Gimpex, and whether
                    Gimpex suffered damage as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Lawful Means Conspiracy Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    In order to establish a claim in lawful
                    means conspiracy, there is a need for the plaintiff to show that the predominant
                    purpose of the conspirators was to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff:
                    (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Quay Kay Tee
                        v Ong and Co Pte Ltd</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 637; <em>Wu
                        Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co Ltd</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 451).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In the present case, there is simply
                    insufficient evidence to suggest that Unity, Param Energy, and Vinay came
                    together and caused Unity to enter into a contract with Gimpex with the
                    predominant purpose of harming Gimpex. In fact, Lalit’s evidence was that
                    the defendants were willing to enter into the Contract for a small profit margin
                    of 1.83% because they wanted to cultivate a long-term commercial relationship
                    with Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    We therefore dismiss Gimpex’s claim in
                    lawful means conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue relating to joint tortfeasor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Gimpex relies on the Privy Council decision
                    on appeal from Singapore in <em>Wah Tat Bank Ltd and others v
                        Chan</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 284 to establish that Vinay should
                    be liable as well. However, this is premised on a tort having been committed in
                    the first place. Given our earlier findings that both the Unlawful Means
                    Conspiracy Claim and the lawful means conspiracy claim are not made out, there
                    is no tort upon which Param Energy and Vinay can be held to be joint
                    tortfeasors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue relating to the lifting of the corporate veil </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Turning to the issue of the lifting of
                    corporate veils of Unity and Param Energy, we can be brief. First, the presence
                    of SMIL as the major shareholder of Unity (51%) makes it difficult to find that
                    Vinay had control over Unity. Furthermore, there is no evidence which suggests
                    that Vinay had any ownership interest or was a director of SMIL. Vinay only had
                    an indirect 25% shareholding in Unity through Param Energy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Secondly, as found by the Judge, Dev who was
                    one of the directors of Unity and also a director of SMASL, gave evidence that
                    Vinay was not even a signatory to any of Unity’s bank accounts. Unity had
                    a bank account with Standard Chartered Bank of which Dev was the sole signatory,
                    and another bank account with the Bank of India of which Dev and one Rudra Sen
                    Sindhu were the only signatories.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    We therefore find that the corporate veil of
                    Unity should not be lifted in the present case. Consequently, there is also no
                    reason to lift the corporate veil of Param Energy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue relating to damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Gimpex’s submission is that if the
                    appeal by the defendants in CA 161/2013 against the Judge’s decision
                    to allow the Breach of Contract Claim is dismissed, damages should be assessed
                    by this court, and not, as ordered by the Judge, be assessed later separately by
                    the Registrar. This is because both parties adduced evidence and made
                    submissions on this issue below. In light of our decision to dismiss the appeal
                    in CA 161/2013, and having reviewed the evidence and the submissions, we are
                    minded to do so as urged upon us by Gimpex.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Gimpex’s submissions on damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Gimpex’s primary claim is for breach
                    of warranty on the part of Unity in delivering off-specification coal, and its
                    alternative claim is for non-delivery of coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In relation to its claim for breach of
                    warranty, Gimpex relies on s 53 of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, Rev Ed 1999)
                    (“the SGA”), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Remedy for breach of
                            warranty</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>53.—</b>(1) Where there is a breach of warranty by the
                        seller, or where the buyer elects (or is compelled) to treat any breach of a
                        condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty, the buyer is
                        not by reason only of such breach of warranty entitled to reject the goods;
                        but he may —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) set up against the seller the breach
                            of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) maintain an action against the
                            seller for damages for the breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss
                        directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the
                        breach of warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss is prima facie
                        the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the
                        buyer and the value they would have had if they had fulfilled the
                        warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) The fact that the buyer has set up the breach of warranty in
                        diminution or extinction of the price does not prevent him from maintaining
                        an action for the same breach of warranty if he has suffered further
                        damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Gimpex submits that pursuant to s 53(3), the
                    measure of damages should be the difference between the market price of the low
                    quality coal delivered at Karachi and the market price of coal that meets the
                    quality specified in the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    With regard to the market price of the low
                    quality coal delivered at Karachi, as mentioned earlier at [157], Gimpex’s
                    pricing expert, Liang Yuan, gave evidence that the price would be US$38 to US$44
                    per MT. This would give a median price of US$41 per MT. Liang Yuan’s
                    evidence was not challenged by the defendants in
                cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    As regards the market price of coal that met
                    the quality specified in the Contract, Gimpex submits that the relevant time at
                    which the price should be ascertained would be the time when the defect was
                    discovered (relying on the cases of <em>Van Den Hurk v R Martens
                        &amp; Co, Limited (in liquidation)</em> [1920] 1 KB 850 and <em>Naugthon v O’Callaghan</em> [1990] 3 All ER 191).
                    Gimpex’s position is that this would be in May 2010. Liang Yuan’s
                    evidence was that when the coal was discharged in Karachi between 8 to 12 May
                    2010, the price of the coal of the quality specified in the Contract was then
                    US$83 per MT. Gimpex also took pains to point out that Gunn’s evidence was
                    that in June 2010, the price of coal that met the said quality was even higher,
                    at US$88.19 per MT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Gimpex then concluded that the quantum of
                    damages based on its claim for breach of warranty for the delivery of
                    off-specification coal should therefore be (US$83 - US$41) ×
                    41,510MT = US$1,743,420.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    However, there are two problems to this
                    approach of assessing the appropriate damages to be award to Gimpex. First, the
                    buyer (Gimpex) must have taken delivery of the sub-quality coal. Secondly, the
                    buyer must have paid the contract price for the sub-quality coal. Neither of
                    these events had taken place here. Gimpex cannot simply assert that they had not
                    in fact rejected the coal. The coal was in fact sold by Unity to FZC, a
                    subsidiary of Awan, at a much reduced price (see [32] above). The way in which
                    Gimpex has calculated the damages due to it as shown in [200] is to
                    overcompensate itself. Not having paid for the coal in accordance with the
                    Contract price, it is not entitled to claim for the difference between the
                    sub-quality coal price and the contract price. It would only be entitled to
                    claim as damages the sum representing the difference between the contract price
                    and the price at which the coal could have fetched in the open market if the
                    coal delivered had been of the right quality. This brings us to the alternative
                    basis of assessing Gimpex’s loss and the application of s 51 of the
                    SGA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Damages for
                            non-delivery</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>51.</b>—(1) Where the seller wrongfully
                        neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may
                        maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally
                        resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach
                        of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the
                        measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference
                        between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at
                        the time or times when they ought to have been delivered or (if no time was
                        fixed) at the time of the refusal to deliver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Gimpex submits that pursuant to s 51(3), the
                    measure of damages should be the difference between the Contract price (which is
                    US$66 per MT) and the market price of the coal at the time the coal ought to
                    have been delivered. Liang Yuan’s evidence was that the open market price
                    of the coal of the quality sold by Unity to Gimpex in Pakistan in May 2010 was
                    US$89. On this basis, the loss suffered by Gimpex would therefore be (US$89 -
                    US$66) × 41,510MT = US$954,730. In the normal case, this
                    would indisputably be the loss suffered by a buyer in similar circumstances.
                    This manner of assessing damages would also be in line with the principles
                    established in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch
                    341 (“<em>Hadley v
                Baxendale</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ submission on damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    The defendants submit that based on the case
                    of <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“<em>Robertson
                        Quay Investment</em>”), which applies the rule in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>, the measure of damages should be the
                    loss of profit suffered by Gimpex instead. This was the measure of damages that
                    flowed directly, naturally, and in the ordinary course of events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The defendants therefore submit that the
                    damages payable should be based on the difference between the prices of coal
                    contracted for between Gimpex and Unity (which is US$66 per MT), and Gimpex and
                    Awan (which is US$68 per MT). This would give a sum total of (US$68 - US$66)
                        × 41,510MT = US$83,020.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    In the alternative, the defendants submitted
                    that Gimpex should be entitled to claim damages calculated based on the
                    difference between the prevailing market price of the off-specification coal and
                    the agreed contract price between Gimpex and Awan. No reason or authority was
                    cited for this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    In addition, the defendants made the
                    submission that the court “should reserve this specific claim for
                    assessment [until] a claim is brought by [Awan]”, relying on the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>China Resources Purchasing Co Ltd v Yue
                        Xiu Enterprises (S) Pte Ltd and another</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 397
                        (“<em>China Resources</em>”). In
                        <em>China Resources</em>, the plaintiff claimed against
                    the defendant for the non-delivery of goods. It was not disputed by the parties
                    that the plaintiff’s purchase of the goods was for the purpose of
                    immediate resale to a sub-buyer. The plaintiff obtained an interlocutory
                    judgment against the defendant by way of judgment or declaration that the
                    plaintiff be entitled to recover from the defendant such damages and costs for
                    which the plaintiff may be held liable to pay to the sub-buyer. The court
                    proceeded on that premise, and assessed and awarded damages for the loss of
                    profit to the plaintiff, but reserved the issue of the indemnity for the
                    plaintiff’s liability to the sub-buyer. The reason for this was because
                    until proceedings had actually been commenced against the plaintiff by the
                    sub-buyer, the extent of the plaintiff’s liability was uncertain, and so
                    the proper course would be to defer dealing with that issue until such time as
                    was appropriate. In arriving at this decision, the court did not have to
                    consider what the appropriate <em>measure of damages</em>
                    was. It simply proceeded on the basis of the declaration obtained by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The defendants argue that since Gimpex has
                    not established liability in respect of a claim from Awan, “the Court
                    should likewise reserve this item of [Gimpex’s] claim for assessment if
                    and when a claim is brought by Awan against [Gimpex]
                        …”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> It should be apparent that the
                    head of damage reserved by the Court of Appeal in <em>China
                        Resources</em> related to an indemnity claim. This, however, is not
                    what Gimpex is claiming for before this court. Its claim is for damages based on
                    either breach of warranty of quality or non-delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    In the present proceedings, Gimpex in its
                    pleadings did include a claim for an indemnity against any liability it might
                    have incurred towards Awan for the former’s breach of contract to the
                    latter. The defendants’ suggestion at [206]–[207] is probably its
                    response to that (although the defendants’ submissions are unclear on
                    this). Before us (and, indeed, before the Judge as well) this particular head of
                    damage was not sought for by Gimpex. In addition, for reasons explained
                    immediately below, the premise for the application of <em>China
                        Resources</em> in this case does not even arise. There, the damages
                    claimed were for loss of profit plus an indemnity against third party liability.
                    In the present case, before both the High Court and this court, Gimpex no longer
                    pursued the claim for an indemnity against third-party liability but only prayed
                    for damages for the breach of contract on the part of Unity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appropriate measure of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    The main issue before us is whether the
                    measure of damages should be the difference between the Contract price and the
                    market price of the coal at the time the coal ought to have been delivered
                    (which is Gimpex’s position) or the loss of profit plus an indemnity
                    against any future liability to Awan (which is the defendants’ position).
                    Given that there has been no action taken by Awan against Gimpex for
                    Gimpex’s failure to deliver coal of the correct specifications, and having
                    regard to the drastic increase in the market price of the coal, it is not
                    surprising that the parties have adopted different approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    In this regard, the House of Lords decision
                    of <em>Williams Brothers v ED T Agius, Limited</em> [1914]
                    1 AC 510 (“<em>Williams v Agius</em>”) is
                    very much on point. In that case, the buyer contracted with the seller for coal
                    to be shipped and delivered at the price of 16s 3d. Before the date of delivery,
                    the buyer agreed to sell the coal to a sub-buyer at the price of 19s. The
                    seller, in breach of contract, failed to deliver the coal to the buyer. At the
                    date of breach, the market price of the coal was 23s 6d. The issue before the
                    court was whether the measure of damages in respect of non-delivery of the coal
                    was the difference between the contract price and the market price of the coal
                    at the time of breach (as contended by the buyer), or the difference between the
                    contract price and the price at which the buyer had sold the coal to the
                    sub-buyer (as contended by the seller). The court unanimously found for the
                    buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    As explained by Lord Dunedin, this was
                    premised on an application of the trite principle of contract law that the
                    innocent party must be put in the same position as if the breach of contract had
                    not occurred (at 522–523):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… when there is no delivery of the goods the position is quite a
                        different one. The buyer never gets them, and he is entitled to be put in
                        the position in which he would have stood if he had got them at the due
                        date. That position is the position of a man who has goods at the market
                        price of the day—and barring special circumstances, <em>the defaulting seller is neither mulct in damages for the extra profit
                            which the buyer would have got owing to a forward resale at over the
                            market price</em> (<em>Great Western Ry. Co. v.
                            Redmayne</em>), <em>nor can he take benefit of the
                            fact that the buyer has made a forward resale at under the market
                            price.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Viscount Haldane LC (at 520) also made the
                    important point that the existence of a sub-sale by the buyer should have no
                    effect on the damages payable by the <em>seller to the
                        buyer</em> under the agreement entered into between them, and
                    reaffirmed the judgment of Lord Esher MR in the English Court of Appeal decision
                    in <em>Rodocanachi, Sons &amp; Co v Milburn Brothers</em>
                    (1886) 18 QBD 67 (“<em>Rodocanachi v
                    Milburn</em>”). In <em>Rodocanachi v
                        Milburn</em>, the court had to consider the same issue of whether the
                    measure of damages should be the difference in contract price and the market
                    price of goods or the difference between the contract price and the price as set
                    out in the sub-sale. Lord Esher MR held (at 76–77) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that the rule as to measure of damages in a case of this kind must
                        be this: the measure is the difference between the position of a plaintiff
                        if the goods had been safely delivered and his position if the goods are
                        lost. What, then, is that difference? … If there is no market for
                        such goods, the result must be arrived at by an estimate, by taking the cost
                        of the goods to the shipper and adding to that the estimated profit he would
                        make at the port of destination. If there is a market there is no occasion
                        to have recourse to such a mode of estimating the value; the value will be
                        the market value when the goods ought to have arrived. But the value is to
                        be taken independently of any circumstances peculiar to the plaintiff. It is
                        well settled that in an action for non-delivery or non-acceptance of goods
                        under a contract of sale the law does not take into account in estimating
                        the damages anything that is accidental as between the plaintiff and the
                        defendant, as for instance an intermediate contract entered into with a
                        third party for the purchase or sale of the goods. It is admitted in this
                        case that, if the plaintiffs had sold the goods for more than the market
                        value before their arrival, they could not recover on the basis of that
                        price, but would be confined to the market price, because the circumstance
                        that they had so sold the goods at a higher price would be an accidental
                        circumstance as between themselves and the shipowners; but it is said that,
                        as they have sold for a price less than the market price, the market price
                        is not to govern but the contract price. I think, that if the law were so,
                        it would be very unjust. I adopt the rule laid down in Mayne on Damages,
                        which gives the market price as the test by which to estimate the value of
                        the goods independently of any circumstances peculiar to the plaintiff, and
                        so independently of any contract made by him for sale of the goods. That
                        rule gives the mode of estimating the value which is to be taken for the
                        purpose of arriving at the damages. ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Reverting to <em>Williams v
                        Agius</em>, Lord Dunedin also made the same point as Lord Esher MR
                    that any contract between the buyer and the sub-buyer was not something that
                    should be of concern to the court in determining the liabilities vis-à-vis the
                    buyer and seller. The liabilities between the buyer and the sub-buyer should be
                    left to those two parties (at 523):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The truth is that the respondents' argument leaves them in a dilemma.
                        Either the sub-sale was of the identical article which was the subject of
                        the principal sale or it was not. If it was not, it is absurd to suppose
                        that a contract with a third party as to something else, just because it is
                        the same kind of thing, can reduce the damages which the unsatisfied buyer
                        is entitled to recover under the original contract. If, on the other hand,
                        the sub-sale is of the selfsame thing or things as is or are the subject of
                        the principal sale, then <em>ex hypothesi</em> the
                        default of the seller in the original sale is going to bring about an
                        enforced default on the part of the original buyer and subsequent seller.
                        And how can it ever be known that the damages recoverable under that
                        contract will be calculable in precisely the same way as in the original
                        contract? All that will depend upon what the sub-buyer will be able to make
                        out. <em>The only safe plan is, therefore, in the original
                            contract, to take the difference of market price as the measure of
                            damages and to leave the sub-contract and the breach thereof to be
                            worked out by those whom it directly concerns</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Applying these principles to the present,
                    Unity should not be allowed to rely on the contract between Gimpex and Awan to
                    reduce its liability. As a matter of logic, there is also no reason why any
                    benefit arising from Awan not suing Gimpex should go to Unity. There may be many
                    reasons why Awan is not suing Gimpex. It could be because of, for example,
                    certain differences in the terms of the Contract and the contract between Awan
                    and Gimpex, the relationship between Awan and Gimpex, or any commercial
                    considerations which this court is not privy to and should not speculate
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Gimpex should be put in the position as if
                    the defendants did not breach the Contract. That means that Gimpex should have
                    obtained the coal of the quality specified in the Contract, and if there is an
                    increase in the market value of the coal from the time of contracting and the
                    time of delivery, then Gimpex must be compensated on the basis of the coal
                    having a higher value. As it is undisputed that there is a market for the coal
                    at the time of the breach, it should be clear that the measure of damages should
                    be the difference between the Contract price and the market price of the coal at
                    the time the coal ought to have been delivered. This is the <em>prima facie</em> measure of damages under s 51(3) of the
                SGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    For completeness, we would observe that had
                    it been the understanding of the parties at the <em>time of
                        contracting</em>, that Gimpex had bought the coal specifically in
                    order to fulfil its contractual commitment to Awan to provide coal of the exact
                    same quantity and quality, and if the Contract had provided for sub-sales down
                    the line, the defendants could have had a much stronger case to say that
                    Gimpex’s loss flowing from the breach of Contract was its loss of profit
                    plus any potential liability to Awan (see the House of Lords decision in
                        <em>Hall (R and H) Ltd v W H Pim (Junior) &amp; Co's
                        Arbitration</em> (1928) 33 Com Cas 324; the Singapore High Court
                    decision in <em>Fazlur Rahman v Bombay Trading Co ((Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 529; and generally <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (M G Bridge, gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2010) at paras 17–028–17–033). However, since
                    the evidence is that the defendants did not know or have knowledge of the exact
                    terms of the Sub-contract until much later, and the Contract did not contain any
                    term providing for sub-sales down the line, we do not need to consider a claim
                    on such a basis any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Finally, we come to the ascertainment of the
                    market price of the coal at the time of breach. Gimpex’s evidence of this
                    is based on Liang Yuan’s expert report. As mentioned earlier, the
                    defendants did not cross-examine Liang Yun on his affidavit evidence, but raised
                    certain queries in a Notice of Objections to Contents of Affidavit of
                        Evidence-in-Chief.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The main issue the defendants had
                    with Liang Yun’s evidence was that a lot of it was based on assertions
                    made without much explanation. It was therefore surprising that Liang Yun was
                    not challenged on the stand by the defendants’ counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    This was especially troubling because Liang
                    Yun’s evidence on the market price of the coal at the time of breach was
                    problematic. In the same report, Liang Yuan was asked to give his opinion on
                    four issues. One of those issues was, “What was the market price of coal
                    at the time of discharge in Pakistan between 8-12 May 2010?”. Liang
                    Yuan’s answer was that, “the market price of the 6300 GAD (5815
                    GAR) calorific value coal FOB Indonesia between 8-12 May 2010 would be about USD
                    83 [per MT]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Another issue was, “What was the
                    price of coal on the Pakistan market on 8-12 May 2010?”. This time, Liang
                    Yuan’s response (just two pages later) was that the price of the coal was
                    US$89 per MT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    First, we fail to understand what the
                    difference between the two issues put to Liang Yuan as set out in the preceding
                    paragraphs is. The issues although framed slightly differently from each other
                    are essentially asking the same question. Even the dates of “8-12 May
                    2010” were the same and hence the different answers provided from Liang
                    Yuan were incomprehensible. Secondly, Gimpex relied on the figure of US$83 per
                    MT in calculating the market price of the coal in respect of its claim based on
                    the breach of warranty for the off-specification coal pursuant to s 53(3) of the
                    SGA. Yet, Gimpex relied on the figure of US$89 per MT in calculating the market
                    price of the coal under its claim for non-delivery of coal pursuant to s 51(3)
                    of the SGA. We do not understand why the two figures should be different as they
                    relate to the market value of the same quality coal at the same relevant
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    In light of this confusion, and given the
                    lack of explanation by Liang Yun, we do not think that Gimpex should be allowed
                    to simply rely on the higher figure of US$89 per MT as the market price of the
                    coal. The burden is on Gimpex to prove its loss. While Gunn’s evidence was
                    that the market price of coal of the contractual specifications was US$88.19,
                    that was as at June 2010, not May 2010 (the date of the breach). The benefit of
                    the uncertainty should be given to Unity. We therefore hold that the damages to
                    be awarded to Gimpex should be based on the lower figure of US$83 per
                MT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    We therefore find that Unity is liable to
                    Gimpex for the sum of (US$83 - US$66) × 41,510MT =
                    US$705,670.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In conclusion, the appeal in CA 160/2013 is
                    allowed in so far as damages for the Breach of Contract Claim are assessed by
                    this court at US$705,670. The appeal in CA 161/2013 is dismissed. Parties are to
                    make written submission on costs within two weeks hereof.</p>
