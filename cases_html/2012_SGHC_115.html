        Chao Hick Tin JA:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant was caught
                    after a month-long spree during which he harassed loan
                    sharks’ debtors by splashing paint, locking doors,
                    setting fires, and writing “O$P$” outside
                    their homes. The appellant pleaded guilty to 24 charges
                    with a further 48 charges taken into consideration. The
                    charges that the Prosecution proceeded with fell into four
                    categories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first category (five
                    charges) dealt with harassment by fire. The appellant was
                    sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and three
                    strokes of the cane for each charge in the first category.
                    The second category (three charges) related to locking the
                    victims’ doors with bicycle locks. The appellant was
                    sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment and three
                    strokes of the cane for each charge. The third category (15
                    charges) concerned the splashing of paint. He was sentenced
                    to 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of
                    the cane for each charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       These three categories of
                    charges related to the offence under s 28(2) (read with
                    s 28(1)) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188,
                    2010 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).
                        Section 28(2)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Act applies to first-time offenders and provides for
                    mandatory imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of
                    $5,000 to $50,000. The punishment for repeat offenders is
                    found in s 28(2)(<em>b</em>):
                    between two to nine years’ imprisonment and a fine of
                    $6,000 to $60,000. Where there is damage to property,
                        s 28(3)(<em>b</em>)(<em>i</em>) provides that three to six
                    strokes of the cane will be imposed. The Prosecution
                    confirmed during the hearing of the appeal that it was not
                    proceeding under s 28(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The fourth category
                    comprised a single charge of assisting in unlicensed
                    money-lending activities by distributing the namecards of a
                    loan shark called “David”. This is an offence
                    under s 14 of the Act. The punishment for first time
                    offenders is a fine of $30,000 to $300,000 and mandatory
                    imprisonment of up to four years. The appellant was
                    sentenced to one month’s imprisonment and fined
                    $30,000 on this charge. The remaining 48 charges were mainly
                    for harassment by splashing paint and writing on walls, with
                    one count of assisting in unlicensed
                moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The District Judge ordered
                    three sentences for fire harassment and one sentence for
                    paint harassment to run consecutively. That gave a global
                    sentence of 84 months’ imprisonment, 24 strokes
                    of the cane, and a $30,000 fine. The appellant has now
                    appealed to this court on the ground that the
                    84 months’ imprisonment term is manifestly
                    excessive in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant is a 44 year
                    old man. He has two daughters. The elder is studying in a
                    Polytechnic and the younger has been diagnosed with
                    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The
                    appellant’s wife recently underwent an operation for
                    cervical cancer. He is the sole breadwinner for his family.
                    His parents are old and ill – his father has high
                    blood pressure and diabetes and his mother has recurrent
                    psychiatric issues. The appellant was unemployed at the time
                    of his arrest and had previously worked in sales for the
                    high-end fashion stable Club21. He has an otherwise
                    crime-free record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the appellant,
                    his troubles began when he agreed to guarantee a
                    friend’s loan from a loan shark. His friend fled
                    Singapore without paying. It appears that the appellant was
                    initially able to service the loan, but in October 2010 he
                    was retrenched from his sales job. He sought help from the
                    Chinese Development Assistance Council and from his Member
                    of Parliament (“MP”), but could not find a
                    job. To repay the outstanding loan, he began borrowing from
                    other loan sharks. To pay these new debts, he took on even
                    more loans. In half a year’s time, the amount of money
                    he owed to the loan sharks escalated from $5,000 to $13,000.
                    To repay them he decided to sell his Housing and Development
                    Board (“HDB”) flat. But it took some time for
                    the sale of the flat to be completed, and by the time of
                    completion his loans had ballooned to $40,000, owed to some
                    30 different loan sharks. At this time, he was advised by
                    his friends to run and leave the new homebuyer to face the
                    loan sharks’ wrath. The appellant did not take his
                    friends’ advice even though he could not pay the loans
                    in full. Only $30,000 was available from the sale proceeds
                    to repay the loans (presumably he downgraded to a smaller
                    flat). He was still unemployed and still short of
                    $10,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Options running out, he
                    started working for the loan sharks in May 2011. The victim
                    had now turned terror. But according to him he was a
                    harasser with a heart, acting with reluctance and regret. He
                    never harassed a house if he saw a sign stating that the
                    debtors had already moved out. He diluted the paint with
                    turpentine in the ratio of 1:1 so it could be easily wiped
                    away. He splattered only half a plastic cup’s worth of
                    paint to minimise the occupants’ trouble of cleaning
                    up. He wrote on the walls with a non-permanent white board
                    marker so the intimidating scrawls could be removed with a
                    wet cloth. As for the fires he started, he refrained from
                    using highly flammable fuel like kerosene. Instead, he used
                    Zippo lighter fluid that burned out quickly. He would splash
                    a small amount of lighter fluid and ignite it with lighted
                    tissue paper. The fire would die out in about five seconds,
                    and he always stayed behind to ensure that it did not burn
                    for long. It was true that three of the five fire incidents
                    were done in the dead of night, but the appellant said that
                    he was there to ensure that the fire would not get out of
                    hand. Once, he had even moved a shoe rack for fear that he
                    might accidentally set it alight. The Prosecution did not
                    say that the damage caused by the fires lit by the appellant
                    had resulted in anything more serious than minor burn marks
                    on the door. None of the five police reports made by the
                    victims of his harassments by fire mentioned major damage
                    caused by the fires. One occupant did not even say that a
                    fire had been lit. Another mistook the ashes from the fire
                    as the result of someone burning incense paper outside his
                    home. The money was good – about $70 for a paint job,
                    and $300 for a fire job. With more than 70 instances in
                    slightly over a month, he seemed to be in a hurry. His
                    target premises ranged from Pasir Ris to Jurong West. No job
                    seemed too far for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       His luck ran out on
                    13 June 2011 when the police caught up with him in Toa
                    Payoh. Earlier in the day, he had just been out splashing
                    paint on a flat in Tampines. Arrested with the paraphernalia
                    of a loan shark hitman, he could not deny his guilt. In any
                    event, he said he was filled with relief at finally being
                    stopped. Eager to make amends, he started confessing to
                    instances of harassment that the police would otherwise
                    never have been able to pin on him. Just as his loan debt
                    had escalated, the charges against him swelled – from
                    fewer than five to 72. As the number of charges ballooned
                    due to his confessions, his difficulties with the law
                    deepened. What began as a favour for a friend had now
                    snowballed into multiple grave breaches of the law on his
                    part. Lacking money to engage a lawyer, he appeals in
                    person. He recognised that he had done grave wrongs and
                    ought to be appropriately punished, but he urged the court
                    to look at the entire circumstances of the case and to show
                    mercy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parliament’s intended approach towards loan
                shark offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The High Court has, in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Nelson Jeyaraj
                        </em><em>s/o Chandran</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 1130 (<em>“PP v
                        Nelson Jeyaraj</em>”) at [38]–[40], referred to
                    Parliament’s rationale in enhancing the penalties for
                    loan shark related offences. This was to more effectively
                    stem the rise of loan shark activities that were causing
                    public disquiet. What is notable is that Parliament has
                    prescribed mandatory imprisonment and caning even for
                    first-time offenders. In the light of the severity of the
                    mandatory sentences, I have no doubt that Parliament’s
                    intention is to strongly deter the commission of loan shark
                    offences. But this is not to say Parliament has declared
                    indiscriminate war on loan shark harassers. Indeed, the
                    Parliamentary debates show that deterrence is just one
                    aspect of a sophisticated and holistic solution, sensitively
                    tailored to the complex causes of loan shark offences, with
                    discerning sympathy for those involved – victim or
                    harasser.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loan shark offences – a complex species of
                crime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Loan shark offences occur
                    almost exclusively within the margins or fringes of society,
                    involving the poor and vulnerable who desperately need loans
                    but cannot get them from legitimate sources. Parliament has
                    recognised that the root cause of loan shark offences is the
                    fact that the poor and non-creditworthy are unable to get
                    loans from legal sources. When loans go unpaid, harassment
                    begins. Nominated MP Assoc Prof Paulin Tay
                    Straughan highlighted this aspect of loan shark offences
                    during the second reading of the Moneylenders (Amendment)
                    Bill 2010 (“the Bill”) (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (12 January
                    2010) vol 86 at col 2101) and here I quote
                    her:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I have been sitting there and trying to understand
                        what would drive a person to turn to a loanshark for
                        money? It must be out of sheer desperation ... Many in
                        this category, I suspect, will not have a strong
                        informal social support. So to say that they should turn
                        to family and friends is pretty much telling them to go
                        down a blind alley. So, as a society, I hope that we
                        will continue to put effort into creating legitimate
                        formal sources of help for the vulnerable group in our
                        community.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Addressing the root cause
                    of loan shark offences ultimately requires socio-economic
                    and political decisions that lie outside the courts’
                    remit. For example, it is only Parliament that can decide
                    how much welfare the poor should receive, or how widespread
                    and available licensed moneylending should be. The problem
                    of loan shark offences also has to be seen from many angles.
                    Some borrow from loan sharks to repay gambling debts. Youths
                    are lured by easy money into harassing loan shark debtors.
                    Others borrow from such illegal sources to meet a need due
                    to retrenchment or some other personal misfortune. MP Seah
                    Kian Peng during the Parliamentary debates (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                        <em>Official Report</em>
                    (12 January 2010) vol 86 at col 2112) very perceptively
                    observed that fighting loan shark offences may be like
                    squeezing a balloon: the air/problems simply go somewhere
                    else.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parliament’s solution is holistic</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Parliament has chosen to
                    squeeze the balloon with a multi-pronged approach. For
                    example, the Ministry of Home Affairs has set up a
                    specialised department within the Police Force to fight the
                    loan shark syndicates; measures have been taken to freeze
                    the suspected assets of loan sharks; restrictions on
                    licensed moneylending have been eased to widen the
                    availability of funds to the poor; youth community outreach
                    programs have been initiated; and community financial
                    assistance has been increased. Deterrence in the form of
                    severe mandatory sentences is just one facet of this
                    multi-faceted solution. The legislature is alive to the fact
                    that when the majority of loan shark offences are committed
                    by the vulnerable, there is a limit as to how much sheer
                    punishment can achieve.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A group that is especially vulnerable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There is a class of people
                    whom Parliament has recognised as especially vulnerable.
                    These are the people who turn to loan sharks not to pay off
                    their gambling debts, but because of genuinely desperate
                    needs (<em>eg</em> someone in a family
                    that is barely making ends meet is unexpectedly
                    hospitalised). MP Hri Kumar observed (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (12 January
                    2010) vol 86 at col 2066):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Most people do not go to illegal moneylenders and pay
                        those blood-sucking rates because they want to. They are
                        desperate. Borrowing from banks ... is reserved for
                        those who are creditworthy. The typical customer of an
                        illegal moneylender is not. His need for money may,
                        however, be no less real or compelling than the next
                        person. Not everyone has family or friends he can turn
                        to for help.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">MP Irene Ng empathised with the plight of such
                    people when she said (<em>Singapore

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If they could not turn to loansharks, in their depths
                        of anguish and desperation, they may be driven to other
                        actions for money, such as crime – which could be
                        mugging or robbery; for women, it could be prostitution;
                        and for others, perhaps, even suicide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Then Senior Minister of
                    State for Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, agreed and
                    acknowledged that (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (12 January 2010)

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[n]ow, as many MPs have highlighted ... there are
                        borrowers out there who would have a genuine financial
                        need and some of them turn to loansharks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This group of people is not very large. But
                    neither is their pool of options. Very often they have no
                    choice but to borrow from their local loan sharks. In so
                    doing, they indirectly contribute to the increase in loan
                    shark offences. But the Minister explicitly declined for the
                    time being to criminalise such borrowing on the basis that
                    it might disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and
                    desperate (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, <em>Official

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     When the vulnerable are
                    forced to borrow, sometimes they are unable to repay.
                    Trapped, they are forced to turn to crime – loan shark
                    harassment is an option. Such moral dilemmas are on stage
                    often splashed in black and white. But reality is usually in
                    shades of grey. The plight of the vulnerable was recognised
                    by Parliament, and received sympathetic attention. As MP Sin
                    Boon Ann noted (<em>Singapore Parliamentary

                        Government through its public education and counselling
                        programmes. At the moment, illegal moneylending operates
                        very much on the fringe of society. People who are
                        involved in money lending, whether as borrowers or
                        runners, almost to a person, I am confident to say, have
                        personal problems that require help.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the end of the debate, Assoc Prof Ho said

                        Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (12 January 2010) vol 86
                    at cols 2127–2128):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me make this point about borrowers who have become
                        harassers. I think there have [<em>sic</em>] been some sympathy raised in this
                        House for this group and for the need to distinguish
                        this group of borrowers who become harassers for loan
                        sharks. First of all, what we have done in this Bill is
                        to ensure that both groups are punished and I think
                        rightly so both groups should be punished. And from what
                        we have heard in this House … there is, in fact,
                        organised crime; there is layering. Everybody plays a
                        part. They may play different parts but because they are
                        working in concert the pain and problem is
                        perpetuated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The example we have used here is Hydra and the
                        tentacles … But really, the nub of this Bill is
                        that we want to do more to attack the source, which is
                        the kingpins … And yet, at the same time, we have
                        to address the ongoing problem on the ground so we have
                        to cut off the tentacles. We have to ensure that the
                        harassers do not perpetuate the ill intentions of the
                        loansharks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Assoc Prof Ho’s
                    message is clear: although Parliament sympathises with
                    debtors who turn harassers, they are still to be punished.
                    The expression of legislative compassion nevertheless
                    suggests that: (a) while the vulnerable are still to be
                    punished for their role in perpetuating the loan shark
                    scourge, the <em>severity</em> of their
                    punishment might depend on their individual circumstances;
                    and (b) that the court will be entitled, within the range of
                    discretion accorded under the law, to impose such punishment
                    as is consonant with the offender’s culpability.
                    Underlying Parliament’s empathy may be the recognition
                    that more, perhaps, could be done by society for the group
                    of people who have to seek help from loan sharks. As
                    Nominated MP Audrey Wong observed (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (12 January
                    2010) vol 86 at cols 2099–2100):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the Government has assured Singaporeans that the
                        poor and needy in our midst will be looked after
                        … perhaps our current efforts to educate and
                        reach out to the truly needy and desperate are still
                        insufficient to help this minority of people who resort
                        to borrowing from illegal means. As living costs
                        continue to rise and the wages of the lowest-earning in
                        our population may not keep pace with the inflation
                        rate, I am concerned that we may see more financially
                        desperate Singaporeans who may still go to loansharks or
                        work for them despite the risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As for debtors who end up working for loansharks
                        as runners and repeat offenders – I know there are
                        many repeat offenders who go to jail for loanshark
                        activities and repeat their behaviour when they are out
                        of jail – the new stricter laws may act as a
                        deterrent but I believe the truly desperate would still
                        continue to run the risk of the harsher punishment
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Naturally the
                    circumstances of those who help loan sharks, either as
                    runners or harassers, are diverse. For present purposes, it
                    suffices for me to make the point that it is important to
                    distinguish between those who, out of genuinely desperate
                    financial need brought about by events not within their
                    control (<em>eg</em> sudden sickness
                    and prolonged retrenchment), borrow from loan sharks whom
                    they are then forced to work for, and others who are perhaps
                    less deserving of sympathy. For the latter category, two
                    groups come to mind. The first are youth harassers, whom the
                    loan sharks seem to be recruiting in increasing numbers.
                    They are apparently lured by the easy money and the thrill.
                    Parliament’s response to this development is, among
                    others, to enact s 28B of the Act, which makes it an
                    offence for anyone above 21 to procure a minor to harass
                    debtors. Youth outreach programs have also been initiated to
                    educate and counsel. The second group are gamblers who
                    harass for the easy money they can obtain to repay their
                    gambling debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The application of deterrence in this
                context</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It will be apparent from
                    the foregoing that people who are involved in illegal
                    moneylending activities are not a homogenous group. Neither
                    are the offences under the Act. The kingpins are the real
                    and prime targets of the law. But this is not to say that
                    runners and harassers will be treated leniently. This is
                    apparent from the severe mandatory sentences enacted by
                    Parliament targeting loan shark harassers. These prescribed
                    criminal penalties have been carefully and finely calibrated
                    and appear to be based on three main pillars:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     mandatory
                        imprisonment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     mandatory caning where property is
                        damaged; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     a reasonably broad range of
                        flexibility vested in the court to ensure that the
                        punishment is proportionate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The importance of
                    flexibility is clear from Assoc Prof Ho’s exchange
                    with MPs Arthur Fong and Calvin Cheng during the
                    Parliamentary debates on the Bill. MP Arthur Fong advocated
                    a zero-tolerance approach and suggested that Assoc Prof Ho

                        to urge the Minister to consider invoking a minimum
                        imprisonment of three years not exceeding five years,
                        and a minimum caning of two strokes, whether there is

                        various offences. We have, like I said, drafted the
                        provisions very carefully, calibrated, poised, quite

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My second point concerns the mandatory jail terms that
                        individuals face. Although a mandatory jail term serves
                        as a much higher deterrent to possible offenders, it
                        also ties the hands of judges during sentencing,
                        especially when considering mitigating factors.
                            <em>Some of these mitigating factors
                            may be strong; for example, it is not unheard of for
                            people in debt to these loansharks to be forced into
                            working for them. This is especially so, given the
                            ruthlessness of these loansharks, if these people
                            break the law in fear for their lives or the lives
                            of their loved ones. Judges should be allowed to
                            consider these factors when sentencing offenders and
                            a mandatory jail sentence may be too
                            harsh</em> especially in cases where the
                        perpetrators offend under threat or fear for their
                        lives. Will the Minister consider raising the jail terms
                        whilst not making it mandatory? In this way, the
                        deterrent is still increased, without restricting judges
                        when considering mitigating factors. [emphasis

                    Cheng’s proposal, Assoc Prof Ho shared MP Calvin
                    Cheng’s concern about inflexibility (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On mandatory punishment – I think this is the
                        point that Mr Calvin Cheng has made – whether
                        mandatory punishment will put a fetter on the
                        Court’s discretion in sentencing. Actually,
                        mandatory punishment, for example, mandatory
                        imprisonment, it means that the Court has to jail a
                        person. But within that power, there is a range where
                        the Court can jail a person either for “x”
                        years or “x plus y” years. In that sense,
                        the Court will still have some discretion, taking into
                        account the mitigating circumstances of the case ...
                        Whether it removes the Court’s ability to take
                        into account mitigating circumstances, the answer will
                        be no, because still the Court can consider that. Many
                        MPs, in fact, have highlighted the fact that we have
                        imposed minimum mandatory punishment. I think as this
                        House knows, we do not do that lightly as a government.
                        We do it when the situation warrants it. And that is why
                        at this point in time when we have to send a strong
                        message, we have included some mandatory minimum
                        punishment in the Bill, I am sure the message will sink
                        in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In applying these
                    “tough laws”, the courts must be careful to
                    uphold the deterrence objectives that Parliament had in mind
                    when enacting the severe mandatory minimum punishments. But
                    the courts must also apply the law sensitively, keeping in
                    mind the intricate context in which deterrence works and the
                    deliberate decision Parliament made to grant the courts some
                    leeway in sentencing. A nuanced approach is called for, and
                    unintended distortions in the ecosystem of measures
                    Parliament has structured should be avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     A key feature in the
                    administration of criminal justice is that, within the range
                    or confines of the criminal sanctions prescribed by law for
                    an offence, the punishment imposed should fit the crime and
                    the criminal. Hence even in a case like the present, where
                    the legislature has unequivocally declared war on loan shark
                    offences, unrelenting deterrence does <em>not</em> mean indiscriminate deterrence. As the
                    court very aptly remarked in <em>Tan Kay Beng
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 10 (at [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Deterrence must always be tempered
                            by proportionality in relation to the severity of
                            the offence committed as well as by the moral and
                            legal culpability of the offender. It is axiomatic
                            that a court must abstain from gratuitous loading in
                            sentences</em>. Deterrence, as a concept, has
                        a multi-faceted dimension and it is inappropriate to
                        invoke it without a proper appreciation of how and when
                        it should be applied. It is premised upon the upholding
                        of certain statutory or public policy concerns or
                        alternatively, upon judicial concern or disquiet about
                        the prevalence of particular offences and the attendant
                        need to prevent such offences from becoming contagious.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similar sentiments were recently expressed by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684
                        (“<em>PP v Kwong Kok
                        Hing</em>”) (at [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where in relation to a particular offence the court is
                        given a wide discretion in terms of the punishment it
                        may impose, it is critical that it exercises that
                        discretion, as far as possible, in a manner that remains
                        faithful to two essential principles: (a) that the
                        punishment fits the crime, having regard to the
                        circumstances attending the case before the court; and
                        (b) that like cases be treated alike ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The principle of tailoring
                    the punishment to the crime and the criminal also extends to
                    the use of benchmark sentences. Benchmarks usually arise
                    from the steady accretion of the decisions of the courts.
                    They are the result of the practical application of
                    statutory penal laws, but should not be mistaken for those
                    laws themselves. Benchmarks play a crucial role in achieving
                    some measure of consistency of punishment. But the principle
                    of treating like cases alike also means that unlike cases
                    should <em>not</em> be treated alike.
                    The court must resist an unhesitating application of
                    benchmark sentences without first thoroughly considering if
                    the particular factual circumstances of a case fall within
                    the reasonable parameters of the benchmark case. Ultimately,
                    where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences,
                    it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum
                    is carefully explored in determining the appropriate
                    sentence. Where benchmarks harden into rigid formulae which
                    suggest that only a segment of the possible sentencing range
                    should be applied by the court, there is a risk that the
                    court might inadvertently usurp the legislative
                    function.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At this juncture, I will
                    pause to remind myself of the trite principle that an
                    appellate court should interfere with a sentence meted out
                    by the trial judge only if it is satisfied that (see

                        manifestly excessive or manifestly
                    inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The District Court’s approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is clear from the
                    Grounds of Decision (“the GD”) that the
                    District Judge treated the principle of deterrence as the
                    main, if not the sole consideration. There was at best only
                    a cursory evaluation of the appellant’s mitigating
                    factors. At the urging of the Prosecution, the District
                    Judge also placed primary emphasis on the number of charges
                    that the accused faced. In reaching his sentence, the
                    District Judge referred to two cases in particular (see
                        [23]–[24] of the GD). The first was that of
                        <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em> (cited
                    at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), which
                    was a Magistrate’s Appeal to the High Court. In that
                    case the High Court laid down benchmark imprisonment
                    sentences for fire and non-fire harassment offences: 18
                    months and 12 months respectively. In <em>PP
                        v Nelson Jeyaraj</em>, the accused had borrowed
                    from loan sharks to start a business. He could not repay the
                    loan and so began to work for the loan sharks for money. He
                    started work as a runner who verified that others had
                    carried out their acts of harassment. After awhile, he
                    “upgraded” himself and voluntarily took on
                    harassment jobs because they paid better. There was no
                    indication that he was driven to harassment after having
                    taken reasonable steps to service his loan. Neither had he
                    sought to minimise the damage that his harassment caused.
                    Unlike the appellant in the present case, he used highly
                    flammable kerosene as fuel to light the fires, which caused
                    extensive damage. They spread to the ceiling, melting the
                    ceiling lamps and the insulation of electrical wirings in
                    the common corridor. In one instance, the fire had even
                    spread close to the gas tanks. He had a long list of
                    antecedents. He pleaded guilty to six charges, of which five
                    were for fire harassment. He was sentenced to 18
                    months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for
                    each fire harassment charge, with three of them ordered to
                    run consecutively. The total sentence was 54 months’
                    imprisonment, 15 strokes of the cane, and a $30,000
                    fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The second case that the
                    District Judge referred to was that of <em>Public Prosecutor v Soh Hann </em><em>Kwang</em> (DAC 20162/11 and others,
                    unreported) (“<em>PP v Soh Hann
                        </em><em>Kwang</em>”).
                    The accused pleaded guilty to 11 harassment charges (of
                    which seven were by fire) with 20 more taken into
                    consideration. In a departure from the benchmark laid down
                    by <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em>, the
                    accused was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and
                    three strokes of the cane for each charge of fire
                    harassment. He received 12 months’ imprisonment and
                    three strokes of the cane for each charge of paint
                    harassment. Three fire harassment charges and one paint
                    harassment charge were ordered to run consecutively. The
                    total sentence was 84 months’ imprisonment and 24
                    strokes of the cane. The decision is unreported and so
                    nothing is known as to the facts of the case, or why the
                    District Judge there departed from the 18 months benchmark
                    set in <em>PP v Nelson
                    Jeyaraj</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Prosecution in the
                    present case also referred to <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Goh Kim Leong Jeffrey</em> (DAC
                    17821/11 and others, unreported) (“<em>PP v Goh Kim Leong Jeffrey</em>”). The
                    accused was a debtor turned harasser. He wrote
                    “O$P$” on walls, set main doors on fire,
                    splashed paint at homes, and splashed paint remover on cars.
                    He was a first time offender, but faced a total of 50
                    charges of harassment. The Prosecution proceeded on 15, with
                    the remainder being taken into consideration. He was
                    sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment and three strokes
                    of the cane for each fire harassment charge, and 12
                    months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for
                    each paint harassment charge. The sentences for three fire
                    harassment charges and one paint harassment charge were
                    ordered to run consecutively, for a total of 75
                    months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. Like
                        <em>PP v Soh Hann </em><em>Kwang</em>, the case was unreported so
                    even the age of the offender is unknown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In my view, the District
                    Judge’s single-minded focus on deterrence led to an
                    insufficient appreciation of Parliament’s nuanced
                    approach towards loan shark offences. It also led him to
                    place too much weight on the number of offences <em>per se</em> that the appellant faced,
                    without regard to the other circumstances which are
                    addressed at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The number of charges tells only a part of the
                story</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The number of charges does
                    not explain how or why the offender committed those crimes.
                    But as explained above, those are issues that also mattered
                    to Parliament. In the present appeal, the number of charges
                    alone did not reveal that the appellant fell into the
                    category of vulnerable people for whom sympathy had been
                    expressed in Parliament. The appellant had been a law
                    abiding citizen. He got into trouble because he foolishly
                    guaranteed a friend’s loan and later got retrenched.
                    Even after half a year, his efforts to find a new job were
                    unsuccessful. He began to borrow from new loan sharks to
                    service his existing debts. He tried his best to repay the
                    loan, even going to the extent of selling his HDB flat, but
                    it was not enough. It was in these circumstances that he was
                    pushed towards crime. The matrix of facts within which the
                    appellant committed the harassment is patently different
                    from that in <em>PP v Nelson
                        Jeyaraj</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The number of charges
                        <em>per se</em> is also an
                    imprecise indicator of moral culpability. As described above
                    (at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>), the appellant
                    took some steps to minimise the damage done by him, whether
                    it was harassment by fire or by paint. This is in stark
                    contrast to the damage wrought by the accused in <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em>, which evidenced
                    a total lack of concern about the consequences of his crimes
                    or the safety of the debtors. At the appeal, the Prosecution
                    did not question that the appellant had used Zippo lighter
                    fluid instead of kerosene to light the fires. But it
                    challenged the appellant’s claim that he had diluted
                    the paint and splashed only a small amount so as to reduce
                    the damage. This scepticism was based on its view that
                    “acts of harassment are counter-checked by other
                    runners to ensure that the job is done”. This was a
                    new objection which had not been made by the Prosecution at
                    the District Court. In any event, it was not disputed that
                    in respect of the instances involving harassment by fire,
                    little damage was caused to the target. As I see it, this is
                    proof that the appellant had been concerned about reducing
                    the damage caused by his acts of harassment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The number of charges
                    tells only a part of the story of a complex crime. They may
                    be a sign of hardened criminality, or equally a sign of
                    desperation – of someone who for fear of his own
                    safety or for that of his family members, felt unable to
                    resist doing the biddings of the loan sharks. Such
                    statistics, while relevant, cannot be viewed in isolation.
                    Take the case of <em>PP v Soh Hann
                        </em><em>Kwang</em>, which
                    the Prosecution placed heavy reliance upon in this appeal.
                    All the court knows about <em>PP v Soh Hann
                        </em><em>Kwang</em> is that
                    the accused in that case faced 31 charges of harassment, of
                    which at least seven were for fire. He was sentenced to 24
                    months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for
                    each fire harassment offence, and received a total of 84
                    months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. But
                    this court knows nothing about the circumstances in which
                    those offences were committed or the extent of the fire
                    damage. Curiously enough, the appellant revealed to this
                    court during the hearing of the appeal that, in an
                    interesting quirk of chance, he happened to be in the same
                    holding cell as Soh Hann Kwang while he was in remand.
                    According to the appellant, Soh Hann Kwang boasted that he
                    had splashed an entire one litre can of pure paint on each
                    of the victims’ doors. More alarmingly, he had
                    allegedly mixed a litre of kerosene with a litre of thinner
                    as fuel for the fires he lit. The fires predictably raged,
                    in some cases causing the gate to melt off its hinges. Now
                        <em>if</em> those were indeed the
                    facts of <em>PP v Soh Hann
                        </em><em>Kwang</em>, then one
                    begins to see the justification for the sentences imposed on
                    him. But since the appellant’s evidence in this regard
                    is clearly hearsay, this court has nothing on which to
                    evaluate the precedent value of <em>PP v Soh
                        Hann </em><em>Kwang</em> or
                        <em>PP v Goh Kim Leong
                    Jeffrey</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The courts have previously
                    remarked upon the limited precedent value of unreported
                    cases, a warning which seemed to have been overlooked by the
                    District Judge and the Prosecution in the present case. As
                    the Chief Justice said in <em>Luong
                        </em><em>Thi </em><em>Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 1 SLR 707 (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Prosecution’s … case authorities were
                        all unreported cases in which no written grounds of
                        decision were given to explain the sentences imposed
                        … I would first caution against relying on
                            <em>unreported</em> decisions
                        indiscriminately in determining the appropriate sentence
                        for the particular case before the court. The dangers of
                        doing so are clear. In <em>Tay Kim Kuan v
                            PP</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 876, this
                        court cautioned at [6] that unreported cases were only
                        guidelines since “the detailed facts and
                        circumstances of these cases [were] hardly disclosed or
                        documented with sufficient clarity to enable any
                        intelligent comparison to be made”. Comparisons
                        based on unreported decisions are difficult and are
                            “<em>likely to be
                            misleading</em> because a proper appraisal of
                        the particular facts and circumstances is simply
                        lacking” … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Remorse</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In addition to placing
                    undue weight on the number of charges against the accused,
                    the District Judge appeared not to have adequately
                    considered the appellant’s remorse. It is not disputed
                    that at the time of the appellant’s arrest, the Police
                    were able to connect the appellant to fewer than five
                    charges. It was the appellant who voluntarily confessed to
                    the other charges, in effect building the
                    Prosecution’s case against himself. The
                    appellant’s reason for confessing was that he was very
                    much in a dilemma even while committing those offences. He
                    was motivated by a wish to help his victims achieve some
                    form of closure in knowing that the person who harassed
                    their homes had been caught. In my view, the
                    appellant’s confession to not just one or two more
                    instances of harassments, but almost 70 instances is a
                    definite and concrete manifestation of his remorse. There is
                    a public interest in encouraging a guilty person to come
                    forward to disclose the facts of the offence that he has
                    committed, and to confess his guilt: <em>Public Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 611 at [21]. It is all the more in the public
                    interest to have accused persons disclose other offences
                    which they had committed, but which the Police are unaware
                    of. No weight was given to this by the District Judge. I
                    would emphasise that one should not merely focus on numbers
                    alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is a settled principle
                    of sentencing that true remorse is a mitigating factor. As
                    this court held in the Magistrate’s Appeal of
                        <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 (at
                    [77]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A plea of guilt can be taken into
                        consideration in mitigation when it is motivated by
                        genuine remorse, contriteness or regret and/or a desire
                        to facilitate the administration of justice. The
                        mitigating effect should also be compatible with the
                        sentencing purpose(s) and principles the sentencing
                        judge is seeking to achieve and observe through the
                        sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The fact that the appellant came clean and bared
                    his misdeeds demonstrated his genuine remorse. That was a
                    mitigating factor that the District Judge should have more
                    carefully appraised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Parliament has singled out
                    people in the same vulnerable category as the appellant as
                    deserving of compassion. The provisions of the law under
                    which the appellant has been charged also give the courts a
                    reasonably wide discretion to take into account mitigating
                    factors in deserving cases. It seems to me that in many ways
                    the appellant was a victim of circumstances spiralling
                    beyond his control. Not being in his shoes, non-parties are
                    unlikely to know the pressures that pushed him towards
                    crime. I have noted that while it is Parliament’s
                    intent that he should still be punished severely, the real
                    question is whether the extent of punishment ought in the
                    present case to be leavened with some compassion. Deterrence
                    should not be indiscriminate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The recent case of
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Chiah
                        </em><em>Khing</em> [2012]
                    SGDC 35 may be an example of a more sensitive and nuanced
                    application of deterrence. The accused there was charged
                    with one charge of paint harassment, and one charge of
                    assisting with unlicensed moneylending. He was a 51 year old
                    man in poor health. His highest level of education was
                    primary six. He lived with his aged and sick father. He had
                    been retrenched repeatedly from his menial jobs and had been
                    looking for employment when he was introduced to a loan
                    shark who offered him $1,600 a month just to insert notes
                    into debtors’ letter boxes. Having reeled the accused
                    in, the loan shark proceeded to manipulate him by gradually
                    increasing the severity of the tasks demanded. One month
                    after he began work, the accused was asked to splash paint
                    on debtors’ homes. He was caught after his first act
                    of harassment. The district judge considered all the factors
                    and noted that the benchmark laid down in <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em> was not intended to be a
                    hard and fast rule. He noted the accused’s plight at
                    that time and decided that six months’ imprisonment
                    and three strokes of the cane was an appropriate punishment
                    on the facts of the case. The Prosecution’s appeal
                    against sentence was dismissed. There is no doubt that the
                    accused in that case came from the more vulnerable stratum
                    of society. The case shows that the courts will go below the
                    benchmarks where they find it appropriate and just to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Returning to the present
                    appeal, I see no justification to impose 24 months’
                    imprisonment for each of the fire harassment offences. The
                    damage caused was much less extensive, and was in fact
                    minimal when compared to that caused in <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em>. This was because the
                    appellant deliberately used a less flammable fuel and took
                    steps to minimise the spread of the fire. I am unimpressed
                    by the Prosecution’s contention before me that the 48
                    other charges to be taken into consideration were in
                    themselves a sufficient ground to increase the severity of
                    punishment for the individual charges of fire harassment. As
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v UI</em>
                    (at [37]–[38]) held, the relevance of outstanding
                    charges that are taken into consideration hinges on the
                    context. Given that none of the outstanding charges related
                    to fire harassment, I felt they were more relevant as an
                    aggravating factor in relation to the paint harassment
                    charges. Not only is there no reason to impose a higher
                    penalty than the benchmark set in <em>PP v
                        Nelson Jeyaraj</em> for each of the fire
                    harassment offences, I also find that the sentences should
                    be reduced. I accordingly reduce the sentence for each of
                    the fire harassment charges to 16 months’
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Similarly, I am of the
                    view that a discount ought to have been given by the
                    District Judge for the charges that dealt only with the
                    splashing of paint and the writing on the walls. This is to
                    reflect the steps that the appellant took to minimize the
                    damage caused to the property. However, sentencing is not a
                    precise science. A small discount of one to two months,
                    after taking into consideration the outstanding charges,
                    will in any event not greatly affect the global sentence to
                    be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In determining the
                    aggregate sentence, I kept in mind the totality principle
                    approved in <em>Kanagasuntharam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 874 at
                        [13]. The total
                    sentence should not be much higher than the normal level of
                    sentence for the most serious of the individual offences.
                    Neither should the total sentence be crushing. I was also
                    mindful, having already taken into consideration the
                    outstanding charges when determining the individual
                    sentences, not to double-load the punishment by taking
                    additional account of them in determining the global
                    sentence. Like the District Judge I order that three
                    sentences for fire harassment and one sentence for paint
                    harassment are to run consecutively. The total sentence is
                    hence 60 months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the
                    cane. This is still longer than the sentence imposed in
                        <em>PP v Nelson Jeyaraj</em>. While
                    it is true that that case involved fewer charges, there are
                    stronger mitigating factors here. I have discussed those
                    factors in full above, and will merely summarise here some
                    of the more salient ones:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellant
                        was a law abiding citizen who became involved with loan
                        sharks only because he wanted to help a friend by
                        guaranteeing the latter’s loan: see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant took reasonable steps
                        to pay the loan sharks, even going to the extent of
                        selling his HDB flat. But his retrenchment and inability
                        to find a new job meant that his debts kept mounting:
                        see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appellant took steps to minimise
                        the damage caused by his acts of harassment: see
                            <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     The appellant confessed to the great
                        bulk of charges that were brought against him, and which
                        the police would otherwise have been unable to pin on
                        him. He did so because he wanted the victims to attain
                        some form of closure. This was a concrete manifestation
                        of remorse: see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                        and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>
                        above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It seems to me that the
                    appellant was a family man who never wanted to fall foul of
                    the law. Through an act of kindness to a friend, who turned
                    out to be wholly unworthy, coupled with the misfortune of
                    losing his job, he found himself more deeply entangled with
                    the law with each day that he did the biddings of the loan
                    sharks. In the interests of the public and as a general
                    deterrence, he should of course be punished severely but he
                    should not be crushed. By no stretch of the imagination can
                    it be said that a punishment of 60 months’
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane (the maximum
                    permitted by law) for the appellant’s wrongdoings is
                    an insufficient deterrent, either to him or to
                    others.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The appeal is therefore
                    allowed. The appellant’s sentence is reduced to 60
                    months’ imprisonment. The 24 strokes of the cane and
                    fine of $30,000 shall remain.</p>
