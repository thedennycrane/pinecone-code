<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Wong Hua Choon (“the
                    defendant”) against the decision of the learned assistant registrar
                    (“AR”) in Summons No 749 of 2010, in which the latter
                    declined to order a stay of the present proceedings commenced by OCBC Capital
                    Investment Asia Ltd (“OCIA”) against the defendant in favour of
                    the courts of Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       OCIA is an investment company incorporated in
                    Hong Kong. It is part of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation group of
                    companies (“the OCBC Group”) and has business operations in
                    Singapore and Malaysia, <em>inter alia</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is a Singapore permanent resident
                    and was, at all material times, a substantial shareholder, president and chief
                    executive officer of Frontken Corporation Berhad (“Frontken”).
                    Frontken is a public company incorporated in Malaysia and its shares are listed
                    on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In June 2007, the defendant approached OCIA to
                    participate in a placement exercise in respect of new shares in Frontken. To
                    induce OCIA to do so, the defendant entered into a Risk Participation Agreement
                    (“RPA”) in his personal capacity with OCIA whereby he undertook to
                    underwrite the downside risk of any fluctuation in the value of the Frontken
                    shares placed out to OCIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The effect of the RPA was that if OCIA sold any
                    of its shares in Frontken within a stipulated six-month period (“the Risk
                    Participation Period”) at a price that was below a stipulated
                    “floor price”, the defendant would be liable to OCIA in respect of
                    such shortfall (“the Risk Participation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       OCIA invested approximately RM15m in the
                    placement exercise and received a total of 27,630 shares in Frontken. The
                    original Risk Participation Period was to be from 10 February 2009 to
                    10 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In or around February 2009 (long before the RPA
                    was due to expire), OCIA decided to dispose of all its Frontken shares and to
                    look to the defendant for Risk Participation pursuant to the terms of the RPA.
                    This intention was verbally communicated to the defendant during a meeting on 10
                    February 2009. OCIA also asked the defendant whether he would buy the shares
                    since he had a right of first refusal to the same under the RPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The parties discussed a proposed purchase by the
                    defendant of part of the Frontken shares held by OCIA, coupled with an extension
                    of the Risk Participation Period in respect of any remaining shares that were
                    not sold to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 16 June 2009, OCIA forwarded a term
                    sheet setting out those proposals to the defendant and arranged for a meeting in
                    Singapore on 23 June 2009 to discuss the same. At the meeting with the
                    defendant, which was also attended by the defendant’s assistant Nicholas
                    Ng, the defendant gave his verbal acceptance of the terms thereof and his
                    acceptance was further confirmed in an e-mail sent out the following day by the
                    said Nicholas Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In reliance on the defendant’s
                    acceptance of the term sheet, OCIA refrained from selling its shares in Frontken
                    within the original Risk Participation Period and claiming the resulting Risk
                    Participation from the defendant. This was because the term sheet placed a
                    moratorium on OCIA claiming any Risk Participation before 1 July 2010
                    whilst extending the Risk Participation Period indefinitely for as long as OCIA
                    held any of the placement shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, after all the relevant formal
                    documentation had been prepared, the defendant refused to follow through with
                    signing of the agreement. Repeated requests to the defendant to execute the
                    agreement were futile. OCIA therefore instituted Suit No 63 of 2010
                    (“Suit No 63”) against the defendant on 29 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OCIA’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     By its action in Suit No 63, OCIA
                    asserted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     that a binding oral agreement on the
                        terms of the term sheet had been reached between the parties pursuant to the
                        meeting held on 23 June 2009 in Singapore; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     alternatively, that the parties had a
                        common understanding that the Risk Participation Period would be extended
                        until the formal documentation in respect of the term sheet was executed,
                        and that the defendant was estopped from asserting
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">OCIA therefore sought declaratory relief to that
                    effect and further consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defendant’s stay application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 19 February 2010, the defendant filed
                    Summons No 749 of 2010 applying for a stay of the present action in favour
                    of the courts of Malaysia. This was heard by the AR on 7 April 2010 and the
                    stay of proceedings was subsequently refused. The defendant’s appeal
                    against the AR’s decision then came before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable clause of the RPA in relation to the substantive
                dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Clause 9.5 of the RPA provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    This Agreement and the rights and duties of the
                            parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in
                            accordance with, the laws of Malaysia and in relation to any legal
                            action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
                            Agreement (‘Proceedings’), the parties irrevocably submits
                                [<em>sic</em>] to the non-exclusive
                            jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia, and waive any objections to
                            Proceedings in any court on the grounds that the Proceedings have been
                            brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Such submission shall however not affect the right
                            of OCIA to take Proceedings in any other jurisdiction nor shall the
                            taking of Proceedings in any jurisdiction preclude OCIA from taking
                            Proceedings in any other jurisdiction and OCIA shall be at liberty to
                            initiate and take actions or Proceedings or otherwise against [the
                            defendant] in Malaysia and/or elsewhere as OCIA may deem
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant submits that a stay ought to be
                    granted in the circumstances of this case in favour of the courts of Malaysia on
                    the ground that the Singapore court is <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The interpretation of cl 9.5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On behalf of OCIA, it was argued that,
                    although under cl 9.5(a) the parties submitted to the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia, under cl 9.5(b) OCIA had the right
                    to commence proceedings in any other jurisdiction. On a plain reading, this much
                    was indisputable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Counsel for OCIA then further argued that the
                    waiver of objection in cl 9.5(a) was not limited to the Malaysian
                    courts’ jurisdiction but applied with respect to the jurisdiction of any
                    court in which proceedings were brought by either party. On that basis OCIA
                    applied the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <em>Bambang
                        Sutrisno v Bali International Finance Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R)
                    632 (“<em>Bambang</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Bambang</em>, the
                    parties had entered into an agreement to submit to the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the Indonesian courts and the agreement further contained a
                    waiver of objection on the ground of venue or <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. The waiver of objection clause was interpreted widely
                    to cover objections on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> with respect to any court, and not just those of
                    Indonesia. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant was in
                    breach of that agreement by having applied for a stay of proceedings on the
                    ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> and that,
                    therefore, the court would refuse a stay and give effect to the agreement
                    between the parties unless exceptional circumstances amounting to strong cause
                    was shown by the defendant for a stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Counsel for OCIA contended that similarly in
                    the present circumstances, the defendant was required to show exceptional
                    circumstances amounting to “strong cause” why the stay of the
                    Singapore proceedings ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On the other hand, the defendant’s
                    contention was that the waiver of objection in cl 9.5(a) applied only with
                    respect to the jurisdiction of the Malaysian courts. It followed that there was
                    no agreement precluding the defendant from objecting to OCIA’s choice of
                    Singapore jurisdiction on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I favour the latter interpretation for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The juxtaposition of the waiver of
                        objection in the very sentence in cl 9.5(a) by which the parties agree
                        to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia strongly
                        suggests that it applies only to cl 9.5(a) and not to
                    cl9.5(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Although
                        OCIA argued that the phrase “Proceedings in any court” in cl
                        9.5(a) meant that the waiver could apply to proceedings in any <em>jurisdiction</em>, the phrase more likely means
                        “Proceedings in any <em>court</em>”
                        <em>in Malaysia</em>. Had the parties intended the
                        waiver to apply to Proceedings in any “jurisdiction”, they
                        would have used that word instead of “court”. Significantly,
                        in cl 9.5(b) the expression employed is “Proceedings in any
                        other jurisdiction” lending support to the view that the word
                        “court” was used advisedly in
                    cl 9.5(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It follows that although OCIA had the right
                    under cl 9.5(b) to take proceedings in Singapore, the defendant did not
                    waive the right to object to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction on the
                    ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In seeking to
                    object to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction, it would not be acting in
                    breach of any waiver of objection. Accordingly, the test is not whether the
                    defendant has shown strong cause for a stay as in <em>Bambang</em> (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>), but whether, according to <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987]
                    AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”), the
                    defendant has shown that the Malaysian court is clearly or distinctly more
                    appropriate than the Singapore court for the trial of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate test in determining <em>forum non
                    conveniens</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Prior to <em>Spiliada</em>, the basic principle appeared to be that a stay would
                    only be granted on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> where the court was satisfied that there was some
                    other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which was the appropriate
                    forum for the trial of the action, <em>ie</em>, in which
                    the case might be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and
                    the ends of justice. However the House of Lords in <em>Spiliada</em> decided that that principle gave too large a prominence
                    to the “legitimate personal or juridical advantage” to the
                    plaintiff in the continuance of the proceedings (see: Dicey, Morris and Collins
                    on <em>The Conflict of Laws</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    14th Ed, 2006) at para 12–010 (“<em>Dicey, Morris and Collins”</em>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Lord Goff of Chieveley in <em>Spiliada</em> held that the burden resting on the defendant
                    is not just to show that the present forum is not the natural or appropriate
                    forum for the trial, but to establish that there is another available forum
                    which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the present forum (see
                        <em>Spiliada</em> at 477).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Thus the test which is elucidated in <em>Spiliada</em> is twofold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant must show that there
                        is another court with competent jurisdiction which is clearly or distinctly
                        more appropriate than the present forum for the trial of the action; and
                        that</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     it is not
                        unjust that the plaintiff be deprived of the right to trial in the present
                        forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">(See rule 31(2) in <em>Dicey, Morris
                            and Collins</em> at para 12R–001.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The test as laid down directed the enquiry
                    into whether a particular court was clearly more appropriate than another, and
                    not to a search for the “natural forum” as such (see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins</em>, at
                    para 12–005).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The key question is not one of convenience
                    but, rather, is of the suitability or appropriateness of the relevant
                    jurisdiction (see <em>Spiliada</em> at 474). It was decided
                    in <em>Clements v Macaulay</em> [1866] 4 Macph 583
                    Scot that the true object of the doctrine was to find the forum which was the
                    most suitable for the ends of justice and was preferable because pursuit of the
                    litigation in that forum was more likely to secure those ends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Under the first limb of the test, the
                    defendant would need to show factors which point to another forum that is
                    clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action. This would be a forum with
                    which the action had “the most real and substantial connection”
                        (<em>Spiliada</em> at 478).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Factors such as those affecting convenience or
                    expense, governing law, as well as the places where the parties respectively
                    reside or carry on business would be of assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the defendant should be allowed a stay of
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On a balance of factors, it is thus necessary
                    to decide if the defendant has discharged his burden of proving that Malaysia is
                        <em>prima facie</em> clearly and distinctly a more
                    appropriate forum for the action to take place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It should be noted that in weighing the
                    balance of convenience under the doctrine of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>, the process should not be a mechanical one (see
                        <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von
                        Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377) and this was elucidated by V K
                    Rajah J in <em>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek
                        Lian</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 381 where at [20] he held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court has to take into account an entire multitude of factors in
                        balancing the competing interests. The weightage accorded to a particular
                        factor varies in different cases and the ultimate appraisal ought to reflect
                        the exigencies dictated by the factual matrix. Copious citations of
                        precedents and <em>dicta</em> are usually of little
                        assistance and may in reality serve to cloud rather than elucidate the
                        applicable principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Further, in the case of <em>Andre Ravindran S Arul v Tunku Ibrahim Ismail bin Sultan Iskandar
                        Al-Haj</em> [2001] SGHC 209, Choo Han Teck JC held that the
                    determination of the appropriate forum is not an exercise carried out merely by
                    adding the sum total of all the relevant connecting factors and that the court
                    has to apportion a value to each factor and consider its place in the overall
                    picture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant submits that his strongest
                    grounds as to why Malaysia has a closer and more substantial connection to the
                    action, and therefore is a more appropriate forum, are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     the governing law is that of
                        Malaysia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     there
                        was an express choice of Malaysia as a non-exclusive jurisdiction;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        witnesses are mostly in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I shall now look at
                    these factors in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Governing law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is undisputed that the RPA stipulates the
                    governing law as that of Malaysia and that the basic rule is that a contract is
                    governed by the law chosen by the parties (see <em>James Miller
                        &amp; Partners Ltd v Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd</em>
                    [1970] AC 583). Nevertheless, <em>Dicey, Morris &amp;
                        Collins</em> at p 478, para 12–029 states that where
                    legal issues are straightforward, or if the competing fora have domestic laws
                    which are substantially similar, the identity of the governing law will be a
                    factor of rather little significance (see <em>Marconi
                        Communications International Ltd v PT Pan Indonesia Bank Ltd TBK</em>
                    [2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 594 at [36] and <em>Navigators
                        Insurance Co Ltd v Atlantic Methanol Production Co LLC</em> [2004]
                    Lloyd’s Rep IR 418 at [48] where this statement of principle was
                    accepted by David Steel J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Further, in <em>Amerco Timbers
                        Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd</em> [1977–1978]
                    SLR(R) 112, it was stated that there was no evidence before the court that
                    Indonesian law differed from Singapore law in any significant respect concerning
                    matters relating to the claim or that there was likely to be any serious dispute
                    on the application of Indonesian law to the issues in the case. In addition, it
                    was highlighted that there was no material to show that a Singapore court would
                    have any difficulty in applying Indonesian law should the need arise, and thus
                    that the court would attach little weight to this factor. This was also
                    reiterated in the case of <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Keinwort
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>Dresdner</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In addition, in <em>Malayan
                        Banking Berhad v Measurex Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 5
                        (“<em>Malayan Banking Berhad</em>”), it
                    was decided that there was no material difference between Malaysian law and
                    Singapore law on guarantees and contracts, and that even if there was such a
                    difference, there was no reason why the Singapore courts would not be able to
                    apply Malaysian law. Thus, the chosen applicable law had little
                    significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It could be said that Malaysian and Singapore
                    law are ultimately very much similar in respect of the subject matter which
                    arises in the present case, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether a binding contract had been
                        formed between OCIA and the defendant as per the terms of the term sheet and
                        the effect of the same on the defendant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the defendant was estopped in the
                        circumstances from denying that the Risk Participation Period had been
                        extended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Further, the opinion of a Malaysian counsel,
                    furnished as expert evidence by OCIA, was that with respect to the issues in
                    question, the law in Malaysia followed principles of English common law as (I
                    note) does Singapore law. In such a situation, the Singapore court would be able
                    to apply Malaysian law without the aid of foreign experts and there would
                    neither be unnecessary expense nor inconvenience. Therefore, following the same
                    reasoning as in <em>Malayan Banking Berhad</em>, the choice
                    of Malaysian law as the governing law in the present instance would be of little
                    significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defendant’s counsel argued that this
                    reasoning should only apply where there was already a preponderance of factors
                    (except for the governing law) in favour of the jurisdiction where the action
                    was commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I find no merit in this argument. The
                    reasoning was brought up in <em>Dresdner</em> (<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> <em>supra</em>) as a counter to the applicable law factor,
                    rather than merely as a tipping point added on to a preponderance of factors in
                    the application of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Choice of non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Malaysian
                courts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the case of <em>Bambang</em> (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>), it was held that the court should give
                    some weight to the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Indonesian
                    court even though it was not exclusive and gave a right to the parties to
                    institute proceedings in any other jurisdiction they may deem fit. This was so
                    as it indicated that the parties considered the Indonesian court to be an
                    appropriate forum for the hearing of their dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Court of Appeal approved a statement by
                    Lai Siu Chiu J in <em>PT Jaya Putra Kundur Indah v Guthrie
                        Overseas Investments Pte Ltd</em> [1996] SGHC 285
                        (“<em>Guthrie</em>”) in which the learned
                    judge held at [64]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in my opinion, the presence of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause
                        specifically choosing Indonesia as a forum for trial of the action showed
                        that, <em>prima facie</em>, the parties had agreed that
                        Indonesia would be an appropriate forum for the trial of the action than
                        elsewhere. Jurisdiction agreements, though they may be non-exclusive in
                        nature, should be respected and, when possible, upheld. Of course, there may
                        be other fori in which an action concerning a breach of the 1st JVA may be
                        brought, but Indonesia would clearly be an appropriate forum for the trial
                        of an action arising out of a breach of the 1st JVA. So the parties have
                        agreed. <b>The plaintiffs should not be heard to argue that
                            Indonesia would not be appropriate forum for the trial of this
                            action</b>. ... [emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge had relied on two passages in the judgment of
                    Hobhouse J in <em>S &amp; W Berisford Plc v New
                        Hampshire Insurance Co</em> [1990] 2 QB 631. In that case,
                    Hobhouse J said at 638:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I conclude that this clause is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause.
                        As I pointed out in <em>Cannon Screen Entertainment Ltd v
                            Handmade Films (Distributors) Ltd</em> [[1989] BCLC 660;
                        5 BCC 207] such a conclusion does not mean that the cause ceases to be
                        relevant in relation to an application such as that which is being made by
                        the defendants on this summons. If the contract says that the assured is
                        entitled to sue the underwriter in the English courts, then <b>it requires a strong case for the courts of this country to say
                            that that right shall not be recognised and that he must sue
                            elsewhere</b>. ... [emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He later said at 646:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s pointed out in <em>Cannon Screen Entertainment Ltd v
                            Handmade Films (Distributors) Ltd</em>, 11 July 1989, the
                        fact that the parties have agreed in their contract that the English courts
                        shall have jurisdiction (albeit a non-exclusive jurisdiction) creates a
                        strong <em>prima facie</em> case that that jurisdiction
                        is an appropriate one; <b>it should in principle be a
                            jurisdiction to which neither party to the contract can object as
                            inappropriate</b>; they have both implicitly agreed that it is
                        appropriate. [emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It will be observed that in each of the
                    authorities, the court was merely saying that where the parties had agreed that
                    a particular forum was to have non-exclusive jurisdiction, one party cannot be
                    heard to argue that that forum was inappropriate. Thus in <em>Guthrie</em>, the key sentence in the passage quoted from
                    Lai J’s judgment was: “The plaintiffs should not be heard to
                    argue that Indonesia would not be appropriate forum for the trial of this
                    action.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Likewise, in Hobhouse J’s judgment,
                    the key sentence is that in which the learned judge said at 646:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the fact that the parties have agreed in their contract that the
                        English courts shall have jurisdiction (albeit a non-exclusive jurisdiction)
                        creates a strong <em>prima facie</em> case that that
                        jurisdiction is an appropriate one; <b>it should in
                            principle be a jurisdiction to which neither party to the contract can
                            object as inappropriate</b>; they have both implicitly agreed
                        that it is appropriate. [emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These were the statements the Court of Appeal was expressly or
                    implicitly agreeing to when it said that some weight had to be accorded to the
                    selection of the Indonesian court as the forum for the determination of the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, there is no dispute in the present
                    matter that the Malaysian court would be an appropriate forum. Rather, the
                    question is whether it would be clearly or distinctly a <em>more</em> appropriate forum than the Singapore court for hearing the
                    matter. While the parties submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    Malaysian court in cl 9.5(a), the legal consequence would merely be that
                    the Malaysian court is <em>an</em> appropriate forum,
                    rather than <em>the</em> only appropriate
                forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Clause 9.5(a) has to be read in the light
                    of cl 9.5(b) which expressly allows OCIA to commence proceedings in any
                    other jurisdiction. Malaysia, therefore, could be one of several appropriate
                    jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the case of <em>Q&amp;M
                        Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh Kiat</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 494, despite
                    the fact that the witnesses were mostly in Malaysia, it was noted that it was
                    not the mere literal or factual geographical connections that were important,
                    but that there had to be a legal significance so that the mere number of
                    geographical connections <em>per se</em> was not conclusive
                    by any means.</p>

                    that the fact that the majority of likely witnesses resided in Singapore was
                    also not a critical factor since Malaysia and Singapore were neighbouring
                    states.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, the three key factual
                    witnesses to the substantive dispute are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chua Choon Kiang
                        (“Chua”) of the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     the defendant himself; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     Nicholas Ng (“Ng”)
                        referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These are the three individuals who
                    were present at the meeting of 23 June 2009 at which the defendant is
                    alleged to have agreed to the terms set out in the term sheet. Chua is primarily
                    based in Singapore. The defendant is a permanent resident of Singapore, having
                    business interests and a place of residence in Singapore. Ng resides in
                    Malaysia. The defendant has not suggested that Ng’s attendance cannot be
                    secured for a trial in Singapore. Neither has it been suggested by either party
                    that the attendance of any other witnesses could not be secured for a trial
                    either in Singapore or Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As the factors appear to be somewhat evenly
                    balanced, the defendant would not be able to discharge his burden to prove that
                    there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the absence of any concrete factors
                    weighing in favour of the courts of Malaysia, it is in the interests of the
                    parties and the ends of justice that the stay be refused. (It certainly has not
                    been suggested that the defendant would be prejudiced in any way should the
                    proceedings be continued in Singapore.) Given my decision to refuse a stay, it
                    would be unnecessary to discuss the second limb of the <em>Spiliada</em> test (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the reasons above, as the defendant has
                    failed to discharge his burden to show that Malaysia would be clearly or
                    distinctly the more appropriate jurisdiction for the action to be heard, the
                    appeal is dismissed. I will hear parties on costs.</p>
