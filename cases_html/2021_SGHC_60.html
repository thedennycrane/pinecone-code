</div> But the general provision in O 28 r 3(1) requires a plaintiff who intends to adduce evidence in support of <span class="font-italic">any</span> originating summons to do so by affidavit. No originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) can proceed, let alone succeed, without an affidavit in support. If nothing else, the affidavit is necessary simply to put the award itself in evidence. It is therefore a practical reality that every originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) must inevitably and will invariably be supported by an affidavit, even if there is nothing in O 69A r 2 which requires it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Second, O 69A r 2 of the Rules does not impose any requirement on a plaintiff who files an originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) as to <span class="font-italic">when</span> it must file the affidavit in support of the originating summons.

But the general provision in O 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with O 7 r 5 requires a plaintiff to serve an originating summons on the defendant within six or twelve months after the originating summons issues (depending on whether the defendant is to be served within or outside the jurisdiction).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases on the preliminary point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The defendants’ case on the preliminary point is as follows.

The plaintiff’s request under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law on 15 February 2019 was not, for the reasons given by the tribunal (see [9] above), a “request … made under Art 33(1)” within the meaning of Art 34(3). The three-month period did not therefore restart on 9 April 2019, when the tribunal disposed of the plaintiff’s further request. Although the plaintiff filed its originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) <span class="font-italic">before</span> 16 April 2019, it filed its affidavit in support <span class="font-italic">after</span> 16 April 2019. Order 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules requires the plaintiff to state “the grounds in support of the application” to set aside the award. In determining whether the plaintiff has complied with O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the contents of the plaintiff’s affidavit in support must be disregarded because it was filed out of time.

</div> The plaintiff’s originating summons simply recited the legislative provisions on which the plaintiff was relying in this application. That does not suffice to “state the grounds in support” of the application within the meaning of O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The plaintiff’s application is therefore out of time under both Art 34(3) and O 69A r 2(4) and also in breach of O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). It ought therefore to be dismissed <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The plaintiff’s case on the preliminary point is as follows.

In this case, the tribunal disposed of the plaintiff’s request under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law only on 9 April 2019.

The plaintiff’s construction of Art 34(3) would undermine both its purpose and policy. It would allow a party to manipulate the three-month period by repeatedly contriving to make defective requests under Art 33. I therefore accept the defendants’ submission that the three-month period began on 16 January 2019 – when the tribunal disposed of the plaintiff’s first and only request under Art 33 – and did not restart on 9 April 2019. It follows that the three-month period expired on 16 April 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The question of whether I can extend the three-month period does not arise.

</div>
</div>
</div> The drafters of the Model Law acknowledged this and deliberately left it to be governed by the procedural law of each Model Law jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The policy of Art 34(3) (see [24] above) is of little assistance, therefore, in resolving the critical issue on the preliminary point. That is because the Model Law has deliberately remitted the critical issue to our domestic procedural law. Having said that, I accept that the policy of Art 34(3) of the Model Law is also the policy of our procedural law as it applies to arbitration-related litigation. That is so both generally and in particular under O 69A (and O 69) of the Rules. I therefore bear this policy in mind in the analysis which follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">An originating process is fundamentally different from an affidavit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, an originating process – such as an originating summons – carries a special significance in our general procedural law. An originating process is a document of a public character. It emanates from the state, not from the parties. Its purpose is to bring the state’s considerable coercive power to bear on a defendant. Its effect is to compel the defendant to present to the court a formal answer to the plaintiff’s claim, failing which an adjudication will be entered by default in the plaintiff’s favour, as a result of which the defendants’ substantive legal rights will be permanently extinguished, at least at first instance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 An affidavit, on the other hand, is a document of a private character. It emanates from the parties and not from the state. Its sole purpose is to record in writing, upon penalty of perjury, the evidence of a witness in a convenient form for presentation to a court in civil litigation, typically when cross-examination is not available or is not warranted. An affidavit does not bring the state’s coercive power to bear on a defendant. The failure to file an affidavit does not, in and of itself, carry the risk of an adjudication on the merits by default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 An originating process is therefore fundamentally different from an affidavit and operates on a separate and higher procedural plane. Order 69A r 2(4A) of the Rules observes this fundamental difference by requiring all matters of evidence to be contained in the affidavit and not in the originating summons. It is the affidavit, therefore, which sets out the personal and documentary evidence which the plaintiff intends to rely upon in support of the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It is for this reason that our system of procedure considers civil litigation to commence when a plaintiff satisfies the procedural prerequisites necessary to cause the court, as the judicial organ of the state, to issue an originating process. As soon as that happens, the court is seised of the underlying <span class="font-italic">lis</span>. That is why a limitation period prescribed bee the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) for a particular <span class="font-italic">lis</span> stops running as soon as an originating process encompassing that <span class="font-italic">lis</span> issues. That act suffices <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> to engage the court’s jurisdiction to resolve the <span class="font-italic">lis</span> and therefore to stop the relevant limitation period. That period does not keep running until the plaintiff puts evidence before the court on which it intends to rely in support of its case on the <span class="font-italic">lis</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I am aware that the analogy between Art 34(3) of the Model Law and a statutory limitation period under the Limitation Act may be inexact. But the point I make is a conceptual one and one of universal application. As soon as an originating summons issues under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), the application commences. Further, the court gains immediate control over the plaintiff and the application. That is so whether or not that originating summons is accompanied by an affidavit. The court’s control includes the power to case manage the application under the express power in O 28 r 10(1) of the Rules and also under the general power in O 34A. This control also includes the power to strike out the application on the merits under O 18 r 19 or to dismiss the application on procedural grounds under O 28 r 10(1) or O 34A r 1(2). For this reason, I consider that the position of an originating process in relation to a statutory limitation period is, in this sense, an apposite analogy to the position of an originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) to the three-month period prescribed by Art 34(3) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Order 69A r 2 itself treats the “application” as the originating summons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, consistent with this conceptual and procedural framework, O 69A r 2 itself equates the application to set aside an award to the originating summons. It does so in two ways. First, O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) provides: “Every <span class="font-italic">application</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… to set aside an award under section 24 of the Act or Art 34(2) of the Model Law … must be made by <span class="font-italic">originating summons</span>” (emphasis added). Second, O 69A r 2(4) provides: “An <span class="font-italic">application</span> under <span class="font-italic">paragraph (1)(</span>d<span class="font-italic">)</span> above shall not be made …” (emphasis added). Both of these are mandatory and foundational provisions. They both equate the “application” to the originating summons alone, without any reference to an affidavit in support. This affidavit is governed by, and only by, O 69A r 2(4A) of the Rules. This confirms to me that even the specific procedural law in O 69A r 2 which applies to arbitration-related litigation treats an affidavit in support of an originating summons under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) as something distinct from, and ancillary to, the “application” within the meaning of O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and O 69A r 2(4). This in turn reinforces my conclusion that an “application” to set aside an award is “made” under our procedural law, and therefore within the meaning of Art 34(3) of the Model Law, when the originating summons is filed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is true that <span class="font-italic">ABC</span> (at [4]) observed that the originating process “must be accompanied by an affidavit”. But that does not undermine my conclusion. In context, and contrary to what the defendants suggest,

</div> this observation simply restates the effect of the procedural rule requiring the originating process to be accompanied by an affidavit <span class="font-italic">at the time of service</span>, not at the time of filing. This observation does not mean that an “application” within the meaning of Art 34(3) of the Model Law comprises <span class="font-italic">both</span> the originating process <span class="font-italic">and</span> the affidavit in support.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The drafting convention in the Rules</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, an examination of the Rules shows that the drafting convention adopted is to make express provision whenever the intent is to oblige a party to <span class="font-italic">file</span> a summons <span class="font-italic">together with</span> an affidavit in support. So too, the drafting convention is to make express provision whenever the intent is to oblige a party to <span class="font-italic">serve</span> a summons within a particular number of days after filing. Thus, for example, O 14 r 2(2) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The summons and the supporting affidavit or affidavits must be filed at the same time, and must be served on the defendant within 3 days from the date of filing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Order 29 r 10(4) is to the same effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Both of these provisions, of course, govern an interlocutory summons praying for interlocutory relief, not an originating summons praying for final relief. But an interlocutory summons too emanates from the state and brings the state’s coercive power to bear on the respondent to the summons, albeit to present a response to a claim for interlocutory procedural relief rather than a claim for final substantive relief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I therefore consider that there is nothing express or implied in O 69A r 2 of the Rules which requires a plaintiff who invokes the state’s coercive power against a defendant under O 69 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) to file an affidavit in support <span class="font-italic">at the same time</span> as the originating summons or to serve the originating summons within a particular number of days after it is issued. Of course, the plaintiff must comply with the general procedural requirement to serve an originating summons while it remains valid for service (see [19] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of this interpretation on the policy underlying Art 34(3)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I do not consider this construction of O 69A r 2 of the Rules to be contrary to the policy of Art 34(3) (see [24] above) or of O 69A (see [30] above). The defendants accept that, even on their construction of O 69A r 2, a plaintiff seeking to set aside an award can file its originating summons and affidavit within the three-month period and then take up to six months to serve the originating summons on a defendant within Singapore or 12 months to serve the originating summons on a defendant outside Singapore. From the perspective of promoting finality in arbitration and vindicating the reasonable commercial expectations of the parties, there is no conceptual difference between the present case and one in which the plaintiff had difficulty serving the defendants (whether within or outside the jurisdiction) until either 30 April 2019 (when the plaintiff was in a position to serve the originating summons on the defendants and the affidavit in support in compliance with O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)) or 24 May 2019 (when the plaintiff actually served the originating summons and the affidavit in support on the defendants’ solicitors).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Further, any potential for abuse which the procedural latitude allowed to a plaintiff on my construction of O 69A r 2 of the Rules is addressed by the court’s wide powers of case management of an originating summons, even before service, whether under O 34A r 5 or under O 28 r 10 of the Rules. The existence of these measures to detect and prevent abuse reinforces my view that my construction is consistent with the Model Law’s deliberate decision to leave it to the procedural law of each jurisdiction to determine when an “application” is “made” within the meaning of Art 34(3).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“State the grounds in support of the application”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I have held that an “application” to set aside an award is “made” within the meaning of Art 34(3) of the Model Law – and therefore also within the meaning of O 69A r 2(4) of the Rules – when an originating summons is filed under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules. That finding alone suffices to dispose of the preliminary point in favour of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I therefore need not deal with the defendants’ argument that the plaintiff’s application is defective because the <span class="font-italic">originating summons</span> fails to state the grounds in support of the application. The defendants submit that this is a requirement of O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).

</div> O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules does not require the “application” to state the grounds in support. Instead, it requires the “affidavit in support” to do so. Therefore, O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does not and was not intended to apply to an originating summons filed under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). And the defendants do not suggest that the affidavit which the plaintiff eventually filed in support of this application fails to comply with O 69A r 2(4A) in so far as its <span class="font-italic">contents</span> are concerned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the preliminary point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In conclusion, I hold that the plaintiff “made” its “application” to set aside this award on 15 April 2019, in compliance with Art 34(3) of the Model Law and O 69A r 2(4) of the Rules. I hold that there is nothing in Art 34(3) or in O 69A r 2 – whether express or arising by implication from a purposive or policy-based construction of both provisions – which renders the plaintiff’s application out of time or which precludes the plaintiff from relying on the grounds set out in the affidavit in support of the originating summons to advance its case on this setting aside application.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I also consider that this approach accords with the Model Law’s deliberate decision to leave it to the procedural law of individual Model Law jurisdictions to determine when an “application” under Art 34(3) of the Model Law is “made”. The defendants’ construction of Art 34(3) would mean that a party could comply fully with our procedural law (as the plaintiff has done in this case) and still find its application barred by Art 33(4). The drafters of the Model Law deliberately intended there to be no such variance between the effect of the Model Law and the procedural law of a given Model Law jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having disposed of the defendants’ preliminary point, I now address the parties’ substantive arguments on the setting aside application. I begin with a summary of the relevant law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The setting aside application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As I have mentioned (at [4] above), the plaintiff applies to set aside the award on two alternative grounds under the Act. First, the plaintiff relies on s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>to argue that the tribunal breached natural justice in dismissing its claim. Second, the plaintiff relies on Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii)<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Model Law to argue that the tribunal dealt with matters beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration in dismissing its claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 24(b) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I shall deal first with the plaintiff’s case under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. That section permits the court to set aside an award if “a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced”. Accordingly, to succeed in setting aside an award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, a plaintiff must establish the following elements (<span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan) </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 443 (“<span class="font-italic">John Holland</span>”) at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) which rule of natural justice was breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) how it was breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) how the breach prejudiced the plaintiff’s rights.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first and second John Holland elements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the first <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span> element, the plaintiff submits that the tribunal breached the fair hearing rule. The fair hearing rule requires each party to be given adequate notice of the case it must meet in the arbitration and a fair opportunity to be heard on that case (see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”) at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the second <span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>element, the plaintiff advances up to six grounds as to how the tribunal breached the fair hearing rule. For present purposes, I will analyse only the two grounds which I have accepted: (i) that the tribunal adopted a chain of reasoning which had no nexus to the parties’ cases; and (ii) that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to an essential issue arising from the parties’ arguments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles of law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The principles of law which I must apply to determine the plaintiff’s application on these two grounds are not seriously contested. They can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The grounds for setting aside an award are to be construed and applied bearing in mind the policy of minimal curial intervention in arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An application to set aside an award is not a pretext for the losing party to appeal on the merits against the tribunal’s award (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [2]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A court hearing a setting-aside application will not strive to find fault with the tribunal or to find errors in the award (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65(f)]; <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A court will set aside an award only if the breach of natural justice is “demonstrably clear on the face of the record without the need to pore over thousands of pages of facts and submissions”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>at [125]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The fundamental touchstone of the fair hearing rule is naturally the concept of “fairness”. But there are two sides to fairness. It is, of course, unfair to the losing party if the tribunal did not give it a fair hearing. But it is equally unfair to the successful party if it is deprived of the fruits of its success on an arid or technical challenge mounted <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65(a)] and [65(b)];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [2] and [125]). The court will therefore read the award generously in order to remedy only meaningful breaches of natural justice which have caused actual prejudice (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) A breach of the fair hearing rule can arise from the tribunal’s failure to apply its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments. The court will give the tribunal “fair latitude” to determine what is and is not an essential issue (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [72] and [74]) and also when reading the award to determine whether the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the essential issues.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The fact that a tribunal’s decision is inexplicable is only one factor which goes towards establishing that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [89]). If a fair reading of the award shows that the tribunal did apply its mind to the essential issues “but failed to comprehend the submissions or comprehended them erroneously, and thereby came to a decision which may fall to be characterised as inexplicable”, that will be simply an error of fact or law and the award will not be set aside (<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [90]–[91]; <span class="font-italic">BLC v BLB</span> [2014] 4 SLR 79 at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) So too, the fact that an award fails to address one of the parties’ arguments expressly does not, in itself, mean that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to that argument. There may be a valid alternative explanation for the failure (<span class="font-italic">ASG v ASH</span> [2016] 5 SLR 54 at [92]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) An award will therefore not be set aside on the ground that the tribunal failed to apply its mind to an essential issue arising from the parties’ arguments unless the failure is a clear and virtually inescapable inference from the award (<span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) A breach of the fair hearing rule can also arise from the chain of reasoning which the tribunal adopts in its award. To comply with the fair hearing rule, the tribunal’s chain of reasoning must be: (i) one which the parties had reasonable notice that the tribunal could adopt; and (ii) one which has a sufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments (<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 768 (“<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro</span>”) at [149]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) A party has reasonable notice of a particular chain of reasoning (and of the issues forming the links in that chain) if: (i) it arose from the parties’ pleadings; (ii) it arose by reasonable implication from their pleadings; (iii) it is unpleaded but arose in some other way in the arbitration and was reasonably brought to the party’s actual notice; or (iv) it flows reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or is related to those arguments<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro </span>at [150], [152], [154] and [156]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) To set aside an award on the basis of a defect in the chain of reasoning, a party must establish that the tribunal conducted itself either irrationally or capriciously such that “a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award”. A tribunal’s failure to hear from the challenging party on every single link in its chain of reasoning is therefore not in itself a breach of natural justice. It is also not in itself a breach of natural justice for the tribunal’s chain of reasoning to adopt a middle path between the parties’ diametrically opposed cases, whether on the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the primary facts, on the state or effect of the law or on the application of the law to the facts. Adopting a chain of reasoning, or a particular issue as a link in that chain, will be a breach of natural justice only if it represents a dramatic departure from the parties’ cases, is wholly at odds with the established evidence or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by both parties as being trivial or irrelevant (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [65(d)] and [65(e)]; <span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> at [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In order to apply these principles to this application, it is necessary first to set out the background facts, including the principal provisions of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The background facts of the parties’ dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants agree to build a vessel for the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The parties entered into the Contract in November 2012.

Article 8 of SA2 fixed the Cancelling Date as 30 June 2015. The defendants delivered the vessel on 22 September 2015. The plaintiff is therefore <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to liquidated damages under Art 12 of SA2 for the 84 days from 30 June 2015 to 22 September 2015, totalling US$4.2m.

The first difficulty is that – despite an optimistic indication given by the first heading in Section G – the tribunal does not deal with the plaintiff’s claim in two self-contained subsections, one dealing with the delay claim and the other dealing with the IP44 claim. The second difficulty is that the tribunal’s headings in Section G do not allude to or evoke readily identifiable elements of the plaintiff’s case or of the defendants’ defences. It is therefore impossible on the face of the award to distinguish between those findings which form part of the tribunal’s chain of reasoning on the delay claim and those which form part of its chain of reasoning on the IP44 claim. And it is exceedingly difficult to map those findings to the essential issues arising from the parties’ cases on both claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 All that can be done is to extract the tribunal’s findings from the first eight subsections of Section G running from [199] to [261] of the award (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> excluding the ninth subsection, which deals only with the counterclaim) and then attempt with generosity to arrange those findings into a coherent chain of reasoning leading from the parties’ cases on each claim to the tribunal’s decision to dismiss that claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tribunal’s findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As far as I can tell, the tribunal rested its decision to dismiss both the plaintiff’s delay and IP44 claims on the following eleven findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 At [208]–[209] of the award, under the heading “Was the [Vessel] ready for Delivery to [the End-Buyer] on the Dates of the Inspection?”, the tribunal found that the vessel was not ready for delivery on the dates on which ModuSpec inspected the vessel in July 2015 (see [82] above).

The law does not go so far as to allow a self-serving, boilerplate paragraph such as this to conclude the assessment in the tribunal’s favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I therefore give this paragraph no weight in my analysis of the plaintiff’s challenge.

The tribunal wholly failed to identify this essential evidential issue too, let alone to apply its mind to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The defendants do not point to any other paragraphs in the award as evidence that the tribunal identified the plaintiff’s causation point or applied its mind to it. Indeed, when dealing with the defendants’ counterclaim later in the award, the tribunal expressly rejected the application of the prevention principle. The defendants’ counterclaim advanced all of its defences to the delay claim, including the prevention principle, by way of counterclaim. It was also part of the defendants’ counterclaim, therefore, that the plaintiff’s acts of prevention had set at large the time for the defendants to deliver the vessel.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The tribunal’s chain of reasoning has no nexus to the defendants’ first defence. I say that for two reasons. First, the majority expressly found at [223] of the award (see [115] above), when discussing the End-Buyer’s tender process, that the End-Buyer required the generators to be rated IP44. Second, the majority expressly found at [246] of the award that, because of the meetings with the End-Buyer in January 2015, “the Parties understood that the [vessel]’s generators had to be upgraded from IP 23 to IP 44”. These findings, taken together, amount to a finding that the defendants understood that they were under an obligation to upgrade (hence “… had to be upgraded …”) the generators from IP23 to IP44 to meet the End-Buyer’s requirements. This can only mean that the tribunal rejected the first defence. That in turn excludes any nexus between the tribunal’s chain of reasoning in dismissing the IP44 claim and the first defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The defendants argue that the majority accepted the first defence at [234] of the award (see [117] above). In this paragraph, the majority found that “there was <span class="font-italic">no breach</span> by the [defendants] in supplying generators rated IP23, as the [plaintiff] … confirmed that IP 23 was fit for purpose” [emphasis added]. The defendants’ case is that the tribunal’s use of the phrase “no breach” establishes a nexus to the defendants’ first defence.

</div>
</div>
</div> That is because only the first defence turns on whether there is a breach of contract. The second defence is the defence of <span class="font-italic">estoppel</span>. Estoppel is a plea of confession and avoidance which assumes a breach but argues that the estoppel precludes the plaintiff from relying on the breach to secure a remedy. A finding of “no breach” cannot logically have a nexus to the defendants’ second defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I do not accept the defendants’ submission. I cannot give the phrase “no breach” in [234] a literal interpretation. Doing so would mean that the majority found <span class="font-italic">both</span> that the defendants understood that the vessel’s generators “had to be upgraded” from IP23 to IP44 to meet the End-Buyer’s requirements (at [223] and [246]) <span class="font-italic">and</span> that there was “no breach” by the defendants in delivering the vessel with generators rated only IP23 (at [234]). I must assume in the majority’s favour that they intended to deliver an award which was coherent and internally consistent. The only way to achieve that is to construe the words “no breach” at [234] liberally as meaning “no liability to the plaintiff” rather than literally as meaning “no breach of contract by the defendants”. This means that [234] of the award can have a nexus only to the second defence. A nexus to the first defence renders the award internally inconsistent and incoherent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 There are two other paragraphs in the award which I find have a nexus to the defendants’ second defence. First, at [223], the majority observed that the plaintiff’s “own witness evidence [stated] that IP23 rating was fit for purpose”. This is an observation not a finding. It is capable of having a nexus to the defendants’ first and second defences. But for the same reasons I have given in relation to [234], construing [223] as having a nexus to the first defence renders the award internally inconsistent and incoherent. To avoid that outcome, I must again construe [223] as having a nexus to the defendants’ second defence rather than to the first defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Second, at [245], the majority claimed to reiterate a finding (albeit one not found elsewhere in the award following the correction, see [175]–[184] below) that the plaintiff “was content with” generators rated IP23. Once again, to render the award internally consistent and coherent, I must construe this paragraph such that it has a nexus to the defendants’ second defence rather than to their first defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I therefore analyse these two paragraphs ([223] and [245]) when I come to the second defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second defence: estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The second defence is that the plaintiff is precluded by an estoppel from insisting that the defendants comply with any obligation to deliver the vessel with generators rated IP44 instead of IP23. The defendants’ case on estoppel shifted somewhat over the course of the arbitration, both as to the species of estoppel relied upon as well as the substance of the estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The statement of defence does not plead a specific species of estoppel. It simply pleads that the plaintiff asked the defendants not to raise the issue of the generators’ IP rating during the meeting with the End-Buyer in January 2015 and that the plaintiff is therefore estopped (it is not explained how) from complaining about the IP rating of the generators.

</div> I have difficulty in accepting that that was what this correction amounted to. It is clear to me that the finding that Mr Tan’s supporting documents were attributable to the plaintiff was not a clerical error but reflected accurately what the tribunal intended to find, albeit on an erroneous factual basis. Certainly, the tribunal’s decision to delete the last two sentences of [220] cannot on any view be the correction of a mere “clerical error”.

</div> For what it is worth, I consider the tribunal to have correctly rejected the plaintiff’s requests to correct these paragraphs. The alleged errors identified by the plaintiff in these paragraphs were not, on any view, mere computational, typographical or clerical errors within the meaning of Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law. But I also consider that the tribunal ought to have rejected, on the same grounds, the plaintiff’s request to correct [220].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The effect of the correction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Be that as it may, the tribunal’s correction to [220] meant that that paragraph now identifies Mr Tan correctly as the defendants’ representative. But the tribunal also “corrected” [220] by deleting the last two sentences of that paragraph. The purpose of those sentences was to establish that the majority was relying on Mr Tan’s supporting documents as amounting to a clear and contemporaneous admission by the plaintiff that generators rated IP23 were fit for purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 It is important that the majority cited no evidential basis for its primary finding against the plaintiff at [220] of the award other than the misattribution of Mr Tan’s supporting documents to the plaintiff. So too, the majority cited no evidential basis in its award for its secondary findings that evidence emanating from or attributable to the plaintiff rendered academic all of the issues listed at [174] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 A reasonable reading of the award as it stood <span class="font-italic">before</span> correction, and affording the majority the generosity to which it is entitled, leads directly to the conclusion that: (i) the majority’s basis for the finding in the last two sentences of [220] of the award was – and was only – Mr Tan’s supporting documents which the majority erroneously attributed to the plaintiff; and (b) the majority’s basis for sweeping away all of the issues listed at [174] above was – and was only – the majority’s finding at [220] that Mr Tan’s supporting documents amounted to a clear and contemporaneous admission attributable to the plaintiff, requiring no further analysis of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The tribunal’s correction to [220] of the award therefore poses a fundamental problem. If the tribunal had left [220] as it was, the plaintiff’s setting aside application in relation to the IP44 claim would necessarily have failed. I would have had to give the award a generous reading and would have read the majority’s finding at [220] as amounting to a finding that the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> had indeed made a representation to the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> through the supporting documents that generators rated IP23 were fit for its purpose. That would have sufficed to establish a nexus between the majority’s chain of reasoning on the IP44 claim and the defendants’ promissory estoppel defence. Further, the last two sentences of [220] would have established a nexus between the plaintiff’s (misattributed) representation in the uncorrected [220] and the majority’s chain of reasoning in arriving at the findings in the paragraphs which follow [220] of the award, and which I have listed at [174] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Rejecting the plaintiff’s request to correct [220] would, of course, have left an egregious and fundamental error of fact patent on the face of the award. The effect of that error of fact would have been traceable through the majority’s chain of reasoning to its ultimate decision to dismiss the IP44 claim. But, as the defendants correctly submit, a tribunal’s error – no matter how fundamental, egregious or patent, and whether of fact or law – is no basis whatsoever on which to set aside an award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 But the award as presented to me contains [220] <span class="font-italic">subject to</span> the tribunal’s corrections. The effect of the corrections is that [220] no longer has any nexus to the defendants’ estoppel defence. There is nothing either in [220] or indeed anywhere else in the award which I can read, generously or otherwise, as a finding that the plaintiff made any representation of any sort to the defendants. There is also nothing which can be read even generously as a finding that the plaintiff represented to the defendants that generators rated IP23 were fit for any purpose at all, whether that is the plaintiff’s purpose, the End-Buyer’s purpose or the ABS’s purpose. Further, deleting the last two sentences of [220] deleted with it any nexus between [220] and the majority’s references to evidence attributed to the plaintiff in the paragraphs which followed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “… the [plaintiff] has already stated in its own contemporaneous documents that IP23 was fit for its purpose …” (at [221], see [114] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “… in the light of the [plaintiff’s] own witness evidence stating that IP23 rating was fit for purpose …” (at [223], see [115] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) “ …the [plaintiff] itself had also confirmed that IP23 was fit for purpose …” (at [234], see [117] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) “… the [plaintiff] had confirmed that IP23 grade was fit for its purpose.” (at [246], see [120] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In the addendum, the tribunal does not explain what evidence, if not Mr Tan’s supporting documents, it relied upon for its findings on the IP44 claim, and in particular for sweeping away as academic and unnecessary for decision the remainder of the parties’ cases at [221], [234] and [246].

The IP44 claim as the plaintiff framed it in the arbitration had nothing to do with fitness for <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff’s</span> purpose.

The majority’s finding that the vessel passed the Acceptance Test in December 2014 has no nexus to the cases which the parties advanced in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the majority could not have rejected the IP44 claim on the basis that the vessel successfully passed the Acceptance Tests within the meaning of the Contract. In the alternative, if the majority <span class="font-italic">did </span>in fact reject the IP44 claim on the basis of this finding, that would amount to a breach of the fair hearing<span class="font-italic"> </span>rule, as this finding has no nexus to the plaintiff’s claim or to any defence which the defendants raised to that case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 I therefore find that the majority did not rely on a chain of reasoning with a nexus to the defendants’ defences on the IP44 claim in arriving at its decision to dismiss that claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The third </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">John Holland</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> element: </span><span class="font-weight-bold">connection to the award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 I have thus far found that the tribunal breached the fair hearing rule in dismissing both the delay claim and the IP44 claim. That does not suffice for the plaintiff to have the award set aside. The plaintiff must go on to establish the third and fourth <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span> elements (see [49] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The third <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span> element requires the plaintiff to show that the tribunal’s breach of the fair hearing rule “occurred in connection with the making of the award” within the meaning of s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. This requires the plaintiff to establish a causal connection between the breach of natural justice and the aspect of the award that the plaintiff is seeking to set aside. The defendants do not address this element separately in their written submissions.

</div> Those submissions go straight from submitting that there was no breach of natural justice at all to submitting that even if there was a breach of natural justice, it did not cause any prejudice to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 There are only two possibilities as to the chain of reasoning by which the tribunal arrived at its decision to dismiss the delay claim and the IP44 claim: either that chain of reasoning adopted one of the defendants’ defences in the arbitration or it did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The first possibility posits that the tribunal dismissed the delay claim for some reason <span class="font-italic">other than</span> the prevention principle and dismissed the IP44 claim for some reason <span class="font-italic">other than</span> the estoppel defence. If so, the connection between the breach of the fair hearing rule and the tribunal’s dismissal of both claims is manifest. The breach of natural justice would leave the tribunal’s chain of reasoning in dismissing each claim with no connection whatsoever to the defences which the defendants raised in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The second possibility posits that the tribunal dismissed the delay claim because it adopted the defendants’ prevention principle defence in its chain of reasoning and dismissed the IP44 claim because it adopted the defendants’ estoppel defence in its chain of reasoning. Yet, in relying on each defence, the tribunal failed to apply its mind at all to an essential issue arising from the parties’ arguments: the causation issue on the prevention principle and the existence of a representation on the estoppel defence. The tribunal’s breach of natural justice on each claim is causally connected to the making of the award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The fourth </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">John Holland</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> element: p</span><span class="font-weight-bold">rejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 The fourth <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span> element requires the plaintiff to establish that the breach caused the plaintiff to suffer prejudice (<span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>at [18]). In order to satisfy this element, the plaintiff must show “actual or real prejudice” going beyond simply the fact that it was denied natural justice (see <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [86] and [91]). A breach of natural justice causes a party to suffer actual or real prejudice if complying with the rules of natural justice <span class="font-italic">could</span> <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span><span class="font-italic"> have</span> (not <span class="font-italic">would</span> have) made a difference to the outcome of the arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 1 SLR 125 at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The fourth <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span> element is easily established in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 On both claims, if the tribunal had applied its mind to parties’ cases and the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments on those cases, it certainly <span class="font-italic">could</span> have found in favour of the plaintiff on both the delay claim and the IP44 claim. The tribunal’s breach of natural justice on both claims thus caused real prejudice to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s case under Art 34(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)(iii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 It is not necessary to analyse separately the plaintiff’s case under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law. I say that for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 First, I have held that the plaintiff’s application succeeds under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. It is therefore unnecessary to consider whether it also succeeds under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law. On the plaintiff’s case, these are alternative arguments leading to precisely the same result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Second, the plaintiff’s attack on the award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law relies on the very same facts and raises the very same core concern as its attack on the award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. That core concern is whether the chain of reasoning by which the tribunal arrived at its decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s claims had any nexus to the defendants’ defences and whether the tribunal applied its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments. I consider that Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) is not apt to address this core concern. The core concern addressed by Art 34(2) is that the award should deal with all of the disputes and matters which the parties submit to arbitration and with no others. Despite the deficiencies in the award which I have identified, I consider that it does in fact deal with all of the disputes and matters which the parties submitted to arbitration and with no others.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 The defendants submit that, even if I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established grounds for setting the award aside, I should suspend this setting aside application and remit the award to the tribunal pursuant to Art 34(4) of the Model Law in order to give the tribunal an opportunity to eliminate the grounds for setting aside.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The power to remit an award is a discretionary power. It is an alternative to setting aside an award. This has two consequences. First, the power to remit cannot be exercised unless a plaintiff has succeeded in establishing grounds for setting aside an award. Second, the power to remit cannot be exercised after an award has in fact been set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 In addition to being a discretionary power, the power to remit an award is also a limited power. The principle of limited curial intervention militates against its exercise rather than in favour of it (see <span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span> [2016] 1 SLR 966 at [25]–[34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 In considering whether to exercise the power to remit, the court must bear in mind: (i) the policy in favour of upholding finality in arbitration; and (ii) the policy in favour of vindicating the reasonable commercial expectations of parties to an arbitration. One of those expectations is that the successful party in an arbitration will not be denied the fruits of its success by reason of a curable defect in the award. But the opposing expectation is that an award which suffers from a fundamental procedural defect will be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I decline to remit the award. I have arrived at this conclusion for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 First, the tribunal’s breaches of natural justice are fundamental and woven deeply into the analytical exercise which the tribunal undertook and reasoned in Section G of the award. This is not a case in which the tribunal breached natural justice in the procedural conduct of the arbitration, for example by declining to receive evidence. If that were the case, the grounds for setting aside would be susceptible to elimination simply by allowing the tribunal to receive the further evidence and consider its effect on its decision. This is a case in which the tribunal breached the fair hearing rule by adopting a defective chain of reasoning and by failing to apply its mind to essential issues arising from the parties’ arguments. It failed to do so because it fundamentally misapprehended the parties’ arguments on the defences. It is difficult to see how a ground for setting an award of this nature aside can be eliminated. Eliminating it would require the tribunal to undertake <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> its entire analytical task. To my mind, that goes beyond the purpose of remission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Second, the purpose of remission, most importantly, is to afford the party who has established a ground for setting aside a genuine opportunity, after the tribunal has eliminated the grounds for setting aside, to persuade the tribunal to arrive at a different result. The purpose of remission is not to give the tribunal a further opportunity to formulate <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> rationalisations for its original decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In the addendum, the tribunal corrected the manifest factual error at [220] of the award. But it then sought to deny the obvious effect which that error had had on the majority’s chain of reasoning in the paragraphs which followed. I accept the plaintiff’s submission that this does not inspire confidence that remitting the award will result in the plaintiff having a genuine opportunity to persuade the tribunal to arrive at a different result.

</div> That militates against remission even in a case, such as this, where there is no allegation of apparent bias, let alone a finding of actual bias (see <span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v Raytheon Systems Ltd</span> [2015] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 495 at [10]; <span class="font-italic">Lovell Partnerships </span><span class="font-italic">(Northern) Ltd v AW Construction plc</span> (1997) 81 BLR 83 at p 99). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 For these reasons, I do not consider that the tribunal’s breach of natural justice in this case is a ground for setting aside which can be eliminated upon remission. I therefore decline to remit the award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In conclusion, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the tribunal reached its decision to dismiss the plaintiff’s delay claims and IP44 claim in breach of the fair hearing rule. An analysis of the award and the chain of reasoning in it reveals that this is not a case in which the tribunal posed the correct questions to itself but, through error of fact or law, arrived at the wrong answers to those questions. This is a case in which the tribunal failed entirely to appreciate the correct questions it had to pose to itself, let alone apply its mind to determining those questions. It therefore rendered its award in breach of the fair hearing rule and in breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 I have therefore set aside the entirety of the award (as corrected by the addendum) in so far as it dismisses the plaintiff’s claims in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 The award continues to stand in so far as it dismisses the defendants’ counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leonard Chia, Priyanka Shinde Sayaji and Eli Peh (Asia Ascent Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kenny Yap, Erik Widjaja and Eugene Lee (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
