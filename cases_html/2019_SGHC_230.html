Once a rotary valve tripped, the supervisor had to go to a breaker control panel, which was away from the main control panel, to re-set the breaker, before going back to the main monitor panel to re-set the alarm. Lastly, the supervisor would have to go to the on/off switch to restart the rotary valve.

Even if the i-report fails to mention that the plaintiff had gone to the wrong rotary valve, the plaintiff’s case that the rotary valve had suddenly “come back to life” as he was removing the steel bar from the chamber is inherently improbable or near impossible. Given the nature of the process required before a tripped rotary valve can “come back to life” – this requiring all three of the breaker, alarm, and on/off switch to be manually switched back on – I agree with the DJ that the rotary valve which the plaintiff had gone to could not have “tripped” at the material time of the accident. The only logical explanation is that the plaintiff had gone to a rotary valve which was in a state of operation at the time. I note that the plaintiff himself agreed at trial that the rotary valve could not simply re-start on its own unless a certain process was followed.

</div> According to him, this line was sufficient to show a possibility that the valve could be re-activated on its own. In my view, the word “sudden” does not imply that the valve could be re-activated on its own without human intervention. Even if I took the manual to be saying this, it does not provide evidence of how likely this is, or under what circumstances such autonomous re-activation might take place.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligence at common law, claiming that it had, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, failed to provide a safe system of work. After the trial, the district judge made a finding that there was “chaos” in the defendant’s system of work because a tower crane had broken down. In his view, this gave rise to a “volatile mix”. This arose from the fact that the metal workers had to work in close proximity with the carpenters; the two groups would be working at a height and it would therefore be extremely likely that they would get in each other’s way (at [25]). In the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim, it had been pleaded that the system of work was unsafe because the defendant had (at [26]), “(a) given deadlines to its workers which put them under pressure; (b) failed to provide sufficient formwork and/or make formwork easily accessible; and (c) failed to train its workers to follow proper procedures and not take formwork away from another worker”. On appeal, Prakash J (as she then was) noted that the finding of the judge that there had been a “volatile mix” was not raised in the pleadings or affidavit. The allegations in relation to the “volatile mix” were raised only in cross-examination and it was held that they ought to have been rejected by the district judge. Given that a court is not allowed to give a decision on material facts which have not been pleaded, Prakash J rejected the district judge’s finding that there had been a “volatile mix” (at [26] and [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Like <span class="font-italic">China Construction</span>, I find that the DJ here similarly made a decision on a fact which had not been pleaded<span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the DJ’s view, the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism in the rotary valves was adequately pleaded at paragraph 9(a) and 9(b) of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim.

Both paragraphs are too general, and mention nothing of the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism in any of the rotary valves. It is not possible for the defendant to be aware of this aspect of the plaintiff’s case on the basis of such general pleadings. The plaintiff’s entire case at trial had nothing to do with the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. Although the plaintiff’s counsel asked questions relating to the various safety features that were allegedly absent in the rotary valve system, he failed to specifically query about the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. In any event, the plaintiff cannot escape the consequences of inadequate pleading by pointing to the fact that he had raised the unpleaded facts during cross-examination. I also observe that the failure to install the automatic tripping mechanism was not mentioned in the plaintiff’s affidavit. Given the circumstances, I cannot hold that the pleadings at paragraphs 9(a) and 9(b) are adequate to support the plaintiff’s belated allegation. Paragraphs 9(f), 9(i) and 9(j) do not speak of this aspect of the plaintiff’s case, which is that the defendant failed to install an automatic tripping mechanism if someone was to open the rotary valve. They instead refer to the defendant’s failure to ensure that the valve would not suddenly rotate or suddenly re-activate. As for paragraph 9(n), this was again too general and mentions nothing of the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. As I have stated above, the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues with sufficient particularity so that the opponent can take steps to deal with the case and is not caught by surprise. In this case, the phrase “failing to establish a safe system of work” is capable of encompassing a very broad range of matters and does not permit the defendant to know in advance the case which it has to meet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I note that there had been no application to court for an amendment of the pleadings. Having determined that the existing pleadings are inadequate, and given that a judgment cannot be allowed to stand on an unpleaded point (see <span class="font-italic">China Construction </span>at [26]), I allow the defendant’s appeal. Accordingly, I also dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal against the DJ’s finding of contributory negligence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was sufficient evidence of the defendant’s negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Even if I am wrong on the pleadings point, there is insufficient evidence to prove negligence on the defendant’s part in failing to install an automatic tripping mechanism for the rotary valve machines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is trite law that in order to succeed in a claim under the tort of negligence, a claimant has to establish that (a) the defendant owes the claimant a duty of care; (b) the defendant has breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it; (c) the defendant’s breach has caused the claimant damage; (d) the claimant’s losses arising from the defendant’s breach are not too remote; and (e) such losses can be adequately proved and quantified: <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 at [21]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In my view, the plaintiff has not proved that the defendant has breached the duty of care owed by acting below the standard of care required of it. The standard of care is the general objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill: <span class="font-italic">Miah </span><span class="font-italic">Rasel v 5 Ways Engineering Services Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 3 SLR 480 at [30]. A number of variables go towards determining the appropriate standard of care: the likelihood and risks of harm, the extent of harm, the costs of avoiding the harm, the defendant’s conduct of activity, the hazard or danger posed to the plaintiff and the industry standards or common practice (see <span class="font-italic">BNM (</span><span class="font-italic">administratrix of the estate of B, deceased) on her own behalf and on behalf of others v National University of Singapore and another </span>[2014] 2 SLR 258 at [63] citing Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2011) at paras 5.013–5.035). In this case, there was no evidence adduced by the plaintiff to show that the industry practice required the defendant to install rotary valves with an automatic tripping mechanism. I also observe that the rotary valve machines were being sold commercially without an automatic tripping mechanism, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>. there was no indication by the plaintiff that there was an automatic tripping mechanism commercially available in the market, and that the defendant was careless in failing to procure it. Under the circumstances, I find that the defendant had not breached its duty of care owed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has therefore failed to prove one of the essential elements in a claim for negligence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the DJ was entitled to take judicial notice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The law on judicial notice was extensively canvassed in <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan v </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Beng Construction (1998) Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 587 at [19] to [33] (“<span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan</span>”). I summarise the important principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Section 59 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”) provides an exception to the general rule that all facts in issue and all relevant facts must be proved by evidence. This provision allows the court to take judicial notice of certain categories of facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It has been held that the draftsman’s clear intention was not to provide in s 59 of the EA an exhaustive list of facts of which judicial notice may be taken, and that it is therefore permissible to apply the common law doctrine of judicial notice to determine which matters outside the confines of ss 59(1) and 59(2) are judicially noticeable (see <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At common law, there are two broad categories of facts of which judicial notice may be taken. The first are facts which are so notorious or so clearly established that they are beyond the subject of reasonable dispute. The second category comprises specific facts which are capable of being immediately and accurately shown to exist by authoritative sources (see <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan </span>at [25] and [27]). A fact is considered notorious or clearly established if (Sudipto Sarkar &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence </span>(Wadhwa &amp; Co, 16th Ed, 2007) at p 1133, cited in <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan </span>at [27]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…its existence or operation is accepted by the public without qualification or contention. The test is whether sufficient notoriety attaches to the fact involved as to make it proper to assume its existence without proof. The fact that a belief is not universal, however, is not controlling, for there is scarcely any belief that is accepted by everyone. Those matters familiarly known to the majority of mankind or those persons familiar with the particular matter in question are properly within the concept of judicial notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 At [30] of the GD, the DJ stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I was of the view that either (a) a chamber cover which could be opened while the furnace was operating, without triggering a trip, or (b) a furnace was one whose cover could open while it was operating, <span class="font-italic">simply failed to take account of staff safety</span>. It was an obvious omission. On either account, the furnace was unsafe and the defendant was negligent. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Although the DJ did not use the term “judicial notice”, the defendant characterised the finding of fact above as being based on judicial notice.

It is apparent from the GD that the DJ did not arrive at the finding that the furnace was “unsafe” based on any evidence which was adduced. Indeed, there was no evidence available before the court that the furnace was unsafe because of the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Based on [30] of the GD, it appears that what the DJ took judicial notice of was the “fact” that the furnace was <span class="font-italic">unsafe</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on account of the defendant’s failure to install an automatic tripping mechanism. This “fact” does not fall within any of the enumerated categories of facts under s 59 of the EA. Despite the DJ’s suggestion at [30] of the GD that the lack of an automatic tripping mechanism and the fact that the furnace did not stay locked even when it was in operation was “an obvious source of danger”, the safety of the furnace is clearly not a fact which is so notorious or so clearly established that it is beyond the subject of reasonable dispute. The safety, or the lack thereof, is a fact-sensitive assessment to be made on a holistic consideration of all the evidence adduced. It is clear that such specific “facts” are not intended to fall within the first category at common law. In this case, the plaintiff also failed to point to any authoritative source which would enable me to take judicial notice of the fact that the defendant’s failure to install the automatic tripping mechanism was unsafe. Thus, this fact cannot fall within the second category of judicially noticeable facts set out in <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan</span> as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant’s counterclaim in unjust enrichment was adequately pleaded </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The DJ below, relying on <span class="font-italic">Alam</span><span class="font-italic"> Jahangir v Mega Metal Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGHC 198 at [11]–[13], ordered the plaintiff to pay 50% of the medical expenses and medical leave wages.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this has not been adequately pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As I have stated above at [25], a party is required by O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court to set out in his pleadings all material facts on which he relies for his claim. In an unjust enrichment claim, this includes pleading the specific unjust factor upon which the defendant relies. In <span class="font-italic">Red Star Marine Consultants Pte Ltd v Personal Represen</span><span class="font-italic">tatives of the Estate of Satwant Kaur d/o Sardara Singh, deceased and another </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Red Star</span>”) [2019] SGHC 144, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claims in unjust enrichment as they were not adequately pleaded, stating at [50]–[51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51. The plaintiff’s claim simply asserted that the defendants were liable to it in unjust enrichment without identifying a particular recognised unjust factor or event which would give rise to a claim. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [134] [(“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”)]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘It is important to reiterate that there is no freestanding claim in unjust enrichment on the abstract basis that it is “unjust” for the defendant to retain the benefit – <span class="font-italic">there must be a particular recognised unjust factor or event which gives rise a claim</span>.

However, this ground of restitution has not “yet [taken] root within the common law of restitution and unjust enrichment, and has generally appeared not, as yet, to have found favour amongst scholars in this particular field of law” (see <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [129]), and has also been described as a topic of controversy (see also <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 363 at [140]). As the defendant failed to specify a recognised ground of restitution in its pleadings, and because “absence of basis” is a doctrine which is not yet recognised under Singapore law, I allow the plaintiff’s appeal against the defendant’s counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is with a heavy heart that I have ruled against the plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I would like to make the following concluding remarks which are of general application.  The Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WICA”) establishes a statutory compensation scheme available to employees who suffer injuries in the course of employment. The statutory scheme has its advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis a common law claim in negligence, some of which are not always thoroughly considered. It is meant to provide a quick basic no-fault compensation for (a) employees injured by accidents during or arising in employment, where the compensation is for the employee (and his estate if relevant); and (b) dependants for loss of dependency: <span class="font-italic">China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another v Low Yi </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Cindy and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 523 (“<span class="font-italic">China </span><span class="font-italic">Taiping</span>”) at [19]. It is generally also a lower cost alternative to pursuing a common law claim for damages arising from workplace negligence: <span class="font-italic">SGB </span><span class="font-italic">Starkstrom Pte Ltd v Commissioner for Labour </span>[2016] 3 SLR 598 at [1]. However, in order to successfully claim under WICA, an injured worker must make a claim for compensation within one year from the date of the accident, or in the case of death, within one year from the date of the death: s 11(1)(b) of WICA. There are also other statutory rules which the injured worker must comply with to make out a successful WICA claim. The procedure for a WICA claim has been explained in greater detail in <span class="font-italic">China Taiping </span>at [25] – [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The duty of counsel is to advise an injured worker on the appropriate course of action to take by carefully weighing the relative pros and cons of a WICA claim vis-à-vis a common law claim. This should be done having regard to the strength of the available evidence, which either supports or denies the claim. While an injured worker may well believe that he stands to gain a larger sum if he were to successfully claim at common law (given that there are fixed limits to the sums of compensation awarded to a worker under a WICA claim), the job of his counsel is to closely scrutinise the evidence and assess whether all the elements of a claim in negligence can be satisfied. This includes understanding the workings of the machinery, if any, to determine if the worker’s version of events is plausible in so far as the operation of the machinery is concerned. It is only if counsel forms the view that the worker has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that he should advise the worker to proceed with a common law claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The injured worker, if he is considering a common law claim, should consult his solicitor as soon as possible whilst the events are still fresh in his mind and provide him with a faithful account of the events leading up to the accident. The worker should not view the common law claim as a “game of chance” to gain more in the event of a successful claim. He will end up with nothing, despite having suffered from an injury, if his claim cannot be established. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I award costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, fixed at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Dedar Singh Gill  <br/>Judicial Commissioner </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ramasamy s/o Karuppan Chettiar (Central Chambers Law Corporation) for the appellant in DCA 6/2019 and the respondent in DCA 7/2019;<br/>Shanker Kumar K (Hoh Law Corporation) for the respondent in DCA 6/2019 and the appellant in DCA 7/2019.<br/><br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
