</div>
</div> Clause 43 of the Subcontract constituted a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The Arbitration Agreement was not null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. To be clear, there is no express exception in s 6 of the AA (unlike s 6 of the IAA) where a stay may be refused if the arbitration agreement is found to be null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. Nonetheless, in my view, a court considering a stay application under s 6 of the AA can and should also consider if the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed as part of its consideration of whether (a) there is an “arbitration agreement” within the meaning of s 6 of the AA; and/or (b) there is “sufficient reason” for the court to refuse a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Fourth, it followed that only the second limb from the <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings</span> test remained to be determined in this case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the dispute in OC 28 (or any part thereof) fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. It was undisputed that the burden fell on the defendant to prove this positively, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard of review: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>at [63]–[70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Finally, the remaining conditions in s 6(2) of the AA were also met. In other words: (a) the claimant did not contend that there was any other reason why the dispute ought not to be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement; and (b) the defendant had, at all times, remained ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration. While there was some suggestion before the AR below that condition (b) was in dispute, those arguments were not pursued before me by claimant’s counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The upshot of the foregoing was that there was only one issue to be determined in this appeal: whether the dispute in OC 28 (or any part thereof) fell within the ambit of the Arbitration Agreement.

Clause 43.3 essentially provided that, save for some exceptions, arbitration could not be commenced until the Subcontract works had been completed. The AR found this to be a neutral factor, on the basis of a letter where the defendant indicated its position that any disputes must be referred to arbitration.

Since that was the case, it followed that the determination of OC 28 would entail examining the Subcontract and determining whether the disputed works were indeed original works. In my judgment, that was plainly an issue arising “in connection [with]” the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 But that was not all. Even the claimant’s case was clearly connected with, and <span class="font-italic">arose </span><span class="font-italic">out of</span>, the Subcontract. The claimant had on several occasions taken the position that the disputed works<span class="font-italic"> </span>should be regarded as variation works, even if the defendant did not in fact certify them as such. In other words, its real bone of contention was not that the defendant was wrong in refusing to pay for works falling outside the Subcontract, but that the defendant was wrong in refusing to acknowledge them as variation works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the first place, the claimant appeared to have performed the disputed works on the impression that the defendant had given instructions that amounted to variation orders (or at least with the belief that they would or should amount to variations). That explained why the claimant proceeded to submit variation claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Second, its solicitors’ letter dated 6 December 2021 expressly acknowledged that there was “a dispute or difference between [the parties] as to whether the work required to work around [the existing piles] constitutes a variation order or are [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] part of the Sub-Contract Works [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the original works]”.

</div> Clearly, the claimant took the former view (that they were a variation). At this juncture, it was also worth noting that the letter went on to propose that the issue be submitted to court “notwithstanding Clause 43 of the Sub-Contract”. This was, in my view, a stark concession from the claimant that clause 43, the Arbitration Agreement, <span class="font-italic">was</span> applicable to the parties’ dispute.

That was why the claimant sought their certification as such. Its complaint was that the defendant then refused to acknowledge or certify the works as variations, when they should be regarded as variations. These pleaded facts were incompatible with the claimant’s modified position in the stay proceedings, that the disputed works fell outside the Subcontract altogether and were not variation works at all. This shift struck me as being an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 This contradiction went beyond the pleaded facts to the way the claimant pleaded its cause of action. Paragraph 14 of the SOC attributed the claimant’s losses to the defendant’s “breaches of the [Subcontract]”. In other words, because of the defendant’s failure to certify the disputed works as variation works, and to perform its obligation to pay for those works (as variation works), the claimant should be compensated for the losses flowing from those <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> breaches. With the claim so framed, it was hard to see how the dispute in OC 28 could be characterised as anything but one arising out of and connected with the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Granted, the SOC also prayed for declarations that the disputed works were “not within the scope of works to be carried out by the [claimant] under the Sub-contract”. However, in my view, such a prayer remained consistent with a case that the disputed works should have constituted variation works <span class="font-italic">under the Subcontract</span>. Moreover, the relief sought must be construed against the overall thrust of the SOC. As reflected in [43], the claimant’s entire claim in OC 28 rested on the Subcontract and/or the Quotation. Its SOC did not even allude to an alternative cause of action or basis for recovery. It did not, for example, seek relief on the basis of <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>; nor did it contend that the disputed works were undertaken as part of a separate or collateral contract completely unrelated to the Subcontract. Neither was its case that the disputed works<span class="font-italic"> </span>could not have amounted to a valid variation, for instance on the basis that they exceeded the scope of permissible variations under the variations clause in the Subcontract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, clause 21).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On this view of the claimant’s case, the dispute in OC 28 would naturally and almost inevitably bring into play a host of Subcontract provisions concerning matters such as instructions (clause 20), variations (clause 21), and possibly the valuation of variations (clause 22).

It covered “any dispute or difference … with regards to any matter or thing of whatsoever nature arising out of the [Subcontract] or in connection therewith”. As alluded to at [38] above, there was a live dispute as to whether the disputed works fell within or without the Subcontract. Whether the claimant’s position was that they ought to be variations or fell outside the Subcontract altogether, the defendant’s position was that these were works falling within the original scope of the Subcontract. In my view, that position was sufficient by itself to situate the dispute as one connected with, if not arising out of, the Subcontract. The entire dispute in OC 28 thus <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The learned AR observed that the defendant produced no evidence that the disputed works were works falling within the Subcontract.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  AR’s oral grounds of 23 August 2022 at para 11.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my respectful view, that was not the pertinent question – the pertinent question was whether the defendant had produced enough evidence to show that the <span class="font-italic">dispute</span> was one falling within the scope of the <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Agreement</span>. This followed from how the two-stage inquiry in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>(as set out at [31] above) has been framed: (a) what <span class="font-italic">matter(s)</span> is/are in the court proceedings; and (b) whether the <span class="font-italic">matter(s)</span> fell within the scope of the <span class="font-italic">arbitration agreement</span> on its true construction. To this end, I found that sufficient evidence had been<span class="font-italic"> </span>adduced, in the form of the Arbitration Agreement, the other terms of the Subcontract, and the SOC. These provided sufficient tools in this case to (a) assess what the matters in OC 28 were; (b) define what the Arbitration Agreement’s scope was; and (c) then put the two together to arrive at a conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In fairness to the AR, it may be that evidence concerning the works performed and the Subcontract’s scope of works would form a relevant consideration in this inquiry. However, that would not be the <span class="font-italic">central</span> inquiry in deciding whether or not<span class="font-italic"> </span>to grant the stay. The defendant did not, in SUM 2805, have to prove its substantive case that the disputed works were original works – that is a question to be determined in the arbitration. Moreover, O 6 r 7(4) of the ROC provides that a defendant who raises a jurisdictional challenge to a claim is not required to file its defence on the merits. What the defendant did have to show was that there was a <span class="font-italic">dispute</span> between the parties as to whether the works fell within the Subcontract or not, and that this dispute fell within the ambit of the Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even if one were to adopt the AR’s approach and focus on the <span class="font-italic">works</span> in question instead of the<span class="font-italic"> dispute</span>, I would still have found that there was at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the disputed works fell within the Subcontract. This was not a case where the allegedly excluded works occurred, for example, at a different location, in a different time period, or under a different project, or where the works were plainly and obviously of a different nature (for instance, demolition versus façade repair). At its core, the issue was a change in the methods and materials used for the GI works. The JGP works, for example, involved a change in the method of grouting, but they were meant to achieve the very same outcomes (the introduction of grout) at the manholes. The WSM works likewise involved a change in the diameter of piles used (from 1,850mm to 800mm) to accommodate the existing, unremoved piles, but they too were performed to achieve the same outcomes for which the claimant was engaged. Further, as noted above, the claimant’s own pleaded position was that these works ought to have qualified as variation works <span class="font-italic">under the Subcontract</span> (see above at [35]–[47]). Given my primary view that this was an issue to be finally decided in the arbitration, I say no more on it. It suffices to observe that, even without scrutinising the evidence in detail, it was apparent to me from the broad contours of the case that the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> threshold would be clearly met in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claimant failed to show that the dispute fell outside the scope of the Arbitration Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Even if one were to scrutinise the claimant’s case and the specific arguments and evidence it presented as to why a stay should be refused, the same conclusion would have been reached.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Quotation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The claimant relied on its Quotation to show that it did not contract to perform angular JGP or horizontal permeation grouting works, and instead only contracted to perform vertical JGP works.

Accepting it would have required me to accept that the claimant’s use and interpretation of the Quotation had to be correct. But that inference would have required the claimant to pass through a number of additional legal and factual hoops. One would have to examine, for example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What was the legal status of the Quotation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Subcontract? For instance, was the Quotation incorporated into the Subcontract?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Assuming that the Quotation was relevant to the Subcontract (by incorporation or otherwise), what was the weight or significance to be given to the Quotation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the rest of the Subcontract? For instance, would statements in the Quotation take precedence over potentially inconsistent terms?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Construing the Quotation, was the claimant’s reliance on, and interpretation of, note 3 correct? For example, did the exclusion of angular JGP and horizontal permeation grouting “from [the] <span class="font-italic">rates</span>” [emphasis added] mean an exclusion from the <span class="font-italic">Subcontract</span>? What did the statement that the rates shall be quoted “separately” mean – for instance, did it mean a supplementary quotation would be needed, or a separate contract altogether? Further, how was note 3 meant to sit alongside note 7? It appeared that by virtue of note 7, items not mentioned in the BOQ were to be considered as variation orders: “[o]ur price is based on what have been quoted in [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]. Any item that is not mentioned in the [BOQ] <span class="font-italic">will be considered as VO</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 These were not straightforward questions. Take for example, the legal relationship between the Quotation and the Subcontract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first question above, in [58(a)]). Clause 1.1(iv) of the Subcontract defined the “Sub-Contract” to mean “th[e] Sub-Contract Agreement and the documents as specified in Clause 4”.

In light of these unanswered questions, the claimant’s reliance on and interpretation of the Quotation could not be regarded as self-evidently correct, such that it was inconceivable (even to a court hearing a stay application) that the dispute was one connected with the Subcontract. On the contrary, they simply served to fortify my view that there were several questions arising out of or in connection with the Subcontract that may arise in the determination of this claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The claimant also relied on the Quotation in relation to the WSM works.

In addition, the mere fact that quotes were based on certain assumptions did not say much about what was to happen if those assumptions were disproved. Risk could be allocated in a multitude of ways. The inquiry as to risk allocation would almost certainly necessitate a deeper examination of the Subcontract’s precise arrangements. One aspect of these arrangements was clause 3.5 of the Subcontract, which deemed the claimant to have acquainted itself with the actual site condition, and precluded the consideration of claims based on a change in site condition (save as otherwise provided for in the Subcontract):

</div> The gist of those e-mails was that shop drawings were urgently needed so that external approvals could be sought. The e-mails were largely a combination of chasers for drawings to be submitted, and technical suggestions on how the drawings ought to be modified to secure the approvals sought.

In addition, you will waive off all the cement wastages used for the manhole ground improvement works for the contract. You also offered that <span class="font-italic">upon completion</span> of the manhole ground improvement works, you would <span class="font-italic">also grant us a</span><span class="font-italic"> lump sum of $100,000.00 upon completion of the works</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 There was therefore some evidential basis to infer that the $10,566.50 and $85,810.19 were part of some proposed variation to the Subcontract, to facilitate the completion of works <span class="font-italic">under</span> the Subcontract’s original scope.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Second, and more significantly, whatever the stated and actual purposes were for the sums being extended, what mattered to this stay application was that they appeared to have been paid to the claimant <span class="font-italic">qua</span> subcontractor under the Subcontract. Additionally, the fact that the claimant proceeded to accept these payments <span class="font-italic">may</span> have a bearing on whether it should be taken to have regarded the disputed works as falling within the Subcontract (Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law</span><span class="font-italic"> and Practice of Construction Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) at para 5.168):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An issue may arise in relation to any attempt to rely on a change in scope of contract for the purpose of taking an item of work outside the contract rates of the original contract. In most cases the claimant has to elect between seeking a restitutionary remedy in <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> or a claim for damages. Understandably, an ‘innocent contractor’ may be expected to choose one of these positions in the alternative. <span class="font-italic">However, if the contractor continues to execute the disputed work over </span><span class="font-italic">a period of time and begins to accept payment in respect of the work on the terms of the original contract, the contractor may be precluded from subsequently maintaining that it is executing the disputed works under protest.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In making these observations, I do not suggest that these facts and legal propositions necessarily favour either the claimant’s or the defendant’s case. That is a matter for the arbitral tribunal’s determination. Rather, they demonstrate that the <span class="font-italic">types of issues</span> that would arise for consideration in the claim were closely connected with the Subcontract, and as such, fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The SOC’s prayers for declarations</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Thus far, the case has been analysed as one for damages. But the claimant’s SOC also sought declarations that the disputed works were “not within the scope of works to be carried out by the [claimant] under the [Subcontract]”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Plainly, this presented a dispute connected with the Subcontract. To determine whether the declaration ought to be granted, the court or tribunal would need to decide: (a) what the Subcontract’s scope of works were; and (b) whether the disputed works fell within the Subcontract’s scope of works. In my view, in so far as the “matter” in OC 28 related to the declaratory relief sought, that “matter” too was connected with the Subcontract and therefore fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant was and remained ready and willing to do all things necessary to the arbitration’s proper conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Finally, I was also satisfied that the defendant was and remained ready and willing to do all that was necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration and further, that there was no sufficient reason for the court to refuse to stay this action. This remained the case even though under clause 43.3 of the Subcontract, the claimant may only commence arbitration after the works under the Subcontract have been completed, unless the parties consent in writing otherwise. That sub-clause was agreed to by the parties, and party autonomy prevails. There was no suggestion by the claimant that the provision was unjust or unfair in any way. Further, as I indicated above at [19], before me, the claimant did not dispute that the defendant was ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration. Nor was there any suggestion by the claimant, whether in its affidavit or submissions, that there existed any sufficient reason why the court should nevertheless refuse to stay the action even though the dispute <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the defendant’s appeal. In my judgment, the entire dispute in OC 28 fell within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. If nothing else, given the defendant’s position that the disputed works fell within the Subcontract’s original scope of works, the parties’ dispute <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> fell within the ambit of the Arbitration Agreement. Whether the defendant will be able to prove its case on the merits remains an open question. Likewise, whether the claimant can succeed on its claim, as pleaded, remains to be seen. But these are not questions to be answered by this court. Having agreed to refer disputes arising out of or connected with the Subcontract to arbitration, the claimant must be kept to its contractual bargain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I therefore reversed the AR’s decision dismissing SUM 2805 and, in its place, I made an order under s 6 of the AA staying OC 28 in favour of arbitration, as prayed for by the defendant in SUM 2805. In light of my decision to allow the appeal and order a stay under s 6 of the AA, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the claimant would have succeeded on its alternative application for a stay based on O 3 r 2(2) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 With regard to costs, in RA 269, the defendant also appealed against the AR’s order below that it pay costs fixed at $12,000 (all-in) to the claimant. Given my decision on the stay application, I also reversed the AR’s costs order. I fixed costs of the application below at $13,000 (all-in) to be paid by the claimant to the defendant – this increased figure took into account differences in the parties’ disbursements. Costs of the appeal were fixed in the sum of $10,000 (all-in), also to be paid by the claimant to the defendant. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Twang Kern Zern and Simone Bamapriya Chettiar (Central Chambers Law Corporation) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzalez (Selvam LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
