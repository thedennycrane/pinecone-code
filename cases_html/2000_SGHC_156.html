<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 The plaintiffs are the Management

Corporation of Strata Title No. 607, a strata title development known as Alexandra Centre

and located along Alexandra Road. This development comprises 2 land lots, namely (a) Mukim

1 Lot 2059L ("Lot 2059L") and (b) Mukim 1 Lot 2094X ("the Land"). Both

land lots are registered land under the Land Titles Act. The shops and apartment units in

Alexandra Centre are built on Lot 2059L. No building is erected on the Land, which is an

open area with most of it paved over and used for access and parking of vehicles. The Land

constitutes part of the common property of Alexandra Centre.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 Adjacent to Alexandra Centre is a row of

2-storey terrace houses. This is divided into 14 units in all, comprising 7 first-storey

and 7 second-storey units. The first-storey units are shop units whereas the second-storey

units are residential apartments. The defendants are the registered proprietors of these

14 units. Some of the defendants own more than one of the units and some units have more

than one registered proprietor. In all there are 12 proprietors and all of them are joined

as defendants in this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The deed of indenture in respect of each

of the defendants' units contains a grant of an easement to the proprietor thereof in

relation to the Land. I shall set out its terms later. The question is the scope of that

easement. The defendants and the other occupants of their units have been using the Land

for the following purposes:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) access to their units from the public

  road by foot or by vehicle;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) parking of vehicles of the

  defendants, occupants and their customers, including overnight parking; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) conducting part of their businesses,

  such as repairs to and installation of accessories on vehicles, seating for customers of a

  restaurant and storage of goods.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The plaintiffs take the position that

the defendants' use of the Land is beyond the scope of the easement. In this summons they

seek the determination of the court on the following questions:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Whether the defendants, by themselves

  and/or their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are entitled to occupy the Land

  for their usage to the exclusion of the plaintiffs. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Whether the defendants, by themselves

  and/or their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are entitled to place/store/park

  or cause to be placed/stored/parked goods, vehicles and/or other chattel on the Land.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Whether the defendants, by

  themselves and/or their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are entitled to

  enter/cross over the Land otherwise than by foot i.e. by way of motor vehicle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Whether the plaintiffs by themselves

  and/or their servant, agent or otherwise are entitled to quiet enjoyment for any purpose

  they deem fit of the Land without obstruction or interference from the defendants or their

  servant, agent or otherwise or any of them.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 After the first day of hearing the

parties decided to refer the matter to the Singapore Mediation Centre for mediation.

However this turned out to be unsuccessful and they reverted to me with further

submissions. After hearing them again on 22 May 2000, I made the following declarations

and orders:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The Defendants, by themselves

  and/or their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are not entitled to occupy, for

  their usage to the exclusion of the Plaintiff, the land known as Lot 2094X Mukim 1

  Alexandra Road or part thereof ("Lot 2094X") belonging to the Plaintiff.</font></p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The Defendants, by themselves

  and/or their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are not entitled to place and or

  store goods and other chattel on Lot 2094X.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) The Defendants, by themselves and/or

  their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are entitled to park vehicles on Lot

  2094X subject to the following conditions:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) the vehicles are not to obstruct the

  free flow of vehicles along the service road;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) parking means the leaving of the

  vehicle on Lot 2094X in a reasonable manner for the purpose of enabling the driver to

  carry on his affairs at the Defendants' premises namely:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) residence;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) business (i.e. for employment there);</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) as lawful visitors; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) as customers,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">and for this purpose, parking does not

    include leaving vehicles on Lot 2094X for the purpose of storage or conducting business in

    respect of the vehicles e.g. repairs etc.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) The Defendants, by themselves and/or

  their servant, agent or otherwise or any of them, are entitled to enter/cross over Lot

  2094X otherwise than by foot i.e. by way of motor vehicle.</font></p>
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) The Plaintiff by itself and/or its

  servant, agent or otherwise is entitled to quiet enjoyment for any purpose it deems fit of

  Lot 2094X without obstruction or interference from the Defendants or their servant, agent

  or otherwise or any of them subject to the Defendants' rights in the easement as

  abovestated.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) The Defendants to pay to the

  Plaintiff the total sum of S$ 2,400.00 as costs of this application, with each Defendant

  to contribute S$ 200.00.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) The Plaintiff to have liberty to

  apply for further orders for enforcement.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 The Plaintiffs have appealed against my

decision in respect of declaration (iii) above and I now give the grounds of my decision

in respect of it. For completeness, I include brief reasons for the other declarations,

i.e., (i), (ii), (iv) and (v).</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Adverse possession</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 The defendants were not represented by

counsel. But counsel for the plaintiffs, Miss Hong, in the best tradition of the Bar,

presented her clients' case fairly and provided me with invaluable support in relation to

the authorities that might favour the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The first consideration is whether the

defendants might have acquired any title to the Land by adverse possession. There is some

evidence that the defendants, or their predecessors-in-title, had been using the Land

since 1961 for access, parking and for their business much in the same manner as they are

using it today. Although such evidence was not given by way of formal affidavit, Miss Hong

did not dispute it. The plaintiffs came into the picture after the vendors developed

Alexandra Centre and the management corporation was constituted in 1982. Up to that time

no action was taken by the vendors against the defendants or their predecessors-in-title

in respect of their use of the Land. Even after 1982, the plaintiffs did not take any

action until shortly before this summons was filed in December 1999. In the affidavit

filed by Tan Kok Peng ("Tan") on behalf of the plaintiffs, Tan deposed that the

Land was being used by the defendants to the exclusion of the plaintiffs. Hence the

defendants had been using the Land continuously in this manner to the exclusion of the

plaintiffs for almost 40 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 There may have been other impediments to

a claim in adverse possession, but an inquiry as to that is rendered unnecessary by virtue

of the Land Titles Act. This is because the defendants had not taken out any application

under section 172(8) of that Act. Any title they might have been able to claim had been

removed by operation of section 50, which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">50. Except as provided in section 172(8)

  and (9), no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of

  registered land shall be acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation

  Act or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be extinguished

  by the operation of that Act.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Section 172(8) obliges a person to make

his claim in adverse possession by 1 September 1984. The defendants had not made any claim

at all and section 50 of the Act would now exclude such a claim.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Prescription</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 The second consideration is whether any

easement had been acquired by prescription on the basis of the doctrine of lost modern

grant. This doctrine applies in Singapore in respect of unregistered land - see <i>Xpress

Print v Monocrafts Pte Ltd &amp; Anor</i> (Unreported) Civil Appeal No. 202/1999 (24 July

2000) at paragraph 36. In the present case there is some evidence that the defendants had

been using the Land to park their vehicles since their units were completed in 1960 or

1961, i.e. almost 40 years before the plaintiffs took out this action. If the defendants

had been doing this for a period of 20 years before the Land was brought under the

provisions of the Land Titles Act, they could have acquired an easement over it. Such an

easement would not be affected by the subsequent conversion to registered land because

section 46 provides that such land is held subject to any subsisting easement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 However, from the Certificate of Title

it can be seen that a qualified Certificate of Title was issued on 6 November 1978.

Therefore the requisite 20 years would not have elapsed since the defendants' units were

only completed around 1960. Once the Land has become registered land, no easement can be

acquired by prescription by virtue of section 97 of the Land Titles Act. Accordingly,

there could not have been an easement acquired by prescription.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Indenture</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 The remaining question is the scope of

the easement granted in the indenture. The plaintiffs exhibited the deeds of indenture in

respect of all the defendants' units. They are similar in nature and I reproduce below a

typical indenture, which relates to one of the first-storey units:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THIS INDENTURE is made the 24th day of

  October One thousand nine hundred and sixty two (1962) Between ASIA TRUST &amp;

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 It can be seen from this indenture that

an undivided half share of the land in fee simple was conveyed to the purchaser of the

unit who had also taken a lease on the first-storey of the building for 9,999 years. The

other undivided half share of the land was conveyed to the purchaser who had taken a

similar lease on the second-storey of that building. The First Schedule to the indenture

describes the land in question and the interest conveyed. This comprises the land upon

which the building is built and includes the rights described in the words underlined

above.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 Miss Hong agreed that those words

relate to the grant of an easement, the dominant tenement being the land the subject of

the indenture, i.e. the land on which the particular unit is built. The servient tenement

is described in the indenture as <i>"the Service Road"</i> and the <i>"open

space"</i> coloured brown in the plan annexed to the indenture. It is not clear from

the copies of the indenture exhibited exactly what were coloured brown. But the plaintiffs

were prepared to concede that this refers to the Land. The plaintiffs agree that the sole

question for determination is the scope of this easement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 Before making this determination, it is

necessary to set out the following facts by way of background. The conveyances of the

defendants' units were made in 1961 and 1962. The government had since acquired a part of

the original land, apparently for widening of Alexandra Road. Indeed, it was because this

or a later widening exercise caused the loss of parking space along Alexandra Road

previously enjoyed by the plaintiffs' subsidiary proprietors that prompted them to take

out this action. Therefore for almost 40 years, from 1960 to 1999, the defendants had

enjoyed continuous, uninterrupted use of the Land.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 From the survey plan exhibited by the

plaintiffs, it can be seen that the front of the defendants' buildings were constructed

right up to the boundary line of the Land. This means that the defendants' units are

landlocked and the only means of access to the public thoroughfare, Alexandra Road, was

through the Land. The plan annexed to the indenture shows a private service road built on

the Land. In front of the defendants' units this service road makes a full loop around an

unpaved oval area. There appears to be no provision for parking of vehicles apart from

parallel parking along the service road. In the course of the submissions, one of the

defendants said that at that time their cars were parked along the service road. However

this evidence was not made on affidavit although Miss Hong did not object to nor dispute

it. Nevertheless, it is an inference that can be readily drawn from the circumstances and

I so infer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 The defendants produced some evidence

that in 1977 they had been asked by the vendors, who at the time were the proprietors of

the Land, to contribute a sum of money towards the repair and upkeep of the service road.

The defendants also claimed that they had, since the conveyance of their units, been

paying for the maintenance and upkeep of the Land. Again this was not by way of affidavit,

but this was not denied by the plaintiffs. In any event, there is covenant in clause II(i)

of the indenture binding each defendant to contribute a fair sum for the maintenance of

the service road which would be consistent with the defendants' assertions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 There is a further point in respect of

clause II(i) of the indenture. For convenience, I set it out again. It covenants the

proprietor:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To contribute from time to time a fair and

  rateable proportion of the cost of maintaining and keeping in repair the Service Road

  marked Private Lot 396 and coloured brown in the said plan annexed and also all culverts

  pipes cables or water drains now or hereafter on or under the Estate the proportion in

  case of difference to be ascertained at the option of the Vendor by an arbitrator or

  arbitrators appointed for that purpose in terms of the Arbitration Ordinance <u>but only

  until the same are taken over and maintained by the Singapore City Council or other

  competent authority</u>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The service road and Private Lot 396

mentioned in this covenant relates to the Land. The words underlined suggest an intention

on the part of the vendors to eventually surrender, among other things, the service road

to the local authority for the latter to take over and maintain it. As it has turned out,

this was not done and shortly before 1982, the vendors developed Alexandra Centre of which

the Land forms a part.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 In any event it appears that part of

the original land was compulsorily acquired by the government for the widening of

Alexandra Road. What remained after acquisition comprises the Land, which became reduced

in area by about 45%. As a consequence of this the looped service road no longer exists.

In its place, the unpaved oval area appears to have been paved over and is being used for

both access to the defendants' units and the parking of their vehicles.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 It is in this context that I have to

decide the scope of the easement granted in the indenture. Miss Hong agreed that the

determination in respect of one indenture would apply in respect of the 13 other

indentures.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 Firstly it is clear that the easement

cannot operate to exclude the plaintiffs, the proprietor of the servient tenement, from

the use of their land. Accordingly, I made declarations (i) and (v). Secondly, it is also

clear that the expression <i>"to pass and repass with or without … motor cars

and other vehicles"</i> grants a right of way whether on foot or by vehicles. Hence

declaration (iv) was made.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 The remaining questions are whether the

defendants are entitled (a) to store their goods on the Land, which is the subject of

declaration (ii), and (b) to park their vehicles on the Land, the subject of declaration

(iii). I first deal with the issue of parking.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 Miss Hong does not dispute that the

right to park vehicles can be the subject of an easement. Her point is that this is not

stated in the indenture and was therefore not part of the rights granted therein. Although

it is true that it is not specifically stated in the indenture that the grantee had the

right to park vehicles on the Land, I was of the view that the words in the indenture <i>"to

enjoy the open space"</i>, in the context of the rest of the indenture as well as the

circumstances at the time of the grant, are sufficient to include the right to park

vehicles. My reasons are as follows. It is not clear whether the defendants' units were

sold before construction was underway or only after completion. But even if there were no

structures at the time of sale, the purchasers would have seen a model of the development

or, at the very least, a drawing of the site. They would have noticed the provision of the

service road, and the fact that apart from this access road there would be no other means

of access to the units and no other place to park their vehicles. The first storey units

were sold as shophouses and the second storey units as apartments for dwelling as provided

in clause II(ii) of the indenture. As is common today, it is likely that the question of

vehicular parking would have been on the minds of the purchasers. In fact clause II(i) of

the indenture obliges the proprietor to contribute towards maintenance of the service road

and appears to state that this service road would eventually be handed to the local

authority for maintenance. As it turned out, this was not only not done, but the Land was

subsequently conveyed to the plaintiffs as part of the land comprised in Alexandra Centre.

Although there is no evidence of the state of the adjoining Alexandra Road at the time, it

would not be difficult to imagine that parking would be envisaged along the service road

if it were wide enough. Such evidence as is available before me seems to indicate that it

was and that vehicles were in fact parked on it. Finally, in developing Alexandra Centre

with both Lot 2059L and the Land, the vendors had obtained the benefit of the Land even

though it is stated in clause II(i) of the indenture that the local authority would take

over and maintain it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 The question then is, in the factual

matrix before me, whether the words in the indenture, i.e.:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">to pass and repass with or without horses

  cattle and other animals carts carriages motor cars and other vehicles of every

  description along the Service Road and to enjoy the open space coloured brown in the said

  plan annexed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">are sufficiently wide to include the right to

park vehicles. I am of the view that they are, for it is inconceivable that in the

circumstances, vehicular parking would not have been provided for. Furthermore, parking of

vehicles is incidental to access by vehicles. If there were no right to park, it would

mean that the defendants were only entitled to be conveyed to their units by vehicle, such

as in a taxi. If they owned cars, they would have had to park them elsewhere and walk

back. Although the expression <i>"pass and repass"</i> by itself would not

include the right to park, I would hold that the words <i>"to enjoy the open

space"</i> in the context of the indenture and the circumstances of the case, cover

parking of vehicles consistent with the defendants' right of way over the Land.

Accordingly the defendants are entitled to the rights in declaration (iii).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 As for declaration (ii), in my view the

easement granted does not cover the use by the defendants of the Land for the purpose of

storing goods or other chattel. Such use is not incidental to the right of way over the

Land. Therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to declaration (ii).</font></p>
