In this regard, the Deceased had not discharged the onus on him to inform the defendant about his pre-existing mental condition.

There was no physical proximity between the Deceased and the alleged tortious event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the investigations and the communication of the Ban by e-mail.

A finding that the defendant acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution does not concern a breach of any term of the contract of membership <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. It is merely a finding as to whether the defendant’s exercise of its powers falls within the scope and ambit of the Constitution. The situation might have been different if the plaintiff claimed that in imposing the Ban and preventing the Deceased from participating in the defendant’s events, the defendant had breached the Constitution and impinged on the Deceased’s right therein as a member to so participate. But this was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case according to the SOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Notwithstanding this observation, the defendant does not appear to dispute that this <span class="font-italic">is</span> a contractual claim. On this basis, it could also be argued that there is an implied term at law that an association will not act beyond the powers delineated in its constitution. This was also obliquely hinted at in the case of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Shooting Association and others v Singapore Rifle Association </span>[2020] 1 SLR 395, where the Singapore Rifle Association had sought declarations that certain acts of the Singapore Shooting Association were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> its constitution.<span class="font-italic"> </span>There, the Court of Appeal noted (at [129]) that that case was “in substance really a dispute about the governance of <span class="font-italic">one </span>particular charity, [Singapore Shooting Association], and how <span class="font-italic">its</span> constitution ha[d] allegedly been breached” [emphasis in original]. Nonetheless, such an argument based on a breach of an implied term not to act beyond the defendant’s powers was not pleaded or canvassed in the plaintiff’s arguments. Indeed, the legal basis for this argument remains unclear as it has not been explicitly articulated or endorsed in the case law. I would therefore decline to make any definitive ruling in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Nevertheless, the practical implication of this distinction between a finding of <span class="font-italic">ultra </span><span class="font-italic">vires</span> and a finding of breach of contract presents itself more clearly in the context of the discussion of the remedies available, a point which I will return to later (see [98] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It should also be noted that in the SOC, the plaintiff defines the Decision as comprising the following three actions by the defendant:

</div> In any case, the plaintiff does not explain why the publication of the ExCo Statement is in and of itself <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the Constitution. The plaintiff seems to suggest that because the Ban is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution, all corresponding actions that follow from the Ban are also <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. Yet no authority is cited for such a proposition. Accordingly, I proceed with my analysis below by only evaluating the content of the Decision as pleaded in the SOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I am of the view that the only relevant parts of the Decision which fall to be governed by the contract of membership between the Deceased and the defendant are: (a) the Ban; and (b) the Notice to Partners. The filing of a police report against the Deceased stemmed from a perceived public duty on the part of the defendant, quite independent from the private law character of the contractual relationship existing between the parties. Therefore, I only proceed to consider whether the issuance of the Ban and the Notice to Partners (as opposed to the entire Decision as framed by the plaintiff) were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I begin by setting out the law concerning the power of unincorporated associations, such as the defendant, to take disciplinary action against their members. It is trite that “[a]ny rule relating to discipline, including expulsion, suspension or any other penalty, should be framed in plain and unambiguous language”: Nicholas Stewart, Natalie Campbell &amp; Simon Baughen, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Unincorporated Associations </span>(Oxford University Press, 2011) at para 6.06.

</div>
</div> The Deceased’s fundamental rights as a member of the defendant included the right to attend and participate in all meetings, workshops, tournaments and other events organised by the defendant. The Ban deprived the Deceased of these essential privileges of membership. It thus could not reasonably be suggested that the Ban and the actions taken in connection with the Ban did not affect his rights as a member simply because he remained registered as a member. Therefore, in substance, the Ban was tantamount to an expulsion or a suspension of his rights of membership.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, the Ban and the Notice to Partners cannot be neatly characterised either as an expulsion or suspension. Specifically, those actions operated to deprive the Deceased of a key aspect of his membership, pertaining to his right to participate in events organised or co-organised by the defendant. The element of permanence of the Ban distinguishes this from a suspension which contemplates a specified terminable duration. On the other hand, the concept of expulsion involves the <span class="font-italic">termination</span> of membership altogether. However, this does not seem to be the actual case on the facts. There is no evidence to suggest that the Deceased’s membership with the defendant was terminated at any point. The Ban and the Notice to Partners may be more properly described as an <span class="font-italic">exclusion</span> of the Deceased from the activities of the defendant, rather than a suspension or expulsion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 On any characterisation then, the question that remains is whether the Ban and the Notice to Partners were disciplinary or punitive measures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd (trading as Stansfield College) and another v Consumers’ Association of Singapore and another </span>[2011] 4 SLR 130 (“<span class="font-italic">The Stansfield Group</span>”), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) considered two cases, <span class="font-italic">John v Rees </span>[1970] Ch 345 (“<span class="font-italic">Rees</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Paul Wallis Furnell v Whangarei High Schools Board </span>[1973] AC 660 (“<span class="font-italic">Furnell</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Rees</span>, a suspension was held to be penally equivalent to an expulsion which was punitive in nature, whilst in <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span>, a suspension was not considered to be punitive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The case in <span class="font-italic">Rees</span> involved the authority of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party to pass a resolution to suspend the activities of the Pembrokeshire Divisional Labour Party. Megarry J, sitting in the High Court, ultimately held that the resolution was a nullity. He considered suspension to be as penal as expulsion which deprived the person concerned of the enjoyment of his rights of membership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, as observed by Prakash J, the majority of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span> arrived at a different classification of the nature of a suspension order. In that case, a teacher was suspended from his duties by the school board pending the determination of certain disciplinary charges. The teacher then instituted legal proceedings against the school board, alleging that there had been a breach of natural justice in that he had not been told that his conduct was being investigated and had not been given an opportunity to be heard prior to the suspension order being made. It is pertinent to note that a suspension was not classified as a penalty under the relevant legislation or regulations. The Privy Council upheld the New Zealand Court of Appeal’s decision that the rules of natural justice had not been breached, and that it was not unfair in the circumstances for the board to have exercised its discretion to suspend the teacher without giving him an opportunity to be heard. It is helpful to set out the following passage from the judgment of Lord Morris, who delivered the majority decision of the Privy Council (at 682F–683B): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is next necessary to consider whether there was any unfairness on the part of the board, as was strongly suggested in the submissions made on behalf of the appellant. Though the board followed faithfully the directions of the regulations <span class="font-italic">it is said that nevertheless they should give a teacher an opportunity of being heard before they decide to suspend. Neither in the regulations nor in the Act is suspension classified as a penalty. Section 157(3) shows that it is not</span>. It must however be recognised that suspension may involve hardship. During suspension salary is not paid and apart from this something of a temporary slur may be involved if a teacher is suspended. But the regulations (by regulation 5) clearly contemplate or lay it down that the written statement of a teacher (under regulation 5(2) and the oral personal statement of a regulation 5(3)) will be made after suspension if any has taken place. Suspension is discretionary. <span class="font-italic">Decisions as to whether to suspend will often be difficult. Members of a board who are appointed or elected to act as the governing body of a school must in the exercise of their responsibilities have regard not only to the interests of teachers but to the interests of pupils and of parents and of the public. There may be occasions when having regard to the nature of a charge it will be wise, in the interests of all concerned, that pending decision whether the charge is substantiated a teacher should be suspended from duty</span>. In many cases it can be assumed that charges would be denied and that only after a full hearing could the true position be ascertained. It is not to be assumed that a board, constituted as it is, will wantonly exercise its discretion. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 After considering <span class="font-italic">Rees </span>and <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span>, Prakash J concluded that there was case authority to support the proposition that whether the act of suspending a person from a position in the association or membership is penal or not, ultimately depends on the circumstances of the case. In particular, she observed that these circumstances included (<span class="font-italic">The Stansfield Group</span> at [90]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">whether the regulations involved expressly classify suspension as a penalty or not and what the purpose of the suspension is. It may also be a matter of significance as to whether the suspending authority is charged with protecting the interests of third parties</span>. This seems to be a significant difference between the cases of <span class="font-italic">Burn</span> and <span class="font-italic">Rees</span> on the one hand and <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span> on the other. In the first two cases, the union was considering its own interests and the conduct of the member concerned when it decided to suspend him from membership. In <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span>, the school board was investigating a complaint and thus considering the conduct of Mr Furnell but it also had to consider the interests of pupils and their parents and of the public and how these should be protected whilst the investigations were taking their course. The existence of such third party interests was a vital factor in persuading the Privy Council that suspension was invoked as a protective measure rather than a penal one. As important would be the purpose of the suspension, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it is considered an end in itself or is intended to provide a period in which something else can be accomplished, in the <span class="font-italic">Furnell</span> case that something else being the full investigation into the charges which could have resulted either in the complete exoneration and reinstatement of Mr Furnell or in his being subjected to a punishment. There is no indication from either <span class="font-italic">Burn</span> or <span class="font-italic">Rees</span> that in those cases it was intended that certain action be taken during the period of suspension which might result in either the lifting of the suspension or in the application of another sanction. In fact in <span class="font-italic">Rees</span> itself, the court emphasised that the practical result of the suspension there was indistinguishable from expulsion. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 To my mind, Prakash J’s observations in the context of suspensions apply equally to the present case concerning what I would consider to be an exclusion. It is thus necessary to examine the circumstances of the present case in order to determine whether the Ban and the Notice to Partners were penal and therefore <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I consider first the purpose of the Ban and the Notice to Partners.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, both Arts 8.1 and 15 of the Constitution do not set out in express terms any power of the ExCo or a general meeting of members to take disciplinary action with penal consequences against a member of the defendant. Article 8.1 simply establishes the makeup of the ExCo, which is charged with the general administration of the defendant. It says nothing more on any specific powers to take disciplinary action against members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Article 15 of the Constitution similarly does not make reference to any disciplinary powers of the ExCo or a general meeting of members. In fact, as the plaintiff points out, a similar provision was considered in the cases of <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng v Chu Sheng Temple </span>[2015] SGHC 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng</span>, Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) considered whether Art XIII of the defendant temple’s constitution allowed for the expulsion of members. Article XIII read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event of any question or matter arising out of any point which is not expressly provided for in the Constitution, the Committee shall have power to convene a meeting to solve the problem or to use its own discretion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Abdullah JC held (at [52]) that Art XIII was not broad enough on a plain reading to encompass the power to expel. He observed that the provision appeared to be “primarily geared to allow the management committee to have facilitative powers for the continued running and operation of the [defendant temple]”. He went on to state that the “expulsion of a member is a drastic and serious action” which could not “be easily founded on a broad provision of this nature”. Further, it was noteworthy that the title of the provision was “Interpretation”, which while not determinative, further reinforced the conclusion that the article was merely facilitative and did not give any power to expel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>, Pang JC considered whether the defendant (Singapore Shooting Association) was empowered under Arts 6.4, 8.1 and 16.1 of its constitution to suspend the privileges of the plaintiff (Singapore Rifle Association). The relevant articles read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. MEMBERSHIP FEES</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.4  If a member falls into arrears with its subscriptions or other dues, it shall be informed immediately by the Treasurer. If it fails to settle its arrears within 4 weeks of their becoming due, the President may order that its name be posted on the Association’s notice board and that if be denied the privileges of membership until the account is settled. If arrears are overdue for more than 3 months, the organisation will automatically cease to be a member and the Council may take legal action against the organisation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. MANAGEMENT AND COUNCIL </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.1 The administration and management of the Association shall be entrusted to a Council consisting of the following to be elected at alternate Annual General Meeting: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16. INTERPRETATION</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16.1 In the event of any question or matter arising out of any point which is not expressly provided for in this Constitution, the Council shall have the power to use its own discretion. The decision of the Council shall be final unless it is reversed at a General Meeting of members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Pang JC noted (at [40]) that nothing on the face of these provisions empowered the defendant to suspend the plaintiff’s privileges. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Art</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">icle 6.4 referred to suspension of a member’s privileges only on the ground that the member had fallen into arrears with its subscription or other dues, which was not engaged in that case. Article 8.1 merely entrusted the council with the administration and management of the defendant, which had to be performed in accordance with the constitution, and could not be read as allowing the council to create powers for itself which the constitution did not confer. Article 16.1 also made no express reference to any power of suspension.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I agree with the above observations of Abdullah JC in <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng</span> and Pang JC in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span> which are equally applicable to the present case. Further, to my mind, the defendant’s suggestion to construe actions of a disciplinary nature as pertaining to matters of day-to-day administration stretches the definition of the latter beyond reasonable interpretation. I consider that disciplinary actions with penal consequences would not routinely arise as part of the defendant’s day-to-day administration in running its activities for its members. The present case appears to have been the sole instance. At any rate, no evidence was led of any similar actions that were taken by the defendant on a routine or day-to-day basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Whether a term can be implied into the Constitution to empower the defendant to impose the Ban and communicate the Notice to Partners</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the alternative, the defendant submits that even if the Constitution did not expressly provide for the defendant to make the Decision (including the Ban and the Notice to Partners), it is implied in the Constitution that the ExCo “has the power to take all necessary preventive and/or remedial actions to protect the safety of its members, particularly when such members are minors”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Implied Term.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The test for implication of terms in fact is set out in the seminal case of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal laid down a three-step process (at [101]) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the first step, the court is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap at the time of contracting. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the third step, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract. Where such a clear response is not forthcoming, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff argues that a line of Singapore case authorities support the proposition that no disciplinary or penal powers can be implied into the Constitution (see <span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1267 at [46]–[47]; <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng </span>at [55]; and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association </span>at [41]). But the process of implying terms in a contract is in fact a highly fact-dependent one. This was stressed by the court in <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at [41]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is important to note that the tests considered above relate to the possible implication of a <span class="font-italic">particular </span>term or terms into <span class="font-italic">particular</span> contracts. In other words, the court concerned would examine the <span class="font-italic">particular factual</span><span class="font-italic"> matrix</span> concerned in order to ascertain whether or not a term ought to be implied. … There are practical consequences to such an approach, the most important of which is that the implication of a term or terms in a particular contract <span class="font-italic">creates no precedent for future cases</span>. In other words, the court is only concerned about arriving at a just and fair result via implication of the term or terms in question in that case – <span class="font-italic">and that case alone</span>. The court is only concerned about the presumed intention of the particular contracting parties – <span class="font-italic">and those particular parties alone</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I am of the view that in the present case, the test for implication in <span class="font-italic">Sem</span><span class="font-italic">bcorp</span> is not satisfied. In particular, the Implied Term fails to satisfy the “officious bystander” test as reflected in the third step of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> process for implication. In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>(at [98]), it was observed by the Court of Appeal that “a term that is not reasonable, not equitable, unclear, or that contradicts an express term of the contract, will not be implied” as it would “necessarily fail the officious bystander test”. The Implied Term suggested by the defendant that the <span class="font-italic">ExCo</span> has the “power to take <span class="font-italic">all</span> <span class="font-italic">necessary preventive and/or remedial actions</span> to protect the safety of its members, particularly when such members are minors” [emphasis added], envisages an exceedingly broad discretionary power vested in a small group of members of the defendant. The ambit of this power is unclear and unspecific. Moreover, given the breadth of such a power, it is difficult to see how the members of the defendant would have considered it so obvious that the <span class="font-italic">ExCo</span> (and not a general meeting of the members) would be able to wield such power. This is especially so given that such a power may extend to the taking of disciplinary action against a particular member, even including drastic measures like suspension and expulsion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Therefore, I am of the view that the defendant acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution in imposing the Ban and communicating the Notice to Partners. Consequently, it is not necessary to consider the plaintiff’s further arguments that: (a) even if the Constitution empowered the defendant to take disciplinary action, the power was vested in a general meeting of the members, and not the ExCo; and (b) in any event, none of the actions taken against the Deceased were properly authorised by a resolution of the ExCo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Ban and the Notice to Partners were issued in breach of the rules of natural justice and therefore invalid</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Unlike the plaintiff’s arguments above concerning whether the defendant acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>the Constitution, the plaintiff’s argument based on natural justice is properly founded in a claim for breach of contract. The basis for this was explained in <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club </span>[2008] SGHC 143 (“<span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin (AD)</span>”) at [33] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Mdm Kay’s claim properly understood is one in breach of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that the SICC had wrongfully suspended her membership in breach of the terms of contract found in the constitution and rules of the club. There is a ‘judicial review’ of the decision of the GC of the club to the extent of questioning whether it is in line with the rules of natural justice for the purpose of determining if there had been a breach of the contract, such natural justice rules being either expressly or in this case impliedly provided for under the contract in the form of the SICC’s constitution. The principles of administrative law that were applied by the Court of Appeal, such as the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> principle and those relating to the irrationality of the decision-making process, can therefore be seen as being applied by analogy to a private law context for the purpose of deciphering whether there had indeed been a breach of contract. Properly conceived, the claim for damages hence arises from a contractual breach, and it is therefore to the contractual principles of damages that recourse should be had in assessing the quantum of damages that is payable in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As explained further in <span class="font-italic">Khong</span><span class="font-italic"> Kin Hoong Lawrence v Singapore Polo Club </span>[2014] 3 SLR 241, Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) observed at [23] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rules of natural justice are universal rules that govern the conduct of human behaviour. These rules are widely accepted to be of paramount importance. Contracting parties accept the rules of natural justice as obvious terms which are often not mentioned in their contract. Hence, courts assume that parties must have intended these rules to govern their contractual terms even if the contract is silent as to such rules. Therefore the rules of natural justice are implied terms of the contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The rules of natural justice require the Defendant to act fairly against its members, such as the Plaintiff, especially when the disciplinary proceedings may result in sanctions. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng and another v Singapore Swimming Club </span>[2015] 3 SLR 541 at [41], the court observed that the rules of natural justice can be recast as a duty to act fairly in all the circumstances of the case. There are two main pillars to the rules of natural justice: (a) the rule against bias; and (b) the fair hearing rule. In <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 802 (“<span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin</span>”) at [7], the Court of Appeal explained these pillars of natural justice as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A duty to act fairly involves a duty to act impartially. Procedural fairness requires that the decision-maker should not be biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration being given to the arguments or evidence presented by the parties: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 10.050. It is also a cardinal principle of natural justice that no man shall be condemned unheard. Compliance with the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem</span> rule requires that the party liable to be directly affected by the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings should be given notice of the allegation against him and should be given a fair opportunity to be heard. Notice includes notice of any evidence put before the tribunal. It is a breach of natural justice for evidence to be received behind the back of the party concerned: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 10.060. It will generally be a denial of justice to fail to disclose to that party specific material relevant to the decision if he is thereby deprived of an opportunity to comment on such material. Similarly, if a tribunal, after the close of the hearing, comes into possession of further evidence, the party affected should be invited to comment upon it: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 10.061.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin</span> also noted that the content of this duty to act fairly varies with the circumstances of the case (at [6]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Certain factors will increase the likelihood of the principles being applied rigorously, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where there is an express duty to decide only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, or where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his property rights or impose a penalty on him. All disciplinary bodies have a duty to act fairly as expulsion, suspension or other punishment or the casting of a stigma may be involved: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span>at para 10.049. What fairness requires and what is involved in order to achieve fairness is for the decision of the courts as a matter of law. The issue is not one for the discretion of the decision-maker: see <span class="font-italic">De Smith’s</span> at para 7-009, p 361.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I now turn to consider whether there was a breach of the fair hearing rule and the rule against bias on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether there was a breach of the fair hearing rule </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is undisputed that the Deceased was not given the opportunity to address the allegations made against him or to defend himself against the Ban, the Notice to Partners and/or the ExCo Statement, neither was he informed of the investigations taken prior to these actions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In Cherylyn’s AEIC at para 45, she acknowledged that “[the Deceased] had not been given the opportunity to explain himself prior to the issuance of the public statement.” This was echoed in Vihasini’s AEIC at para 26, where she similarly agreed that “[the Deceased] was not given the chance to explain himself prior to the publication of the EXCO Statement”. This was repeated during her cross-examination where she stated that “[the Deceased] wasn’t heard before the [ExCo Statement] went out”.

The suspension without first affording an opportunity to be heard, of a Romanian Airline’s flight permit, following the failure by five of its pilots of Civil Aviation Authority examinations in aviation law, flight rules, and procedures, was not unfair where an immediate threat to air safety was apprehended.

</div> At the material time, it was also undisputed that the Deceased was an active member of the defendant (albeit no longer a director of the DDI programme). As such, a degree of urgency in imposing the Ban and communicating the Notice to Partners, amongst other things, was required to ensure the safety of the participants of the defendant’s programmes. Here, it is important to note that the reason for the Ban was really centred on the contents of the Darkness Chat Group and <span class="font-italic">not</span> the allegations raised by Hanniel – this was made clear in the Ban Notification sent to the Deceased.

</div> In my view, it did not matter that the allegations against the Deceased were allegations from some time in the past. They were objectively serious allegations and more importantly, the Deceased was still involved with and in close contact with minors participating in the defendant’s activities (and the activities of other partner organisations).

</div> Given that there was no express indication to the Deceased that he was allowed to make representations and/or appeal the Decision and that there was also no indication that the Deceased had contemplated such a possibility at the time, I am of the view that the rules of natural justice still applied in the present case. The fair hearing rule, in particular, was breached. This is so even if I accept the defendant’s argument that the rules of natural justice applied with less rigour; given that the breaches in the present case concerned the <span class="font-italic">fundamental </span>features of the fair hearing rule, none of which were complied with.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether there was a breach of the rule against bias </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To recapitulate, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the rule against bias by demonstrating apparent bias in the proceedings leading up to the Ban. The applicable principles in relation to the doctrine of apparent bias were restated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOI v BOJ </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">BOI</span>”) at [103] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicable test is whether there are circumstances that would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias in the fair-minded and informed observer. This is not any different from asking whether the observer would conclude that there was a “real possibility” of bias, bearing in mind that the word “real” here refers to the degree of likelihood of bias (which must be substantial and not imagined), and not whether the bias is actual. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As the test for apparent bias involves a hypothetical inquiry into the perspective of the observer and what the observer would think of a particular set of circumstances, the test is necessarily objective. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A reasonable suspicion or apprehension arises when the observer would think, from the relevant circumstances, that bias is possible. It cannot be a fanciful belief, and the reasons for the suspicion must be capable of articulation by reference to the evidence presented. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In establishing whether the observer would harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias, the court must be mindful not to supplant the observer’s perspective by assuming knowledge outside the ken of reasonably well-informed members of the public (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, detailed knowledge of the law and court procedure, or insider knowledge of the inclinations, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">character or ability of the members of the court or adjudication body). The observer would be informed – that is, he or she would be apprised of all relevant facts that are capable of being known by members of the public generally. The observer would also be fair-minded; he or she would be neither complacent nor unduly sensitive and suspicious. He or she would know the traditions of integrity and impartiality that administrators of justice have to uphold, and would not jump to hasty conclusions of bias based on isolated episodes of temper or remarks taken out of context. </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In line with (d), the relevant circumstances which the court may take into account in finding a reasonable suspicion of bias would be limited to what is available to an observer witnessing the proceedings. Such circumstances might include, for example, the demeanour of the judge and counsel, the interactions between the court and counsel, and such facts of the case as could be gleaned from those interactions and/or known to the general public.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In addition, the rule against prejudgment prohibits the decision-maker from reaching a final, conclusive decision before being made aware of all relevant evidence and arguments which the parties wish to put before him or her. The primary objection against prejudgment is the surrender by a decision-making body of its judgment such that it approaches the matter with a closed mind (<span class="font-italic">BOI </span>at [107]). While it has been said that prejudgment is distinct from (though related to) apparent bias, the Court of Appeal observed that the preponderance of authority has referred to prejudgment as something that amounts to apparent bias (<span class="font-italic">BOI </span>at [108]). Accordingly, in <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">order to establish prejudgment amounting to apparent bias, it must be established that the fair-minded, informed and reasonable observer would, after considering the facts a</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">nd circumstances available before him, suspect or apprehend that the decision-maker had reached a final and conclusive decision before being made aware of all relevant evidence and arguments which the parties wish to put before him or her, such that he or she approaches the matter at hand with a closed mind (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">BOI </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [109]). </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Flowing from my views expressed above, the plain and obvious inference is that the defendant had prejudged the Deceased. This inference can be reasonably drawn from the fact that the defendant did not ask to receive or consider any evidence from the Deceased before deciding on the Decision (including the Ban and the Notice to Partners). This is further underscored by Vihasini’s AEIC at para 23, where she stated emphatically but perhaps presumptuously that, “there was <span class="font-italic">simply no fathomable explanation</span> that [the Deceased] could have mustered to justify his actions, <span class="font-italic">even if given the opportunity to do so</span>” [emphasis added]. Having also concluded that the exception to the application of the rules of natural justice (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the common law exception of urgency) does not apply in the present case, I am of the view that this prejudgment by the defendant amounted to apparent bias.                                                                                                                                                                                                 </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Ban and the Notice to Partners were issued irrationally, capriciously and in bad faith and therefore invalid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It is not strictly necessary to consider this argument by the plaintiff, which is founded on the defendant having acted unreasonably within the rubric of the administrative law concept of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonableness.

At this juncture, I note that damages may only be sought in relation to a finding of a <span class="font-italic">breach of contract</span>. In the present case, arguably, the plaintiff might be entitled to claim for damages in relation to the finding that there was a breach of natural justice. The basis for this would be that the rules of natural justice are implied terms of the Constitution, which constitutes the contract of membership between the Deceased and the defendant (see [75] above). However, a finding that the Ban and the Notice to Partners were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution stands on a separate footing, as this finding is <span class="font-italic">not</span> grounded in a private law claim (in particular, a breach of contract) which entitles the plaintiff to damages. As such, only a declaration may be available as a remedy (see [111]–[117] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Therefore, I only consider the plaintiff’s claim for damages in relation to the finding above that the defendant breached the rules of natural justice in imposing the Ban and communicating the Notice to Partners. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Nevertheless, even if I accept that the Deceased did suffer from some form of mental distress, and without first delving into the concepts of causation and remoteness, it is evidently clear that this is a claim for non-pecuniary loss. In <span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2017] 1 SLR 918 at [53], the Court of Appeal held that substantial awards of damages for non-pecuniary loss arising from reputational damage and mental distress are generally contrary to policy:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In general, the law of contract concerns itself with the remediation of pecuniary damage, and the scope for recovering damages for non-pecuniary loss in contract is greatly limited. This is the reason for the well-established rule that the law of contract does not <span class="font-italic">generally</span> award recovery for reputational damage and mental distress arising from a breach of contract … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 That being said, as the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) highlight at para 21.121, “[i]t has long been accepted that the reluctance of the courts to award damages in compensation of non-pecuniary losses in the form of mental distress may be overcome given appropriate facts”. In particular, recovery for mental distress is possible where the specific object of the contract was to provide pleasure and enjoyment, but the exact opposite resulted instead because of a breach of contract. Bingham LJ in <span class="font-italic">Watts v Morrow </span>[1991] 1 WLR 1421 (“<span class="font-italic">Watts</span>”) at 1445 described the exception to the recovery of non-pecuniary losses as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But the rule is not absolute. Where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom from molestation, damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is procured instead. If the law did not cater for this exceptional category of case it would be defective. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Subsequently, in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Farley v Skinner </span>[2001] 3 WLR 899 (“<span class="font-italic">Farley</span>”), the court held that it is sufficient that the provision of “mental benefits” is a major or important object of the contract. In other words, it need not be the sole or entire purpose of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the present case, the plaintiff argues that “[a]n important object of the contract was to provide the mental development and/or satisfaction which a member of the defendant may enjoy through attending and/or participating in such events”. Thus, the contract of membership fell within the class of contracts providing for “mental benefits” as contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Farley</span>.

</div> In particular, the assistant registrar held (at [79]) that “[r]ecovery in the present case is only permissible because the [Singapore Island Country Club] membership constitutes a contract which has as its central focus the provision of pleasure, enjoyment and other ‘mental benefits’”. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin (AD)</span>, the assistant registrar noted (at [74]) that counsel for the club “did not appear to contend that the membership contract [was] not one to provide pleasure and enjoyment”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 To my mind, the provision of “mental benefits”, including pleasure and enjoyment as contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Watts</span> and <span class="font-italic">Farley</span>, was neither a major nor an important object of the contract of membership in the present case.

They say nothing about the specific provision of mental benefits, pleasure and enjoyment to individual members. It cannot thus be contemplated that the very object of the membership contract was to provide such benefits. It is quite irrelevant whether the Deceased himself sought to obtain such mental benefits, including mental development, pleasure or personal enjoyment from debating, from his membership with the defendant. It is possible that he may have subjectively derived such collateral benefits, but it goes too far to treat this as one of the objects of his contract of membership with the defendant. The present case is wholly unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin (AD)</span>, where the membership in question was a Singapore Island Country Club membership which entitled the plaintiff as a fee-paying member to enjoy the club’s various facilities which provided “pleasure, relaxation and comfort”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Further, it should be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin (AD)</span>, the assistant registrar had also considered (at [73]) the case of <span class="font-italic">Haron</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic Association</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 494. In that case, the defendant was an association of several sports clubs, which was vested with the power and responsibility to “promote, arrange and assist amateur athletic competitions and championships for the benefit of affiliates and foreign teams desirous of visiting the Republic of Singapore and to employ the funds of the association to this purpose and to promote athletics in general”. The defendant’s object was thus to promote competitive sports/athletics and the concomitant social good. This was recognised by the assistant registrar who determined that since the case involved the suspension of a member of an athletics association, where the relationship between the association and its members could not be said to be one which had as its object the provision of “mental benefits”, the exception was therefore not triggered and the general rule thus prevailed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Accordingly, I am of the view that the exception to the general rule is similarly not triggered in the present case, and the plaintiff is not entitled to his claim for general damages for mental distress purportedly caused to the Deceased by the defendant’s breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Damages for any loss attributable to the death of the Deceased on the basis that his death was caused by the defendant’s breach of contract </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In addition, the plaintiff submits that pursuant to ss 20 and 21 of the CLA, the Deceased’s dependants are entitled to claim damages for any loss attributable to the death of the Deceased on the basis that his death was caused by the defendant’s breach of contract and for bereavement. For the purpose of these provisions, the dependants of the Deceased are: (a) the plaintiff (as the father of the Deceased); and (b) Mdm Silvia Bridget Loh Gek Hui (“Mdm Loh”) (as the mother of the Deceased).

No precedent was cited by the plaintiff to show that our courts have granted a mandatory injunction requiring the correction of a published statement.

This stands on a different footing and is of a different character from an order “compelling a defendant to merely withdraw, or correct, an offending statement after a trial”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the present case, the defendant has contested the entirety of the plaintiff’s claim.

That being said, given my finding that the defendant had breached the rules of natural justice, I venture to suggest that it would not be out of order for the defendant to consider extending an apology to the plaintiff and his family in the spirit of reconciliation.

</div> In my view, <span class="font-italic">Excel Golf</span> is of limited assistance to the defendant. Ultimately, the judge’s conclusion was based on the fact that the plaintiff’s counsel in that case did not cite to the court any direct authority in support of the proposition that a court had the power in such cases to order that an apology be published and that para 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) gave the court that power (at [8]–[9]). However, to my mind, while the court in <span class="font-italic">Excel Golf</span> had declined to order the publication of an apology due to the lack of case authorities, it does not follow that the court had taken the definitive position that it <span class="font-italic">did not</span> have the power to do so – whether such an order was appropriate in law was thus a question that was left open in that case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claim in the tort of negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I next turn to the plaintiff’s claim in the tort of negligence.

In the present case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving on the balance of probabilities that the defendant’s breach of duty as alleged above caused the Deceased to suffer from the alleged harm of an ASR, a recognised psychiatric illness.

This was not pleaded in the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The upshot is that the plaintiff has adduced no evidence in support of whether the purported breaches of duty in (a) and (b) above were in any way causative of the Deceased’s ASR.

</div> This statement was telling as it reflected the complete lack of any actual observable symptoms that Dr Ng could have relied on to make a sound reasoned assessment.

With respect, Dr Ng assumed the very conclusion that she sought to establish (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>. that the Deceased suffered an ASR) primarily if not wholly by pointing to the fact that the Deceased had taken his own life. Dr Ng had not adequately explained how she came to her diagnosis of ASR other than to maintain that the Deceased was “obviously very distressed” such that this led him to commit suicide. In the circumstances, while I can accept that the Deceased must have suffered considerable distress following the Ban Notification and the publication of the ExCo Statement, I find it difficult to conclude that the plaintiff has proved on the balance of probabilities that the Deceased suffered from a recognisable psychiatric illness at the material time prior to his demise.

The defendant breached this alleged duty by the manner in which it communicated and publicised the allegations against the Deceased and the outcome of the investigations through the ExCo Statement (see [130] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Generally, the standard of care is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill: Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts</span>”) at para 06.006.

</div> In relation to (a) and (b), I am of the view that the details provided were in fact the minimum necessary to ensure that the affected persons could reach out to seek assistance if required, in line with the purpose of the ExCo Statement. In fact, it is incontrovertible and undisputed by the plaintiff that the ExCo Statement itself did not contain the Deceased’s name. The identifiers included in the ExCo Statement would have allowed his identity to be known only to those persons who needed to know such information (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the students affected and members of the debate community who may have been affected). If there had been any intent, whether express or tacit, to inform the general public at large, conceivably far more identifiers would have been included. It is important to also consider the platforms on which the ExCo Statement was published. They were confined to only those sites associated with the defendant or related to debating in Singapore (see [7] above). It thus can be seen that steps were taken to ensure that the ExCo Statement was made accessible to those whom the defendant was seeking to protect and that the Deceased’s identity and his privacy interests were also sought to be protected. This was a delicate balance to achieve and I do not think that the defendant was careless in its attempt to strike a reasonable balance.

</div> While this could arguably be said to reflect poor judgment on the part of the defendant, not all errors of judgment result in liability in negligence.

Such intention “excludes not merely negligently harmful statements, but also recklessly harmful statements” (<span class="font-italic">Rhodes </span>at [113]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, a consequence element which requires that the claimant suffered “physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness” (<span class="font-italic">Rhodes </span>at [73]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In my view, as explained above, the plaintiff has failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the Deceased suffered from an ASR. It must follow that the plaintiff’s claim in tort under the rule in <span class="font-italic">Wilkinson v Downton</span> is bound to fail based on that finding alone as the consequence element would not be satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In any event, the plaintiff did not plead the mental element in the SOC. Nowhere does the plaintiff plead the material fact that the defendant possessed the <span class="font-italic">intention</span> to cause physical harm or severe mental or emotional distress to the Deceased. The only portion of the SOC that comes close to this is at para 20(c) in relation to the allegation of apparent bias, where it is pleaded that: “Cherylyn Wee caused the EXCO Statement to be published with the malign intention and/or ulterior motive of tarnishing the deceased’s reputation.” This does not plead with sufficient particularity that the defendant (as distinct from Cherylyn, the defendant’s president at the time) possessed the intention to cause <span class="font-italic">severe mental or emotional distress</span> to the Deceased (as opposed to the intention to tarnish his reputation). Moreover, over the course of the trial and in closing submissions, the plaintiff did not pursue the pleaded point in para 20(c) of the SOC that Cherylyn allegedly had a strained relationship with the Deceased and had thus acted with improper motives. The plaintiff in fact conceded under cross-examination that no such evidence of a strained relationship was produced.

This was grounded in ensuring the safety of the members of the defendant and other participants of the defendant’s programmes, as well as discharging its responsibility and accountability to stakeholders (see [60], [87] and [152] above), in the face of objective evidence in the form of the Darkness Chat Group logs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The Darkness Chat Group logs reveal a host of sexually-charged exchanges. Perhaps some might be prepared to dismiss them as inconsequential frivolous banter among “hormonal teenagers”, adopting the words of Celia Leo (“Celia”), a witness for the plaintiff, who was at one point a participant in the Darkness Chat Group.

</div> But even if these exchanges were never meant to be taken seriously, they were nevertheless highly inappropriate. The Deceased, being the only adult who “led” the Darkness Chat Group which he created, was initiating discussions in a private chat as a “safe space” and purportedly “moderating” the sexualised content among a group of minors.

</div> The discussions were, by the plaintiff’s own admission, sexually provocative and tended to centre on the objectification of persons who might (or might not) be considered sexually attractive. The discussions included comments about the private parts of a DDI member, discussions about the sexual acts of other participants and pressure on a minor to disclose details of a personal romantic/sexual encounter.

</div> to identify the Deceased as the former DDI Director accused of misconduct. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The ExCo Statement contained false and misleading information which severely prejudiced the Deceased. In particular, it created the false and misleading impression that the decision to impose the Ban and file a police report was made following an independent and comprehensive investigation which included giving the Deceased an opportunity to defend the charges brought against him. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The messages exchanged in the DAS Equity Chat Group on 6 August 2018 suggested that Cherylyn, Reuben and Vihasini intended to maximise the negative exposure and disruption for the Deceased which would follow from the publication of the ExCo Statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The messages exchanged in the DAS Equity Chat Group from the morning of 9 August 2018 suggested that Cherylyn, Reuben and Vihasini felt no remorse over the death of the Deceased as they were focused only on being politically correct and on damage control. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The defendant took steps to notify Enterprise, the defendant’s partner associations, and teachers of the schools who had student participants in the DDI, of the ExCo Statement and the allegations contained therein, notwithstanding that it was unreasonable to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I am not satisfied that the points enumerated above necessarily give rise to the inexorable inference that the defendant intended at the material time in issuing the Ban Notification and publishing the ExCo Statement to cause severe mental or emotional distress to the Deceased. The ExCo Statement was deliberated upon before publication. The contents were not exaggerated or sensationalised. Arguably, the mention in the ExCo Statement of an “independent audit” and “comprehensive report of the findings” may suggest that the Deceased’s response was obtained and duly considered. But at most, this was a possible inference that could be drawn; it was never specifically represented in the ExCo Statement that such was the case. As such, while some points in the ExCo Statement could have been set out more clearly and precisely, I do not accept that there was any intent for the ExCo Statement to convey false or misleading information.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 To my mind, the <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> intention of the defendant was simply and primarily to ensure the safety of its members and the student participants of its activities. As highlighted above at [153], steps were taken to limit the potential for the Deceased to be readily identified other than by those persons or entities who might have needed to know such information. The reference in Reuben’s message in the DAS Equity Chat Group to “anyone with half a brain” being able to identify the Deceased should be understood in this narrower context. Reuben’s reference to “anyone with half a brain” was mere hyperbole. It would not have referred literally to any person outside the debating circle (“with half a brain”) who chanced upon the ExCo Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As for the content and tone of the messages in the DAS Equity Chat Group on 6 August 2018, they appeared to reflect perhaps an overblown sense of indignation amidst the atmosphere of heightened tension prior to the defendant’s issuance of the ExCo Statement. I would not read much more into these messages to infer any malicious or spiteful intent. In relation to the messages exchanged on 9 August 2018 after the Deceased’s passing, it would not be appropriate to infer a lack of remorse from the exchanges.

</div> or to suggest that they were actually making light of the situation. The exchanges in the DAS Equity Chat Group should be viewed in perspective for what they were, as free-flowing, brief and informal online conversations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 If anything, the sum total of the facts above which the plaintiff relies upon only demonstrates that the defendant was at most reckless or negligent as to whether its actions would cause the Deceased severe mental or emotional distress. I am not persuaded that the plaintiff has shown that these facts suffice to show that there was intent to cause such distress to the Deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 In summary, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s claim in tort under the rule in <span class="font-italic">Wilkinson v Downton </span>is unsustainable as all three of the requisite elements (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the conduct, mental and consequence elements) are not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Having reviewed the findings in the Audit Report, the defendant decided to prioritise the safety and protection of its members, especially those who were minors. Its primary motivation was to act responsibly, decisively and swiftly in taking preventive and remedial measures. The defendant’s decision cannot be faulted in this regard. But in taking the steps the defendant did, the need for the Deceased to be afforded his right to be heard and to avoid apparent bias through prejudgment was unfortunately obscured. The process was thus unfair and prejudicial to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 For the above reasons, I allow the plaintiff’s claim in part. I grant declarations that the Ban and the Notice to Partners were unlawful as they were issued <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the Constitution and in breach of the rules of natural justice. It follows that a further order will be granted to set aside the Ban and the Notice to Partners. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The plaintiff has not succeeded in proving all the other claims. I dismiss all the remaining claims, encompassing the other claims founded on contract, on the tort of negligence and under the rule in <span class="font-italic">Wilkinso</span><span class="font-italic">n v Downton</span>. In particular, the plaintiff’s claim for damages in contract is dismissed on the ground that damages for mental distress are not usually granted for contractual claims. In addition, I find that the plaintiff has not succeeded in establishing any basis for the claim for damages in tort as it has not been shown on the balance of probabilities that the Deceased suffered from an ASR and consequently that this had caused him to end his own life. The plaintiff has thus not succeeded in the majority of the pleaded claims. This outcome would have been avoided had the plaintiff elected to focus with greater circumspection on a narrower scope of claims instead of casting the net as far and wide as possible, as it were. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 I shall hear the parties’ submissions on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Paul Ong Min-Tse (Paul Ong Chambers LLC)</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Darren Tan Tho Eng, Silas Siew Wei Ying and Joshua Tan Ming En (Invictus Law Corporation)</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
