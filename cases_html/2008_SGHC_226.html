<p class="Judg-author" xmlns=""></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Introduction</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       This dispute arose from Over &amp; Over Ltd’s (“Over &amp; Over”) claim for relief against oppressive and/or unfairly prejudicial conduct under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Over &amp; Over is a minority shareholder of Richvein Pte Ltd (“Richvein”), which is the second defendant. At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed Over &amp; Over’s claim. Over &amp; Over has filed an appeal. I now provide my written reasons.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Background</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2       Over &amp; Over, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, is an investment vehicle of the Lauw family. Lauw Siang Liong (“LSL”) and John Loh (“JL”) are the only shareholders and directors of Over &amp; Over, JL being LSL’s son.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3       Bonvests Holdings Ltd (“Bonvests”), the first defendant, is a company listed on Singapore Exchange Limited with approximately 59.68% of its shares held by Goldvein Holdings Pte Ltd (“Goldvein”). In turn, Goldvein is a company controlled by the Sianandar family. Henry Ngo (“HN”) and Dijtu Sianandar (“DS”), who are brothers, are members of the Sianandar family.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       Sometime in 1978, the Sianandar family was considering buying a piece of land along Scotts Road to develop a hotel. Through a mutual business associate, DS and LSL met each other and expressed interest in participating in a joint venture to develop that piece of land. There were some discussions (the extent to which is in dispute) between the two families in relation to the proposed joint venture.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5       Further to these discussions, Richvein was incorporated on 20 August 1980 as a joint venture company between Over &amp; Over and Bonvests. At the beginning, 70% of the shares of Richvein were held by Unicurrent Finance Limited (“Unicurrent”) and 30% of the shares of Richvein were held by Over &amp; Over. Unicurrent is an investment holding company incorporated in Hong Kong and is owned by the Sianandar family (with 99% of its shares held by HN and the remaining 1% held by DS). Unicurrent subsequently transferred one share to BHL Investments Pte Ltd (which is a company owned by the Sianandar family)</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 1]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. On 23 September 2003, the 70% shareholding (less one share) originally held by Unicurrent was transferred to Bonvests</font><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 2]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. This transfer to Bonvests is one of the grievances of Over &amp; Over as I shall elaborate on later.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6       After Richvein was incorporated, it purchased the land at Scotts Road and developed a hotel on it known as Sheraton Towers Singapore. The construction of the hotel was completed in December 1985 and the hotel has operated on the premises since then. Sheraton Towers Singapore is Richvein’s sole business and main asset.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7       During the trial, Over &amp; Over called on JL and LSL as their witnesses. Bonvests called on HN and DS as their witnesses. However, I did not give much weight to LSL’s testimony since there was evidence that he had a failing memory and could not remember much of what had happened in the past. DS gave evidence that after the incorporation of Richvein, he left it entirely to HN to manage Richvein and his evidence was, in any event, shaky and unreliable. The bulk of the evidence regarding the history between the parties came from JL and HN.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Disputes</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8       Over &amp; Over relied on three events which took place in the past six years and argued that these three events were oppressive and/or unfairly prejudicial to it. The three events were:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the transfer of Unicurrent’s 70% shareholding in Richvein to Bonvests in 2003 (“the Share Transfer”);</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the rights issue conducted by Richvein in October 2006, under which Richvein issued 66 million new shares to its shareholders at $0.38 per share (“the Rights Issue”); and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    three contracts entered into between Richvein and parties which were related to Bonvests and/or HN (“the Related Party Transactions”) comprising:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)     a contract dated 11 May 2006 with Colex Holdings Ltd for waste disposal services;</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)   a contract dated 28 July 2006 with Integrated Property Management Pte Ltd for cleaning services; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-list-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)  a hotel management contract dated 12 December 2005 with Henrick International Hotels &amp; Resorts Pte Ltd (subsequently renamed “The Residence Hotels &amp; Resorts Pte Ltd”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       It is therefore appropriate that I first set out the circumstances in relation to the three events in some detail.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Share Transfer</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     Article 30 of Richvein’s Articles of Association (“Richvein’s Articles”) initially restricted the transfer of shares to a non-member of the company as follows:</font><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 3]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Shares may be freely transferred by a member or other person entitled to transfer to any existing member selected by the transferor, but save as aforesaid, and save as provided by Article 35 hereof, no share shall be transferred to a person who is not a member so long as any member or any person selected by the Directors as one whom it is desirable in the interest of the Company to admit to membership is willing to purchase the same at fair value.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     The first mention of any transfer of shares in Richvein from Unicurrent to Bonvests was made on 29 May 2002 at the AGM of Richvein (the “2002 AGM”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12     The minutes of the 2002 AGM stated:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Transfer of Shares</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Chairman informed the shareholder’s representative of Over &amp; Over Limited, Mr Melvin Lee Tiong Choon, of Unicurrent Finance Limited’s (“Unicurrent”) intention, that at an opportune time Unicurrent will sell its entire holdings of 70,000,000 ordinary shares representing 70% of the issued capital of the Company to Bonvests Holdings Limited.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Mr Melvin Lee Tiong Choon, the representative of the other shareholder, Over &amp; Over Limited, expressed no objections to Unicurrent’s proposed sale of shares.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">RESOLVED that with no objections from Over &amp; Over Limited’s representative, Unicurrent Finance Limited would at an opportune time, sell its entire holdings of 70,000,000 ordinary shares representing 70% of the issued capital of the Company to Bonvests Holdings Limited.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     Over &amp; Over objected to the accuracy of the minutes as it claimed that no vote or approval of the proposed transfer (“the proposed Share Transfer”) was called during the 2002 AGM. After receiving the minutes of the 2002 AGM, Melvin Lee (who attended the 2002 AGM on Over &amp; Over’s behalf) wrote to Richvein’s company secretary on 27 June 2002 requesting for the resolution to be deleted</font><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 4]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14     After the 2002 AGM on 29 May 2002, discussions on the proposed Share Transfer continued between Over &amp; Over and Bonvests. There was a series of letters between HN and LSL.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15     Thereafter, on 27 June 2002, HN called LSL to discuss the proposed Share Transfer. Then, LSL was still considering whether or not to approve the proposed Share Transfer and he suggested selling Over &amp; Over’s shares in Richvein to Bonvests during the conversation. However, HN apparently said to LSL that it would not be justifiable for Over &amp; Over to do so as the proposed Share Transfer was at a discounted rate.</font><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 5]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16     On 8 August 2002, an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) was held to discuss the ‘proposed transfer of [Unicurrent’s] entire shareholdings in [Richvein] to [Bonvests]’</font><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 6]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. The minutes of the EGM showed that Over &amp; Over was interested in selling its 30% stake in Richvein together with Unicurrent to Bonvests. The EGM was adjourned to explore such a possibility. Over &amp; Over alleged that Bonvests had offered to buy Over &amp; Over’s stake in Richvein on or around 15 August 2002 on certain terms which entailed a cash payment</font><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 7]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. However, HN denied offering to pay in cash</font><a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 8]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     JL gave evidence that a meeting was held on 11 September 2002 between, <i>inter alia</i>, LSL and HN to discuss the proposed Share Transfer</font><a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 9]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. On the same day, Over &amp; Over rejected Bonvests’ offer</font><a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 10]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. Thereafter, in a letter dated 17 September 2002 from HN to Over &amp; Over’s solicitors, HN asked for a letter confirming that Over &amp; Over did not intend to sell its shareholding in Richvein to Bonvests, and that Over &amp; Over grant a waiver for Unicurrent to sell its shares to Bonvests. Over &amp; Over’s solicitors wrote back to HN on 18 September 2002 confirming that Over &amp; Over did not intend to sell its shareholdings in Richvein. However, Over &amp; Over’s solicitors were, at that time, waiting for their client’s instructions on the waiver.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     On 20 September 2002, HN wrote a letter to Over &amp; Over’s solicitors</font><a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 11]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2.       You also mentioned that you are still waiting for your client’s instructions on the waiver regarding the transfer of shares from Unicurrent Finance Limited to Bonvests Holdings Limited.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3.       As I had set out several times earlier the transfer of my 70% interest in the Company is an internal group restructuring. As I had mentioned before, it could be through Unicurrent transferring the 70% or through myself injecting Unicurrent into my Bonvests Group.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4.       To all intents and purposes, nothing will be changing in terms of my business relationship with your clients before and after the internal group restructuring for me as 70% shareholder and your clients as 30% shareholder.

In other words, there will be no pre-emptive rights for the transfer of shares in the Company.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If you are agreeable to the above suggested amendment, the waiver from our client would not be needed in respect to the transfer of shares in the Company from Unicurrent Finance Limited to Bonvests Holdings Limited.

Similarly, Bonvests and HN executed corporate and personal guarantees respectively for 70% of the loan granted by DBS Bank. The tenure of the 2002 Loan was for 5 years from the date of draw-down, or in any case up to 26 November 2007.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     In 2003, after the Share Transfer, HN successfully procured DBS Bank to release him as a personal guarantor.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     On 19 September 2006, HN procured from DBS Bank an offer of a revised financing package (the “Refinancing Package”) for Richvein for another five years. The Refinancing Package required a corporate and personal guarantee from Over &amp; Over and JL respectively for 30% of the loan. The Refinancing Package had an interest rate which was 0.65% lower than the 2002 Loan</font><a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 20]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. This would have saved Richvein about $162,500 a year in interest costs. The Refinancing Package offer was open for 7 days (i.e., up to 26 September 2006). In a letter dated 26 September 2006, Over &amp; Over and JL declined to extend their respective guarantees to the Refinancing Package.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     It appeared that after receiving Over &amp; Over’s letter dated 26 September 2006, Kwa Beng Seng (“KBS”), the financial controller for Richvein, spoke to a DBS Bank officer with regards to the requirement for corporate and personal guarantors for the 30% portion of the loan under the Refinancing Package. In a handwritten note addressed to HN that was written on the same letter from Over &amp; Over dated 26 September 2006, KBS stated</font><a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 21]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I also spoke to Teresa of DBS. She said that if the requirement of corporate &amp; personal guarantor is not met, the Bank has to re-consider the offer and the approval seeking process will need to be re-done. The pricing may or may not change.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     Lee Tiong Choon (also known as Melvin Lee) also gave evidence. He was the general manager of Gallant Investment Pte Ltd, another company owned by the Lauw family and would act on instructions from LSL and occasionally from JL. His evidence was that on or about 12 October 2006, he and two other persons met with Ms Loong Wai Leng, the vice-president of DBS Bank in charge of the loan to Richvein. Ms Loong had said that the guarantees in question were not mandatory but the absence thereof would result in a higher interest rate being charged. In any event, there was apparently no further development in respect of the Refinancing Package and it was not taken up.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     In the meantime, Richvein issued a notice dated 4 October 2006 to convene a board meeting (on 11 October 2006) for the purpose of convening an EGM to pass a proposed Rights Issue (the “Rights Issue EGM”). The notice to convene the board meeting did not provide any reason for the Rights Issue. The Rights Issue would raise about $25 million by issuing up to 66,000,000 new ordinary shares at S$0.38 per rights share</font><a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 22]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">(the “Rights Issue”).

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5.      In proposing a rights issue, management is entitled to believe that all shareholders will show continuous support and take up its rights. In my view, a pricing using audited net asset value (without valuation adjustment) per share of $0.3728 <i>(that will result in the maximum dilution of Over &amp; Over Limited’s share if it does not take up the rights) is not difficult to justify</i>.

Thereafter, the board meeting was held as planned on 11 October 2006. During the board meeting, both HN and Long Sie Fong (“LSF”) (the directors of Richvein who were nominated by Bonvests) voted in favour of convening the Rights Issue EGM, while JL voted against convening the Rights Issue EGM</font><a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 26]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28     I would add that even if JL were not aware of the purpose of the Rights Issue when he sent his letter dated 7 October 2006 to seek an adjournment of the board meeting, he was aware on 11 October 2006 because it was his own evidence that HN had stated at that board meeting that the purpose was to repay the 2002 Loan.</font></span></p>

In particular, JL raised the concern</font><a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 48]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">that:</font></span></p>

The way I see it, the whole arrangement looks like funds are being diverted from Richvein to the same group of companies to which Unicurrent Finance Ltd belongs.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">All this is, in my opinion, not in the long term interests of Richvein and is, in particular, prejudicial to the rights of the minority shareholders of Richvein.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     In HN’s reply to JL’s letter by a letter dated 29 July 1991, HN gave reasons as to why Richvein should contract with HIHR.

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">My actions in this matter have been wholly ethical and the development of a strategy to maintain the hotel’s existing market position and protect the combined interest of all parties is not at all self serving.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     In response to HN’s letter dated 29 July 1991, JL wrote two letters to Richvein.

JL took the view that the proposed management contract was ‘prejudicial’ and ‘unfairly discriminated’ against Richvein’s minority shareholder. JL then stated that if HN intended to proceed with the Management Contract, Over &amp; Over was prepared, in principle, to sell all their shares in Richvein</font><a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 51]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44     JL’s second letter dated 8 August 1991 was substantially similar to the first, except that it mentioned a meeting on 7 August 1991 during which it was suggested that Unicurrent buy over all Over &amp; Over’s shares in Richvein. However, HN did not agree to do so at the meeting. The second letter ended with JL asking HN to ‘seriously reconsider the matter so that an amicable solution can be attained’</font><a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 52]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45     Richvein responded to JL’s letter (dated 8 August 1991) on 2 September 1991, stating that it was not possible for Richvein to manage the hotel itself by employing the necessary people because it was necessary to provide compensation packages that included stock participation for at least two key employees whose participation in the management of the hotel was important</font><a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 53]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. It was intended that 25% of the shares in HIHR would be held by the two employees, with Bonvests holding the remaining 75% of HIHR’s shares. Richvein proposed that HIHR form a subsidiary, to be known as HS, to manage the hotel. Over &amp; Over was offered the chance to subscribe for some of the shares in HS, with HIHR to hold the remaining shares in HS. I need not set out the details supporting the proposed shareholding structure in HS.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46     In a fax dated 4 September 1991 to Richvein, Over &amp; Over rejected Richvein’s offer</font><a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 54]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">:</font></span></p>

The proportion of shares should not be diluted by the shareholding of Carl Kono and William Hau.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6.       Further, and notwithstanding (5) above, we would like to point out that although the Ngo family only owns 60% of the shares in Bonvests, they would have majority control of Bonvests and consequently have control over Henrick International and Henrick Singapore (since Bonvest will be holding the majority shares in Henrick International directly and indirectly in Henrick Singapore).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Further, Bonvests owns 75% in Henrick International and therefore can pass special resolutions in Henrick International. Over &amp; Over would also not be able to object to any special resolution in Henrick Singapore as Henrick International would have 85% of the shares and since Bonvests effectively controls Henrick International.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-AU"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">As such, the fact that Ngo family only owns 60% in Bonvests does not detract from the fact that the Ngo family will retain and have the ability to exercise full control over Henrick International and Henrick Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     Richvein, in its response dated 5 September 1991 to Over &amp; Over, stood by its letter dated 2 September 1991.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48     At the board meeting held on 23 September 2001, it was eventually resolved that Richvein (instead of HIHR, as initially suggested (at [45] above) would incorporate HS, which was to be 75% held by Richvein and 25% held by the two key employees, Carl Kono and William Hau. Richvein would enter into a management contract with HS for HS to manage the hotel and charge Richvein ‘a fee of 3% on revenue and 8% on adjusted gross operating profit’</font><a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 57]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.

Effectively, it was agreed that Richvein would contract with HS (in which the two key employees would have a stake), and in turn, HS would sub-contract with HIHR to provide such management services (“the three-tier arrangement”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49     About 11 years later, by 2002, HN was of the view that the reason for setting up HS (to provide equity incentive to certain employees) was no longer applicable since those employees had left. Therefore, on 26 March 2002, HN informed JL by letter that Richvein intended to terminate the management contract with HS and that Bonvests would provide administrative support to Richvein instead</font><a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 59]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.

In 2003, the issue was raised again. HN stated in a letter to JL dated 15 January 2003 that the reason for wanting to liquidate HS was that the original objective of setting it up (to allow for equity participation by certain employees) was no longer relevant since those employees had left</font><a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 62]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. Furthermore, there was approximately $10,000 savings from eliminating the need to incur compliance costs to maintain HS. HN suggested that the administrative support services could be taken over by HIHR directly. HN further suggested that HIHR would charge Richvein a flat fee of $100,000 a year</font><a href="#_ftn63" id="_ftnref63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 63]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">instead of charging HS based on the formula previously agreed upon (above at [48]).

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">50     However, by a board resolution of HS dated 8 December 2005 signed by HN and KBS, it was resolved to terminate the management agreement between Richvein and HS</font><a href="#_ftn65" id="_ftnref65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 65]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.

It is only when majority rule passes over into rule oppressive of the minority, or in disregard of their interests, that the section can be invoked. As was said in a decision upon the United Kingdom section there must be a <i>visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect</i> <em>before a case of oppression can be made (<strong>Elder v Elder &amp; watson Ltd</strong> 1952 SC 49</em>):</span> <span lang="EN-GB">their Lordships would place the emphasis on "visible". And <i>similarly "disregard" involves</i> something more than a failure to take account of the minority`s interest: there must be awareness of that interest and an evident decision to override it or brush it aside or to set at naught the proper company procedure (per Lord Clyde in <strong><em>Thompson Drysdale</em></strong> 1925 SC 311, 315). Neither "oppression" nor "disregard" need be shown by a use of the majoritys’ voting power to vote down the minority: either may be demonstrated by a course of conduct which in some identifiable respect, or at an identifiable point in time, can be held to have crossed the line.</span></font></p>

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">82 A clear exposition of the rationale underlying s 216 of the CA is found in the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in <i>O’Neill v Phillips</i> [1999] 1 WLR 1092, a case under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK), which corresponds materially to our s 216 CA. Lord Hoffmann said (at 1098–1099):</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In section 459 Parliament has chosen fairness as the criterion by which the court must decide whether it has jurisdiction to grant relief. It is clear from the legislative history ... that it chose this concept to free the court from technical considerations of legal right and to confer a wide power to do what appeared just and equitable. But this does not mean that the court can do whatever the individual judge happens to think fair. The concept of fairness must be applied judicially and the content which it is given by the courts must be based upon rational principles. …</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Although fairness is a notion which can be applied to all kinds of activities, its content will depend upon the context in which it is being used. Conduct which is perfectly fair between competing businessmen may not be fair between members of a family. In some sports it may require, at best, observance of the rules, in others (“it’s not cricket”) it may be unfair in some circumstances to take advantage of them. All is said to be fair in love and war. So the context and the background are very important.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In the case of section 459, the background has the following two features. First, a company is an association of persons for an economic purpose, usually entered into with legal advice and some degree of formality. The terms of the association are contained in the articles of association and sometimes in collateral agreements between the shareholders. Thus the manner in which the affairs of the company may be conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders have agreed. Secondly, company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity, like the Roman societas, as a contract of good faith. One of the traditional roles of equity, as a separate jurisdiction, was to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights in certain relationships in which it considered that this would be contrary to good faith. These principles have, with appropriate modification, been carried over into company law.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The first of these two features leads to the conclusion that a member of a company will not ordinarily be entitled to complain of unfairness unless there has been some breach of the terms on which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted. But the second leads to the conclusion that there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers. Thus unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">59     Although it was said in <i>Lim Swee Khiang</i> that s 459 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 (“UK Companies Act 1985”) corresponds materially to our s 216, it is useful to bear in mind that s 459(1) of the English legislation (as amended by the Companies Act Schedule 19, paragraph 11) is in terms different from our s 216. Section 459(1) states:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground that the company’s affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner <i>which is unfairly prejudicial</i> <i>to the</i> <i>interests of its members</i> generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself) or that any <i>actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is</i> <i>or would be so prejudicial</i>.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">60     As can be seen, the focus of s 459 is on “unfairly prejudicial” conduct. It does not have the four limbs in our s 216(1) (a) and (b). Thus, it is no wonder that Lord Hoffman stressed that the English Parliament had chosen fairness as the criterion by which a court must decide whether it has jurisdiction to grant relief.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">61     Although the Privy Council in <i>Re Kong Thai Sawmill</i> had explained what “oppression” and “disregard” each involves, it did not actually suggest that the four limbs in s 216(1) (a) and (b) are distinct.

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span lang="EN-GB">93 There appear to be three alternative bases for establishing liability under s 216 – oppression, disregard of a member’s interest and unfair discrimination or prejudice.

The Court of Appeal in <i>Low Peng Boon v Low Janie</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 761</nobr> adopted this stance by construing s 216 broadly and using “fair dealings” as the litmus test. The quintessential litmus test in s 216 is therefore as Lord Wilberforce aptly put it in the seminal case of <i>Re Kong Thai</i> <i>Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</i> <nobr>[1978] 2 MLJ 227</nobr> at 229, in relation to the Malaysian equivalent of our s 216:</span></font></p>

<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In our judgment, oppression occurs when shareholders, having a dominant power in a company, either (1) exercise that power to procure that something is done or not done in the conduct of the company’s affairs or (2) procure by an express or implicit threat of an exercise of that power that something is not done in the conduct of the company’s affairs; and when such conduct is <i>unfair</i> … to the other members of the company or some of them, and <i>lacks that degree of probity which they are entitled to expect in the conduct of the company’s affairs</i> ...

Rubin J had applied the Privy Council’s explanation of ‘oppression’ (which is only one of the limbs) as the ‘quintessential litmus test’ for s 216.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">65     In <i>Walter Woon on Company Law</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2005) (at [5.52]-[5.58]) (“<i>Woon on Company Law</i>”), there is an analysis of the four individual limbs of s 216 separately which provide some explanation for each individual limb. However, there is nothing in <i>Woon on Company Law</i> which suggests that the four individual limbs are distinctive. Further, the editors note at [5.62]:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… On the one hand, our s 216 is wider than s 459 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and s 232 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001. The marginal note was amended to reflect the width of the section. Judges can therefore take this cue to adopt a flexible approach and construe the provisions broadly. On the other hand, a liberal approach is liable to lead to uncertainty in the law and prolonged and expensive litigation which a small company can ill afford, although at the moment there seems to be no sign of a floodgate of litigation over s 216. The future development of s 216 will thus depend not only on conceptual arguments but also on how it has operated in practice. One thing is, however, clear. <i>The trend is to construe</i> the individual terms in the section broadly and not quibble over particular words. ‘[It] is now recognized that there should be no minute distinction between these individual terms, and that teh [<i>sic</i>] common thread underlying the entire section is the element of unfairness’ (<i>Ng Sing King v PSA International Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2005] SGHC 5</nobr>).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66     Margaret Chew, author of <i>Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</i> (Butterworths Asia, 2000) also takes the view that the general approach of unfairness is preferable (at p 119-120):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Upon either of the four grounds being established – ‘oppression’, ‘disregard of interests’, ‘unfair discrimination’ or ‘prejudice’ – the member may pursue a personal action under section 216 of the Companies Act for relief either against the company or those responsible for the ‘oppression’, ‘disregard of interests’, ‘unfair discrimination’ or ‘prejudice’ … section 216 covers the four grounds aforementioned distinctively and disjunctively.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">It is, however, submitted that any exercise in further defining or refining each of the expressions ‘oppression’, ‘disregard of interests’, ‘unfair discrimination’ or ‘prejudice’, in order to ascertain any differences in their meaning and application looks to be a frustrating one. It would be futile, if not impossible, to split pedantic hairs over the precise and exact meaning of the medley phraseology favoured by the legal draughtsman. The fruit of such labour could only add uncertainty and confusion.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">67     At p 121, the author continues:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The expressions in the Singapore, Malaysian, UK and Australian provisions – ‘oppression’, ‘disregard of interests’ (or ‘contrary to interests’), ‘unfair discrimination’ and ‘prejudice’ (or ‘unfair prejudice’) – all point toward behaviour on the part of the majority shareholders or the controllers of a company that departs from the standards of fair play amongst commercial man. Traditionally, such behaviour would have attracted the dyslogistic labels of unfair, improper, unjust or inequitable. Other unflattering labels have included the lukewarm tag of ‘reprehensible’ to the fiery rebuke of ‘tyrannical’. <i>It is such opprobrious behaviour, it is submitted, that the legal draughtsmen of section 216 of the Companies Act and its foreign equivalents, sought to impugn. Therefore, rather than distinguishing one ground from the other in section 216, the four grounds set out therein ought to be looked at as a compound one, the purpose of which is to identify conduct which offends the standards of commercial fairness and is deserving of intervention by the courts.</i> To this end, the combined language of section 216 is suggestive, descriptive and evocative.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Section 216 of the Companies Act was conceived and passed with the objective of protecting minority shareholders from majority abuse. In order to offer effective and comprehensive protection, section 216 confers on the courts a flexible jurisdiction to do justice and to address unfairness and inequity in corporate affairs… The discretionary power of the courts under section 216 is notoriously wide. <i>Thus, in determining the scope of section 216, rather than deciphering the precise nuance of each of the expressions ‘oppression’, disregard of interests’, ‘unfair discrimination’ and ‘prejudice’, a compendious interpretative approach, with an emphasis on the rationale and purpose of section 216, is hereby advocated.</i></font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">69     Before me, Over &amp; Over did not argue that there was any distinction between each limb.

Accordingly, I proceeded on the basis that Over &amp; Over needed to show that the three events it complained of were so unfair as to invoke s 216. Such a concept of fairness is to be applied judicially and its application by the courts must be based upon rational principles (<i>O’Neill v Phillips</i> [1991] 1 WLR 1092 at p 1098).

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">71     First, not every breach of the Company’s articles of association or shareholder’s agreement will invoke s 216. In <i>Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd and Ors</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 297</nobr> at p 310, the Court of Appeal held that breach of the company’s articles of association did not necessarily equate to oppressive conduct:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In so doing, technically there was a breach of the pre-emptive provisions of the articles of association of KPM, but <i>we do not think that such breach in the circumstances could be considered as oppressive conduct</i> on the part of Low or Zenecon or in any breach of any understanding reached with Kumagai.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[emphasis added]</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">72     In <i>Ng Sing King</i>, Rubin J held that the same was true in relation to a breach of a shareholder’s agreement. Furthermore, Bonvests argued that for relief to be granted under s 216, Over &amp; Over had to show ‘substantial prejudice and detriment’ as a result. In short, Bonvests argued that prejudice is an essential element under s 216. To support its contention, Bonvests cited <i>Ng Sing King</i>, where Rubin J said at [96]:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">It does not necessarily follow, however, that breach of any expectations enshrined in the Agreement is tantamount to oppressive conduct. Admittedly, breach of these terms would disappoint the shareholders’ expectations. Nonetheless, many other factors have to be considered to ascertain whether the breach resulted in unfairness, such as whether the breach was deliberate, whether it was a significant breach in disregard of a major expectation and whether any detriment was caused to the aggrieved shareholder. <i>Above all, the plaintiffs have the onus of showing that the breach prejudiced their interest in some way.</i> In this respect, Jonathan Parker J in <i>Re Blackwood Hodge plc</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 BCLC 650</nobr> underscored the importance of satisfying the court that harm has been caused by the breach.

<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[T]he petitioners must establish not merely that the [company] directors have been guilty of breaches of duty in the respects alleged, but also that those breaches caused the petitioners to suffer <i>unfair prejudice</i> in their capacity as preference shareholders.

<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The [relevant] conduct must be both prejudicial (in the sense of causing prejudice or harm to the relevant interest) and also unfairly so: conduct may be unfair without being prejudicial or prejudicial without being unfair, and it is not sufficient if the conduct satisfies only one of these tests ...</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">On the facts of this case, the court decided that the petitioners did not show that they had suffered any unfair prejudice by reason of the breaches of duty by the directors. <i>In the same vein, the presence or absence of loss is a significant factor to be taken into account in relation to the alleged breaches of the Agreement.</i></font></span></p>

Instead, Over &amp; Over used this opportunity to negotiate for the removal of the pre-emption rights in Richvein’s Articles which Bonvests agreed to and implemented.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">97     Over &amp; Over also relied on the haste in which the Rights Issue was implemented, including the refusal to grant an adjournment of the board meeting or the Rights Issue EGM or to provide more financial information. It also relied on the refusal to vary the mode of payment or extend time to pay.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">98     It submitted that the entire process, from the notice of the board meeting dated 4 October 2006 to the deadline to subscribe for the Rights Issue (by 3 November 2006) took only one month. The PALs were issued immediately after the Rights Issue EGM and parties were given eight days to subscribe. Over &amp; Over’s requests for an adjournment of the board meeting or the EGM were refused even though there was no urgency.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">99     Secondly, Richvein’s refusal to accept payment by telegraphic transfer was completely unreasonable as it would have made no difference whether payment was made by cheque or by telegraphic transfer. Over &amp; Over, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, did not have a bank account in Singapore from which a cheque could be issued. It did not even have the amount required ($7,524,000) in its bank account in Hong Kong at that time. It had to obtain funds from the Lauw family’s businesses in Indonesia and hence its request to pay by telegraphic transfer. Over &amp; Over had also requested for an extension of time to 9 November 2006 to pay for its allocation in view of the Lebaran public holiday in Indonesia and this request was rejected. Eventually, Over &amp; Over sent the funds to LSL’s Singapore bank account from which a cheque was issued and it paid for its allocation on 3 November 2006.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">100  Over &amp; Over also pointed out that Bonvests was prepared to borrow money (if necessary) at an interest rate higher than the 2002 Loan in order to subscribe for its portion of the Rights Issue. It submitted that this reinforced its submission that the Rights Issue was an attempt to dilute Over &amp; Over’s stake.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">101  I was of the view that it was important to bear in mind the background leading to the Rights Issue. The 2002 Loan was due for payment the next year, <i>ie</i>, November 2007. While HN accepted that there was no urgency to pay back the loan in 2006, another witness, Yeo Wee Kiong, who is a director of Bonvests, mentioned a reason for doing so in re-examination. He said</font><a href="#_ftn87" id="_ftnref87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 87]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I was in favour of the rights issue and subscribing for it, because of course I – we had a – I had a reason.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The reason was that the loan was – the loan of Richvein was maturing in 2007, and it was already coming to the end of 2006. So if we do not get the loan matter resolved by that time, in a matter of one, two months later, it will be the end of the year, and the loan in Richvein will become, instead of a long-term loan, it will become a short-term loan, a current loan, and that would make the financial statement of Richvein – putting it into a rather precarious position, because it would be – there would be more current liabilities than there are more current assets, and that’s not something that is prudent.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">So we supported a rights issue to make sure that a long-term asset like a hotel in Richvein was supported by long-term money. Long-term funds is in the form of the rights issue.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">102  As I mentioned, this evidence only surfaced during Mr Yeo’s re-examination, neither was it mentioned by HN at all as a reason for wanting to raise funds in 2006 to pay the 2002 Loan. It seemed to me to be a belated attempt to explain some urgency to repay when HN had accepted that there was no such urgency. In any event, it was not wrong for HN to look into the question of re-financing one year before the 2002 Loan was due for payment. Indeed, he was not faulted for doing that.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">103  HN had managed to get a re-financing package on better terms, <i>ie</i>, interest being charged at a rate lower than the 2002 Loan. Yet, Over &amp; Over and JL did not agree to provide their guarantees for 30% of the loan. In evidence from JL, it was clear that the real issue was his being required to provide his personal guarantee when HN did not have to provide a personal guarantee for 70% of the loan. Indeed, after the Share Transfer some years earlier, HN had managed to get himself released as a personal guarantor but JL did not succeed then (see [22]). This state of affairs irked JL to the extent that he was not prepared to give his personal guarantee for the re-financing package.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">104  Ironically, I found that it was JL who was behaving unreasonably. DBS Bank had released HN and Unicurrent from their respective guarantees because Bonvests, a public listed company, had given its guarantee (for 70% of the 2002 Loan). JL was therefore not in a similar position as HN since Over &amp; Over was a HK$2 company with its shares in Richvein being its only asset. Yet, JL was adamant about not continuing to provide his personal guarantee. It appeared not to matter to him what disadvantages this would entail. The evidence at trial was that DBS Bank might still have extended a loan but on less favourable terms to Richvein.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">105  True, HN could have used some of the cash of Richvein and/or its revenue to repay part of the 2002 Loan but, in any event, a loan of some amount, whether $6 million or more, would still be required. True, HN could have gone to other banks or financial institutions and would probably have got a loan but on what terms? Also, he was faced with an unreasonable shareholder who had already refused to accept a re-financing package which appeared to him (HN) to be reasonable. Furthermore, JL also did not pursue re-financing with any bank except for a query made by his staff on or about 12 October 2006 with DBS Bank, see [25] above.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">106  I noted that JL was unable to explain satisfactorily why he considered the Rights Issue to be an unreasonable option, in principle. He kept on insisting that Richvein should have tried to obtain a loan first and thought it would only be right to have the Rights Issue if a loan were not available. Yet, he was the one who torpedoed the DBS re-financing package. The only reason why he insisted on a loan as the obvious priority was because ‘every company borrows money’.</font><a href="#_ftn88" id="_ftnref88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 88]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">Yet, that in turn would have entailed interest costs.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">107  In any event, the crux of the matter was not whether there were other means of raising some or all the money to pay the 2002 Loan but whether the Rights Issue in the circumstances was unfair. The availability of other means of repayment in itself did not make the Rights Issue unfair.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">108  As mentioned, HN did not come up with the idea of the Rights Issue at the outset. The Rights Issue was called because of JL’s intransigence. I could well understand HN’s frustration. That is why HN’s responses in cross-examination, which Over &amp; Over relied on, must be considered in context. It also seemed to me that such responses were also given out of pique.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">109  While the 2002 Loan need not be repaid immediately in October 2006, it was a matter which HN wanted dealt with after having been thwarted by JL.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">110  I was of the view that HN’s responses, which Over &amp; Over relied on, did not suggest that HN was hoping to dilute Over &amp; Over’s interest with the Rights Issue. There is a difference between being frustrated with JL/Over &amp; Over and trying to fix them in the manner suggested.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">111  As for KBS’ memorandum (see [26] again), it suggested that HN did consider the possibility that Over &amp; Over might refuse to subscribe for its portion of a rights issue. KBS’ memorandum addressed the maximum dilution depending on the pricing but that is different from saying that HN was aiming for a dilution. While the price of $0.38 per rights share might result in maximum dilution, there was no suggestion by Over &amp; Over that the price itself was unjustifiable. Presumably, Bonvests itself would also want to pay the minimum price justifiable.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">112  The refusal to grant an adjournment of the board meeting or the Rights Issue EGM or to furnish more information to JL must also be considered together with JL’s requests. Did JL really require more time or information? Over &amp; Over had been receiving the audited accounts of Richvein every year and monthly management accounts. In fact, JL was not able to elaborate more specifically during cross-examination what kind of additional information he was seeking.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">113  As for the alleged haste in which the entire exercise was completed, I did not think that one month or eight days was unduly short given the fact that Over &amp; Over had been given adequate notice of the Rights Issue EGM.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">114  As for the mode of payment being by cheque, HN said he had left such details to be determined by the company secretary. Even if this were true, it is also true that he could have given instructions to accept payment by, say, telegraphic transfer or to extend time for subscription when the respective requests were made. However, the background circumstances had been frustrating to him. To use his words, ‘I thought Over &amp; Over tried to be funny with me’.</font><a href="#_ftn89" id="_ftnref89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 89]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">115  As far as HN was concerned, he did not want to be bothered any more with requests from JL. As regards the point that Over &amp; Over did not have a bank account in Singapore, the fact was that eventually Over &amp; Over subscribed for its portion of the Rights Issue on time using LSL’s personal cheque drawn on a bank account in Singapore.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">116  Insofar as Over &amp; Over was saying that it did not have available funds in Singapore to subscribe, it had known for some time before the EGM that HN was pushing ahead with the Rights Issue.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">117  Besides, Bonvests also did not have ready cash to subscribe for its portion of the Rights Issue. That was why it was considering taking a loan to do so. It seemed to me that the fact that it was prepared to borrow money at a higher rate of interest than the 2002 Loan was not so much an indication of its intention to dilute Over &amp; Over’s stake but of HN’s frustration with JL. In any event, the subsequent repayments of part of shareholders’ loans would have alleviated any temporary need to borrow.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">118  There was no prejudice to Over &amp; Over. In all the circumstances, I did not think that HN and Bonvests had acted unfairly in respect of the Rights Issue.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">119  Over &amp; Over did not dispute that the 1984, 1991 and the 1992 Notices (see [35] to [37] above) had been given. Over &amp; Over’s complaint was that: (1) there was no subsequent disclosure to the board of Richvein in respect of any change in HN’s interest in those companies; and (2) there was no specific disclosure to the board of Richvein of Bonvests’ and/or HN’s interests in the transactions before Richvein assented to those contracts</font><a href="#_ftn90" id="_ftnref90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 90]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. Further, Over &amp; Over questioned whether there was commercial justification for entering into the contract with HIHR. In particular, while Over &amp; Over accepted that there was ostensible commercial justification for the Colex Contract and the IPM Contract, it doubted whether the price of all the disputed contracts were reasonable and in the best interests of the company.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">120  Under s 156(4) of the Companies Act, a general notice is sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any transaction if, <i>inter alia</i>, the director’s interest is not ‘different in nature or greater in extent than the nature and extent so specified in the general notice at the time the transaction was made’. Over &amp; Over did not give any evidence to show how HN was in breach of s 156(4) by virtue of his interest in the related companies being <i>different in nature</i> or <i>greater in extent</i> from the time of the latest applicable notice to the time the transactions were entered into. However, s 156(9) provides that s 156 is in addition to and not in derogation of any rule of law or any provision in the articles restricting a director from having any interest in transactions with the company.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">122  Article 92 required HN to disclose the nature of his interest in any transaction which is determined at a director’s meeting of Richvein, or <i>in any other case</i>, at the first director’s meeting after his interest is acquired. Arguably, Article 92 still required HN to disclose his interest in <i>every</i> contract or arrangement whether the contract was discussed and determined at a board meeting or not. However, mere non-compliance of Article 92 would not necessarily warrant a finding of unfairness, see [71] above.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">123  As regards Over &amp; Over’s argument that Bonvests bore the burden of proving that the pricing under each of the Related Party Transactions was reasonable and in Richvein’s best interests, Over &amp; Over did not plead that the pricing, or any other term, was disadvantageous to Richvein</font><a href="#_ftn92" id="_ftnref92" name="_ftnref92" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 92]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. Indeed, JL confirmed during cross-examination that he was not raising any complaint about the terms of the Related Party Transactions</font><a href="#_ftn93" id="_ftnref93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 93]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. He was complaining about non-disclosure per se. In such circumstances, it was not open to Over &amp; Over to argue that it was for Bonvests to establish that the contracts were in fact reasonable and in the best interests of Richvein. Likewise, it was not pleaded or alleged in evidence that there was no commercial justification for the contract with HIHR.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">124  JL gave evidence that he had seen the 1984, 1991 and 1992 Notices under which HN disclosed his interests in Colex, IPM and HIHR. This would suggest that JL knew or ought to have known of HN’s interests in the three companies.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">125  When Mr  Yeo proceeded to ask JL whether he had known that Richvein had contracted with each of the three companies, JL initially agreed that he had been aware that both Colex and IPM had contracted with Richvein several years before May 2007.</font><a href="#_ftn94" id="_ftnref94" name="_ftnref94" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 94]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">However, JL then changed his evidence and said that he had not been aware of the contracts which Colex and IPM each had had with Richvein.</font><a href="#_ftn95" id="_ftnref95" name="_ftnref95" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 95]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. I was of the view that JL had known at least that Richvein had been contracting with businesses related to HN or Bonvests.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">126  My view is reinforced by the fact that Richvein’s audited accounts for the years 2003 to 2006 have a paragraph on “Related Party Information”, which listed significant transactions with related parties (although the specific names were not disclosed). Under the expenses section of the “Related Party Information”, there was an item for “Cleaning service fees to fellow subsidiaries”, which indicated a payment by Richvein for such services. The amounts were $433,632 for the year ending 2003</font><a href="#_ftn96" id="_ftnref96" name="_ftnref96" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 96]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">, $469,686 for the year ending 2004</font><a href="#_ftn97" id="_ftnref97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 97]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">, $474,440 for the year ending 2005</font><a href="#_ftn98" id="_ftnref98" name="_ftnref98" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 98]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="+0">and $472,254 for the year ending 2006</font><a href="#_ftn99" id="_ftnref99" name="_ftnref99" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 99]</font></span></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">. In my view, JL would have realised from these accounts that there were contracts between Richvein for cleaning services with ‘fellow subsidiaries’ related to HN or Bonvests as JL’s family businesses were not the related parties involved. Yet, Over &amp; Over did not bother to make any inquiry until 17 April 2007 which was after Over &amp; Over’s solicitors had written in March 2007 to allege that it had been oppressed or unfairly prejudiced.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">127  The cleaning fees reflected in Richvein’s audited accounts related to contracts which Richvein had had with Colex and IPM. JL accepted this in cross-examination. The 2006 contracts with Colex and with IPM were renewal contracts with no additional disadvantageous term to Richvein.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">128  Likewise, the same audited accounts disclosed generally that management fees were being paid to fellow subsidiaries. Again, there was no query then by JL. The fees were those paid by Richvein to HS who in turn made some payments to HIHR. In 2006, the fees would have been paid by Richvein direct to HIHR.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">129  Moreover, it did not lie in Over &amp; Over’s mouth to complain that HIHR had no employee or that a large proportion of the management fee paid by Richvein to HIHR would subsequently be re-directed to Bonvests. Under the three-tier arrangement which I elaborated on at [48], and which Over &amp; Over had agreed to, HIHR was already receiving payment for services rendered although, at that time, the payment was routed through HS. HS had become redundant, for the reasons I have set out. Removing HS saved compliance costs. HIHR was not receiving more from Richvein than what it had received from HS. Indeed, HIHR was being paid a flat fee of $100,000 whereas under the three-tier arrangement, HS could have received 2% to 5% of HN’s gross income if that was higher than $100,000 (see [48] again).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">130  The complaint about Richvein’s contract with HIHIR was therefore devoid of merit.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">131  For the above reasons, I rejected Over &amp; Over’s allegation of unfairness in respect of the three Related Party Transactions.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">132  I would add that even taking all three events (the Share Transfer, the Rights Issue and the Related Party Transactions) into account cumulatively did not lead to a conclusion of any unfairness for the purpose of s 216. I agreed with Bonvests’ submissions that this action was Over &amp; Over’s attempt to compel Bonvests to buy its shares in Richvein, which was a going concern making profits over the last few years.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">133  In the circumstances, I dismissed Over &amp; Over’s claims and ordered Over &amp; Over to pay Bonvests the costs of this action to be agreed or taxed, excluding the costs and disbursements of Bonvests’ expert witnesses who were not called. I elaborate that I did not allow Bonvests the fees and disbursements of its expert witnesses because it was unnecessary to involve such witnesses in the first place. I accept that the omission to call a witness to the stand does not always mean that the fees and disbursements of that witness will necessarily be excluded.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">134  I also ordered Over &amp; Over to pay Richvein’s costs fixed at $7,000 as the substantive dispute was between Over &amp; Over and Bonvests, not with Richvein.</font></span></p>
