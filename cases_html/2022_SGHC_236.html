</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In CC 37/2019, the accused challenged the voluntariness of six statements adduced by the Prosecution. These included the 31 March and 4 April Statements. The six statements were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) two contemporaneous statements, one recorded on 24 March 2016 at about 1.20pm in the CNB operational vehicle and another at about 3.32pm in the bedroom of the Unit;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) a cautioned statement recorded on 25 March 2016 at about 3.08am under s 23 of the CPC (“25 March Statement”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a long statement recorded on 30 March 2016 at about 2.59pm under s 22 of the CPC (“30 March Statement”); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the 31 March and 4 April Statements. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The accused’s version of events is recounted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz and another </span>[2019] SGHC 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Ansari (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 1)</span>”) at [6]–[7]. In brief, the accused alleged that, on 24 March 2016 in the CNB operational vehicle, he had begged Staff Sergeant Muhammad Helmi bin Abdul Jalal (“SSGT Helmi”) to “let Bella go because she’s not involved in the case”. SSGT Helmi responded, “It depends on what you say”. This induced him to make the two contemporaneous statements referred to at [14(a)] above. Further, on 25 March 2016, at about 3.00am, he was taken to an interview room at the Police Cantonment Complex Lock-up and was alone with SI Fathli in the room for a brief moment. The accused testified that he had begged SI Fathli “to let Bella go, Bella my girlfriend, because she’s not involved in this”. The accused alleged that SI Fathli then said “[s]o far you have been [cooperative]. So if you continue cooperating, we will let Bella go” (“SI Fathli’s Inducement”). This induced the accused to make the rest of the statements at [14(b)]–[14(d)] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 After an ancillary hearing, Chan J found that the Prosecution had not met its burden of proof for the statements at [14(a)]–[14(c)] above. Chan J was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the inducements had not been made and, if so made, had not operated on the accused’s mind. In respect of the 31 March and 4 April Statements, on the other hand, Chan J held that these were voluntarily made: <span class="font-italic">Ansari (No 1)</span> at [39] and [61]. In contrast to the earlier statements where he maintained Bella was not involved, the accused had incriminated Bella in these two statements. He further admitted that he had given the information which incriminated Bella in his bid to obtain a Certificate of Substantive Assistance (“CSA”). Chan J held that his motive of self-preservation had, by this time, overcome his motive to protect Bella, and SI Fathli’s Inducement, made six and ten days prior, had dissipated: <span class="font-italic">Ansari (No 1)</span> at [59].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In this trial, the Prosecution did not seek to re-open the issue of whether an inducement occurred nor to admit the four statements that Chan J had ruled to be involuntary. They sought to adduce the 31 March and 4 April Statements which Chan J had admitted in the earlier proceedings. The accused, on the other hand, challenged once again the admissibility of both these statements. He also challenged the 9 December Statement which was not considered in <span class="font-italic">Ansari (No 1)</span>. The Prosecution initially adopted the position that the accused was not able to re-open the already-determined issue of whether SI Fathli’s Inducement had dissipated when the Challenged Statements were made, but subsequently decided that the accused should not be precluded from challenging admissibility by raising new evidence in the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In considering the new evidence, I took into account <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 2 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo</span>”), where the Court of Appeal held that the court had the inherent power to prevent the use of its procedure which would be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people: <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo </span>at [82(a)]. The administration of justice could potentially be brought into disrepute where manifest inconsistency arises between the court’s findings in two separate sets of proceedings. However, whether this amounts to an abuse of process remains a fact-sensitive inquiry: <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo </span>at [82(f)], [82(g)] and [83]. The Court of Appeal observed that the existence of the risk of manifest inconsistency between earlier and pending proceedings “may not, in and of itself, amount to an abuse of process”, and that the ultimate consideration remained whether it was “unfair and unjust to the accused person or otherwise inconsistent with the fair administration of justice to permit the pending or intended proceedings to continue”: <span class="font-italic">Beh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chew Boo </span>at [84].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In the present case, while the voluntariness of the 31 March and 4 April Statements was the very issue Chan J had ruled on in <span class="font-italic">Ansari (No 1</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>, the issue I considered was whether the new evidence adduced by the accused raised a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the Challenged Statements. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The burden remained on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Challenged Statements were made voluntarily: </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chai </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chai </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chien Wei Kelvin</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [53]. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 31 March and 4 April Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The accused sought to show that, despite his incrimination of Bella, SI Fathli’s inducement was still operating on his mind.

Based on this vein of the accused’s evidence, he was therefore being forthright about Bella’s involvement with the Drugs in the hope that the CNB would release Bella <span class="font-italic">in spite </span><span class="font-italic">of</span> her being incriminated, having honoured his end of the <span class="font-italic">quid pro </span><span class="font-italic">quo</span>. While this explanation, taken alone, could at least have been a plausible account for why the accused believed the incriminatory statements served an ultimately exculpatory end, it represented a contradiction of his earlier evidence that he had lied and inculpated Bella to a limited degree in order to <span class="font-italic">hide</span> her true (and larger) involvement. This contradiction cast doubt on the accused’s account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25   Strand 2 of the accused’s evidence was also not believable. As pointed out by the Prosecution, it was unlikely that the accused would commit such an error or exhibit such a lack of care if SI Fathli’s Inducement was truly operative on his mind. Even if it were accepted that the use of the word “Narkoba” was a slip of the tongue, it was curious that he did not retract his statement at that point nor amend it when invited to do so on subsequent occasions.

</div> Instead, he even went on to explain what the term “Narkoba” meant in Indonesian. Put in the context of the accused’s previous inculpatory statements about Bella merely helping to <span class="font-italic">pack</span> the drugs, this presented a further implication of Bella in so far as it suggested that Bella had <span class="font-italic">knowledge </span>of what the drugs were.

</div> To this, it may be relevant to consider that the accused had <span class="font-italic">previously</span> changed his position with SI Fathli: his initial representation was that Bella was not involved “in any of this” (referring both to the drugs in the car and the Unit), but this had changed by the time the 31 March Statement was given. This risk of being disbelieved did not stop the accused from changing his position when giving the 31 March Statement. When this is considered together with the accused’s evidence that he gave the 31 March Statement in hope of receiving a CSA, the more convincing inference was that the accused did not amend this answer as he had voluntarily given it, driven by self-preservation. The accused’s other answer in cross-examination as to why he did not amend this answer, that he “[did not] see the need to” do so, must also be viewed in this light.

It must also be remembered that six and ten days respectively had passed from the time of SI Fathli’s Inducement to the making of the 31 March and 4 April Statements.

The accused’s evidence was that there were no additional inducements made after SI Fathli’s Inducement on 25 March 2016. Following from my finding that any inducement made had dissipated by the 31 March Statement, no inducement could have been in play on 9 December 2016. By this time, more than eight months had passed since SI Fathli’s Inducement was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The circumstances of the 9 December Statement reinforce this finding. Prior to giving the 9 December Statement, the accused was informed that both he and Bella faced a joint charge for trafficking the Drugs. Bella’s circumstances could not have been bleaker since she was now also facing a capital charge. There was absolutely no reason for the accused to persist in any belief that SI Fathli would follow through with the promise that the police would “let Bella go”.

First, the arrest of the accused and the events in the chain of custody occurred in March 2016. The trial was conducted between January and May 2022, some six years later. This was a considerable amount of time. Yong Pung How CJ held in <span class="font-italic">Md </span><span class="font-italic">Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[2004] SGHC 233 at [20] that some minor inconsistencies in the evidence of two witnesses was likely where there was a lapse of time between the incident and the hearing. As per the oft-cited passage from <span class="font-italic">Chean</span><span class="font-italic"> Siong Guat v Public Prosecutor </span>[1969] 2 MLJ 63: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Affandi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>made clear at [41] and [56] that speculative arguments about the possibility of a break in the chain of custody will not be entertained. What must be raised is a reasonable doubt that there was such a break in the chain. A fanciful notion of a theoretical possibility will not suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I also considered the specific issues raised at [38] by the accused:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) These inconsistencies at [38(a)] concerned minor details. While SSGT Helmi could not remember which officer passed him the duffel bag before he recorded the contemporaneous statement, SI Wong testified that it was him who passed it to SSGT Helmi.

</div>
</div> As for who SSGT Helmi passed the Drugs to after he recorded the statement, there were admittedly inconsistencies in the evidence. SI Eng and SI Wong mirrored each other in their statements in saying that the duffel bag was passed to SI Wong first who then passed it to SI Eng. SSGT Helmi omitted the intervening detail of SI Wong, and SI Eng omitted this intervening detail in his testimony in court as well.

</div> The inconsistency did not detract from the key aspects of the chain of custody: SSGT Helmi held the duffel bag while recording the statement; the duffel bag remained in the Unit, attended to at all times; and the duffel bag was passed to SI Eng before he left the Unit with it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) SI Wong’s recollection of the colour at [38(b)] was also a minor inconsistency. This was not a case where there were multiple duffel bags of different colours in the Unit. Instead, the evidence was clear that there was only one duffel bag in the Unit, and that duffel bag was in the custody of SI Eng who handed over the exhibits within to SI Fathli at CNB Headquarters.

For the heroin at home, I had asked her to help me pack the heroin into the small ziplock bags. I think she had only packed less than 15 packets of heroin. The rest, I did it on my own.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Question 7: Can you elaborate on what you mean by “the rest” in you earlier answer?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Answer 7: Firstly, after getting a fresh heroin shipment, I would open up the plastic packet. I would then pour it into a small container. I then opened up the small ziplock bags and use a metal spoon to pour the heroin into them. After that, I weigh each heroin packet to make sure they weigh about 7.6 grams. From 1 batu of heroin, I can make about 60 of these small heroin packets. I would then put 5 of these small heroin packets into a slightly bigger ziplock bag. Because of the poor quality of the ziplock bags, I had to double the layer. After that, I would use a black wire tape to seal the whole packet.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Question 8: Does Bella know what the thing she was packing is?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Answer 8: She calls it “Narkoba”. It means heroin in Indonesian language. However, she does not smoke it. She did try to advise me to go back to a normal life. The reason why she offered to help me pack was because she saw that I did not have enough rest due to the packing and selling of the heroin. Sometimes, I would not sleep the whole night to repack the heroin.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Question 9: How long has Bella been helping you pack the heroin?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Answer 9: I think it is around 2 weeks. However, it was not often. It was once in a while. She did not help me out for every shipment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Thus, the only conclusion that could be drawn from the accused’s statements was that he was in possession of all the Drugs.

</div> As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1087 at [62], there could be a variety of reasons for the absence of a subject’s DNA from an exhibit, including degradation of the DNA samples by intentional or unintentional means. The absence of DNA is therefore neither conclusive nor necessarily probative. Nevertheless, the presence of DNA is generally probative because it suggests that the subject did in fact come into contact with the surface on which his DNA was found. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Thus, all that this aspect of the DNA evidence established was that Bella touched the exhibits on which her DNA was found. This did not assist the accused, because it was also consistent with the Prosecution’s case and Bella’s evidence that she had helped to pack the drugs which belonged to the accused.

For example, there would be no reason for her DNA to be found on the sticky tape which was used to wrap all the packed drugs found in the bag from Location A because she had testified that all she did was take brown substances from a container and put them into small plastic bags.

</div> In response, the Prosecution referred to the evidence of Ms Wong. She gave evidence that DNA could transfer from one object to another when the two objects in question came into mutual contact. She also testified that certain things picked up and retained DNA more easily than others, such as the sticky side of tape.

</div> In the face of this evidence, the defence’s submission lost its force. Given that the exhibits were packed closely together, it was possible that Bella’s DNA transferred from surfaces which she did in fact touch to surfaces which she did not. This was especially the case for the sticky side of the tape used to pack the Drugs. In any case, even if Bella was more involved in packing the Drugs than she let on, this did not necessarily raise reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s possession of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defence also sought to cast doubt on the veracity and credibility of Bella’s testimony by highlighting that she was prepared to lie to save herself. However, by the time of trial, Bella had already been charged, convicted and sentenced to 26 years’ imprisonment.

</div> For the drugs at Location A and exhibit B1A1A1, his defence was that they belonged to Bella. As explained at [78] above, I did not accept this defence. No defence was raised to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the MDA in relation to the 16.51g of diamorphine in the exhibits found at Location A and in exhibit B1A1A1.
