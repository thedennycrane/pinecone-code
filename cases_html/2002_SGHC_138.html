<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">Introduction</font></b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">1.    One Myoe Aung and seven other persons were the

Interveners in Admiralty in Rem No 600360 of 2001. They were the crew of ‘AQUARIUS

III’ (‘the Vessel’) which had been arrested in Singapore on the application

of the Plaintiff Gulf Agency (Singapore) Pte Ltd (‘Gulf Agency’).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">2.    Gulf Agency was the Vessel’s agent. After the

Vessel arrived in Singapore on 9 May 2001, Gulf Agency supplied food, provisions, bunkers

and water and was responsible for the port dues. In the meantime, crew’s wages were

not paid for several months. The owners had apparently abandoned the Vessel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.    Although the crew’s wages ranked higher in

priority to the claim of Gulf Agency, it was Gulf Agency who arrested the Vessel on 21

September 2001.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">4.    Gulf Agency then obtained an Order of Court dated 2

November 2001 for the Vessel to be appraised and sold pendente lite. The Order was

suspended for ten days to allow the owners an opportunity to satisfy all claims against

the Vessel. However, Gulf Agency did not proceed to sell the Vessel upon expiration of the

ten day period. The Interveners’ solicitors Gurbani &amp; Co then requested Gulf

Agency'’ solicitors to file the Commission for Appraisement and Sale of the Vessel.

They said that if this was not done by 15 November 2001, the Interveners would file the

same and ask the court for costs of taking over the sale process. Apparently there was no

response.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.    On 27 November 2001, Gurbani &amp; Co wrote again

to Colin Ng &amp; Partners on the same subject but on an urgent basis. They also asked for

a copy of the Order of Court dated 2 November 2001. On 29 November 2001, they wrote a

third time and asked for the Order of Court dated 2 November 2001 to be served on them.

This time, Colin Ng &amp; Partners replied to say that the Interveners might take whatever

action they deemed fit but would first have to apply to intervene in the action as they

were not yet formally on record as Interveners.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.    The Interveners then applied for and obtained an

Order of Court dated 5 December 2001 to allow them to intervene in the action and to have

conduct of the sale of the Vessel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.    Thereafter, the Sheriff took steps to advertise the

Vessel for sale. The advertisement was to appear in the Straits Times on 4 January 2002.

However Gurbani &amp; Co requested the Sheriff to abort this advertisement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.    Colin Ng &amp; Partners were not aware of this

development. In mid-January 2002, they made enquiries with the Sheriff’s office. They

say that it was then that they discovered that the advertisement had not taken place

because the Interveners had received part payment of their wages from the owners.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.    On 21 January 2002, Colin Ng &amp; Partners sent a

fax to the owners’ solicitors, copied to Gurbani &amp; Co, giving the owners a final

opportunity to satisfy all claims by 28 January 2002 or the advertisement would proceed.

Gurbani &amp; Co sent a similar fax on 21 January 2002 to the owners’ solicitors

although they had received a second part payment by then.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.    As the owners failed to pay, Gurbani &amp; Co then

wrote on 28 January 2002 to the Sheriff to proceed with the advertisement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.    However, on 29 January 2002, they once again

requested the Sheriff to postpone the advertisement so as to give the owners a final

opportunity to settle all claims by 8 February 2002. This was because the owners’

solicitors had made a written request for a final extension of time to 8 February 2002 to

settle all outstandings.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">12.    On 30 January 2002, Colin Ng &amp; Partners wrote

to the Sheriff. Their fax stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘We refer to M/s Gurbani &amp; Co’s fax of 29

  January 2002 and your fax of 30 January 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify">We were not informed of M/s Gurbani’s intention to delay the sale,

  and we do not agree to the same.</p>
<p align="justify">However, as your good office has exercised the discretion to delay the

  sale by a week, we respect the same and will abide by it.</p>
<p align="justify">Our clients however, reserve their rights to seek reimbursement payment

  of Sheriff’s expenses from M/s Gurbani’s clients for the one week from 1

  February 2002 to 8 February 2002.’</p>
<font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.    Although Colin Ng &amp; Partners took the

position that they were not informed of the request by Gurbani &amp; Co, the request was

in fact copied to them. What they meant was that they were not given prior notice of the

request.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.    On 30 January 2002, the Sheriff wrote to Gurbani

&amp; Co to state that the postponement, until 8 February 2002, would be final and the

Sheriff would not entertain such requests in future. On the same day, Gurbani &amp; Co

replied to agree that no more postponements should be granted thereafter. They also said

that if the Sheriff did not hear from them by noon of 11 February 2002, the Sheriff was to

proceed with the advertisement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.    On 18 February 2002, Gurbani &amp; Co followed up

by writing to the Sheriff to proceed with the advertisement whereupon the advertisement

was eventually effected on 1 March 2002. The advertisement requested bids for the purchase

of the Vessel to reach the Sheriff by 15 March 2002. However, no bids were received.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.    On 20 March 2002, the Sheriff wrote to Gurbani

&amp; Co requesting for another $3,000 to re-advertise the Vessel. The Sheriff received no

response. On 27 March 2002, Colin Ng &amp; Partners wrote to Gurbani &amp; Co to put up

the advertisement fees. There was no response.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.    In April 2002, Gulf Agency managed to get a buyer

through its own efforts and applied to court to sanction the sale. However the buyer

failed to complete the sale.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.    On 2 May 2002, Colin Ng &amp; Partners requested

the Sheriff to re-advertise the Vessel for sale since the Interveners did not put up any

fresh funds for further advertisements. Gulf Agency also arranged for an advertisement in

Lloyd’s List. However, there was no bid except for an offer of $140,000. Gulf Agency

then applied for and obtained a Court order to sanction this sale.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.    The price of $140,000 was insufficient to pay port

dues and guard charges which ranked in priority to crew’s wages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.    Hence, the Interveners applied by Notice of Motion

for an order that the wages and disbursements of the crew from the date of arrest till the

date of repatriation be treated as Sheriff’s expenses and to rank in priority to all

other claims.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.    The Interveners’ application also covered the

costs of repatriation of the crew and the Interveners’ deposit of $3,000 in respect

of an appraisement of the Vessel, and advertisement to sell the Vessel. However, Gulf

Agency had taken steps to pay for the repatriation of the crew and did not contest that

the $3,000 deposit should be treated as Sheriff’s expenses. Hence, these became

non-issues.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">22.    It was obvious that although the crew’s wages

ranked in priority to that of Gulf Agency’s claim, the Interveners would not receive

anything from the sale proceeds as such proceeds were not sufficient even to pay port dues

and guard charges which in turn ranked in priority as Sheriff’s expenses to the

crew’s wages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">23.    If, however, the crew’s wages were to be

treated as Sheriff’s expenses, then they would be paid either from the sale proceeds

or by Gulf Agency under the usual indemnity (from Gulf Agency) to the Sheriff to pay for

the Sheriff’s expenses. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3"><i><b>Arguments for the Interveners</b></i></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">24.    The Interveners’ application was confined to

the crew’s wages and disbursements from the date of the arrest of the Vessel and did

not include wages and disbursements prior to arrest.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.    Mr Alvin Looi, Counsel for the Interveners,

submitted that the equities were such that the post-arrest wages and disbursements should

be part of the Sheriff’s expenses because the Sheriff was obliged to preserve and

maintain the Vessel from the date of arrest. To do so, the Sheriff was required by law to

maintain a minimum number of crew on board the Vessel during the period of arrest.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">26.    He referred to Regulation 9 of the Maritime and

Port Authority of Singapore (Port) Regulations which states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<b>Adequate crew on board</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">9.(1) </font>  <font size="3">The owner,

  agent, master or person-in-charge of a vessel shall at all times ensure that the vessel is

  sufficiently and efficiently manned.</font></p>
<p align="justify">(2)    The owner, agent, master or person-in-charge of a

  vessel at anchor shall at all times have on board the vessel a sufficient number of men -</p>
<p align="justify">            (a)

  capable of veering cable and keeping anchor lights burning; and</p>
<p align="justify">            (b)

  for taking appropriate action in case of an emergency.</p>
<p align="justify">(3)     The Port Master may, in respect of any

  vessel or class of vessels, from time to time stipulate the number of men required under

  paragraph (2).</p>
<p align="justify">(4) ….’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.    The Port Marine Circular No 38 of 1998 dated 3

August 1998 states:</font><font size="4">
<ol>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">‘<b>VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN PORT</b></p>

  onboard sufficient number of men capable of veering cable, keeping anchor lights lit and

  taking appropriate action in case of an emergency.</p>
<p align="justify">2 Vessels under active employment/repair must have their full

  operational crew onboard. In other cases, at least half the number of Officers, Engineers

  must be onboard at all times.</p>
<p align="justify">3 ….</p>
<p align="justify">4 ….</p>
<p align="justify">5 ….’</p>
</font>
</ol>
</font>
</p><p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.    Appendix 1 provided for a minimum of seven crew

for the type of vessel applicable to the Vessel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3"><i><b>Arguments for Gulf Agency</b></i></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.    Mr Raymond Ong, Counsel for Gulf Agency, did not

dispute that a minimum crew had to be retained during the arrest. He also did not dispute

that had the Interveners been repatriated earlier, the arresting party would have had to

engage a replacement crew and would also have asked for the wages and disbursements of the

replacement crew to be part of the Sheriff’s expenses. However he stressed that in

the present case, the arresting party had not engaged a replacement crew and there was no

order that the Interveners’ post-arrest wages and disbursements be paid as part of

Sheriff’s expenses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.    Mr Ong submitted that, usually, crew’s wages

and disbursements came under the category of maritime liens which ranked after

Sheriff’s expenses. He referred to various cases but I need refer to only one.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.    In <i>Keppel Corp Ltd v Chemical Bank</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7948&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 346</a>, there were various claims. According to the established order of priorities, they

were:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(1)    sheriff’s expenses</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(2)    plaintiff’s costs of the

  application of the appraisement and sale of the vessel</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(3)    claim of the salvors</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(4)    claim of Keppel Corp Ltd

  (‘Keppel’) who had a possessory lien over the vessel</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(5)    crew’s wages and repatriation

  expenses</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(6)    claim of Chemical Bank as

  mortgagees of the vessel</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(7)    several other claims for

  necessaries.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.    The vessel was worth about $10 million. This was

only sufficient to pay the first three claims in full and a small part of Keppel’s

claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.    The crew members refused to leave until their

outstanding wages had been paid and arrangements for repatriation had been made. Neither

the salvors nor Keppel were willing to advance the money to meet the wages and

repatriation expenses. To break the impasse, Chemical Bank was prepared to advance the

money to pay the wages and repatriation expenses even though it would not receive any part

of the sale proceeds. However, it wanted such payment to be treated as Sheriff’s

expenses and to be reimbursed out of the proceeds of sale. It applied for an order to this

effect.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.    The application was resisted by Keppel only in

respect of the payment of crew’s wages and disbursements. Keppel did not oppose the

payment of crew’s repatriation expenses (viaticum). Keppel’s arguments was that

if the crew’s wages were treated as Sheriff’s expenses, that would be to alter

the established order of priorities.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.    The Court of Appeal decided that whether the

crew’s wages and disbursements should be treated as Sheriff’s expenses depended

on the equities of the case and the category of Sheriff’s expenses was not a closed

category. In the circumstances of that case, the equities were such as to persuade the

court to sanction the treatment of the payment of crew’s wages and disbursements as

Sheriff’s expenses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.    Mr Ong submitted that that case was not authority

for the proposition that crew’s wages and disbursements would always be treated as

Sheriff’s expenses. He referred to Admiralty Law &amp; Practice by Toh Kian Seng,

1998, where p 306 footnote 62 has the following comments about that case:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘62 <i>Keppel Corporation v Chemical Bank</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7948&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 346</a>. There are two unique features in this case: first, the inability of a

  creditor who is prepared to pay the cost of repatriation and wages to recover in full

  their financial outlay merely by stepping into the shoes of the crew and secondly, the

  creditor stood to gain nothing out of the arrangement because of other more superior

  creditors. At p 353, Karthigesu JA considered the equities of the case as being

  sufficiently compelling to warrant categorisation of the wage payment as Sheriff’s

  expenses; a stalemate would have been reached otherwise. It may be wondered to what extent

  the recovery of such outlay as Sheriff’s expenses should become standard practice in

  Singapore, in view of the concerns that such wage claims would effectively be elevated

  into the highest rung on the priority ladder even though the claims may not have been

  adjudicated upon. In respect of the latter, the Court of Appeal proposed that if need be,

  a sum of moneys can be left in court to satisfy any judgment obtained. See also <i>The

  Eastern Lotus</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=1865&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1980] 1 MLJ 137</a> where a mortgagee successfully claimed as

  Sheriff’s expenses expenditure incurred in paying the master and crew because the

  equities of the case were in their favour. ….’</font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.    Mr Ong sought to distinguish the <i>Keppel</i>

case from the present by pointing out that in that case, it was in the interest of all

parties that the crew be paid off so that a sale could be effected. Secondly, a skeleton

crew was actually employed at much lower cost after the existing crew were repatriated.

Thirdly, the sale proceeds in that case were more than sufficient to cover all the

Sheriff’s expenses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.    He also submitted that in the present case, the

crew were anxious to be repatriated before their wages and disbursements were paid, unlike

the <i>Keppel</i> case where the crew refused to leave the vessel until they were paid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.    Mr Ong also submitted that it was not fair to Gulf

Agency who had had to incur expenses both prior to and during the arrest to have to be

effectively saddled with the Interveners’ wages and disbursements after arrest when

Gulf Agency itself would not be fully reimbursed and had also incurred expenses to provide

food and supplies to the Interveners. It was also Gulf Agency who had arrested the Vessel

with a view to its subsequent sale to put a stop to expenses continuing to be incurred in

respect of the Vessel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.    Finally, Mr Ong submitted that if the court was

minded to allow the Interveners’ application, then, the Interveners’ wages and

disbursements for the period when they delayed the sale should not be part of

Sheriff’s expenses. He submitted that the period of their delay was from December

2001 to March 2002, meaning actually three months i.e from December 2001 to end February

2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.    I would also point out that Mr Ong conceded that,

prior to the arrest, Gulf Agency was aware of the requirement for a minimum number of crew

to stay on board the Vessel. However, he submitted that the Sheriff was obliged to

preserve the Vessel and crew only to the extent of ensuring that the crew were fed and

maintained but not to pay their wages and disbursements.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3"><i><b>Counter-Arguments for the Interveners</b></i></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.    Mr Looi pointed out that Gulf Agency itself had

been holding its hands before taking steps to arrest the Vessel. It had held its hands

with a view to enabling the owners to settle claims.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.    Secondly, although Colin Ng &amp; Partners were

aware of the proposed advertisement on 4 January 2002, they did nothing until mid-January

2002 to ascertain whether the advertisement had in fact been published.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.    Thirdly, Gulf Agency had also received some part

payment from the owners during the delay.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.    I would reiterate that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a)    Colin Ng &amp; Partners themselves

  wrote on 21 January 2002 to the owners’ solicitors to say that they would give the

  owners another seven days to settle all claims failing which they would request the

  Sheriff to advertise the sale,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b)    in their subsequent fax dated 30

  January 2002 to the Sheriff (which I have cited in para 12 above), they had reserved Gulf

  Agency’s rights to seek reimbursement of Sheriff’s expenses from the Interveners

  for one week only i.e from 1 February to 8 February 2002.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.    Mr Looi also submitted that the expenses incurred

by Gulf Agency from the date of arrest would be in its capacity as agents of the Sheriff

and not in its capacity as the arresting party. The two should not be mixed up.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3"><i><b>My Decision</b></i></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">47.    I was of the view that this was not a case of

altering the established order of priorities or making an exception to the established

order of priorities.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">48.    In the <i>Keppel</i> case, the crew were seeking

payment of what was primarily pre-arrest wages and disbursements. Likewise in the various

cases which Mr Ong was seeking to rely on. I have emphasized that the application before

me was confined to post-arrest wages and disbursements.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">49.    In my view, the post-arrest wages and

disbursements were in substance Sheriff’s expenses. It did not matter that there was

no prior order allowing the same to be treated as Sheriff’s expenses or that the

Interveners were not engaged by the Sheriff himself or his agents Gulf Agency.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">50.    Gulf Agency knew the requirement of the relevant

regulation, as must the Sheriff. They were content to let the Interveners stay on board to

meet the requirement. As Mr Ong himself had said, the Interveners had wanted to be

repatriated even without payment of their pre-arrest wages and disbursements. Yet although

two of the crew were repatriated, the rest were not. This must be because they were needed

to meet the requirement. I was of the view that the Interveners had effectively been

adopted by Gulf Agency, as the agent of the Sheriff, to meet the requirement, and it did

not lie in the mouth of Gulf Agency to suggest otherwise. I also did not think that the

Sheriff’s obligation was only to feed and maintain the Interveners with supplies. It

extended to paying their post-arrest wages and disbursements.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">51.    Therefore, the Interveners did not have to rely on

the equities of the case. However, even if they had to do so, I was of the view that the

equities of the case were with them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">52.    The Sheriff had had the benefit of the

Interveners’ presence and services to meet the regulatory requirement as a result of

which the Sheriff had saved on having to engage a replacement crew. If Gulf Agency had

thought that it could have engaged a cheaper crew for the Sheriff to replace the

Interveners, it should have done so. The fact that it did not, speaks for itself.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">53.    As regards Mr Ong’s attempt to distinguish

the case before me from the <i>Keppel</i> case, it was my view that it was in the interest

of all parties that the Interveners stayed on after the arrest to meet the regulatory

requirement. Secondly, no replacement crew was engaged in place of the Interveners whose

presence made such an engagement unnecessary. Thirdly, the fact that the sale proceeds in

the case before me were not sufficient to cover the Sheriff’s expenses made it all

the more important that the Interveners should not be left to seek redress from the owners

when the Sheriff had had the benefit of the Interveners’ presence and/or services.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">54.    I should mention that Mr Ong also argued that the

Interveners could still seek redress from other vessels of the owners, but Gulf Agency

might not be able to do so. I presumed that as between Gulf Agency and the owners, Gulf

Agency would take a different position. In any event, I did not agree that the Interveners

should have to look elsewhere when the Sheriff had had the benefit of their presence

and/or services.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">55.    Although I had some sympathy for Gulf Agency who

did not simply abandon its responsibilities, I was not minded to be too sympathetic. Gulf

Agency had arrested the Vessel with a view to selling it so as to stop the daily and other

expenses, which it was incurring, from running. The arrest was also to recoup part if not

all of its own expenses incurred in respect of the Vessel. True, the Interveners might

have benefited from the arrest and subsequent sale, but the arrest was not for altruistic

reasons only, as Mr Ong conceded.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">56.    I would add that my decision was not a case of

punishing Gulf Agency as Mr Ong was suggesting. Gulf Agency and the Interveners were

victims of an unfortunate situation and the outcome had to be in favour of one or the

other.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">57.    As for alleged delay by the Interveners in selling

the Vessel, I took into account various factors.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">58.    First, Gulf Agency itself delayed in having the

Vessel arrested even though it was paying the daily expenses.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">59.    Secondly, after it had arrested the Vessel, Gulf

Agency itself was not prompt in proceeding with the sale. That is why the Interveners had

to intervene and ask to be allowed to take over the sale. The Order of Court allowing them

to do these things was dated 5 December 2001. The first intended advertisement by the

Sheriff was 4 January 2002. Therefore, it was quite clear that the Interveners were not

responsible for the delay in December 2001 up to 3 January 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">60.    As for the delay between 4 January to 28 January

2002, Gulf Agency itself did not follow-up until mid-January 2002. Thereafter, their own

solicitors wrote to the owners’ solicitors to give the owners up to 28 January 2002

to make full payment. The Interveners’ solicitors followed suit. Accordingly, if did

not lie in the mouth of Gulf Agency to complain about delay for this period.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">61.    As for the delay between 29 January to 8 February

2002, the Interveners had been requested by the owners (through solicitors) to grant a

final extension of time. Given that some payments had been made by the owners by then, and

given that the owners’ request for a delay was the final one and for a short duration

of less than two weeks, it was not unreasonable to give them another chance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">62.    Secondly, while Colin Ng &amp; Partners had said

that they had not received prior notice of the intention to delay, up to 8 February 2002,

and were reserving their clients’ rights (for a short period of about a week), they

had on the other hand recognised that it was the Sheriff who had exercised his discretion

to delay the sale and they had said they would abide by it. It seemed to me that Gulf

Agency was prepared to wait for that duration i.e up to 8 February 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">63.    As for the period from 9 to 28 February 2002,

Gurbani &amp; Co had informed the Sheriff to proceed with the advertisement if the Sheriff

did not hear from them by 11 February 2002 (9 and 10 February 2002 being the weekend).

Indeed, on 18 February 2002, it was Gurbani &amp; Co, and not Colin Ng &amp; Partners, who

reminded the Sheriff to proceed with the advertisement which was eventually published on 1

March 2002. Accordingly, I did not agree that the Interveners were responsible for the

delay from 9 to 28 February 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">64.    In the circumstances, I did not think that I

should deprive the Interveners of their post-arrest wages and disbursements for even the

one week for which Colin Ng &amp; Partners had reserved their clients’ rights, let

alone for three months.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">65.    Accordingly, I allowed the Interveners’

application.</font></p>
