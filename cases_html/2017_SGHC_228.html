The first accused person, Muhammad Farid bin Sudi (“Farid”), and the third accused person, Tika Pesik (“Tika”), each claimed trial to a single charge of trafficking in a controlled drug, namely 26.29g of diamorphine, in furtherance of their common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The second accused person, Hamzah bin Ibrahim (“Hamzah”), claimed trial to a charge of having the 26.29g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The charges stated that Farid and Tika made arrangements between 19 and 20 December 2013 for Farid to deliver two packets of granular/powdery substance (which, on analysis, was found to contain 26.29g of diamorphine) to Hamzah on 20 December 2013, and that Farid did so on that day from about 1.40pm to 2 pm while he was in a car with Hamzah. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the elements of the respective charges were made out against each of the accused persons, and I convicted them accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, is death. Section 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that if the two requirements set out in s 33B(2) are satisfied, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement is that the acts of the accused were restricted to those listed in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv) – acts which have been referred to as those of a “courier”. The second requirement, as stated in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), is that the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) certifies that the accused person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Farid met both requirements. His role in the transaction was to deliver the drugs to Hamzah. His packing of the drugs into a plastic bag was incidental to the delivery and he thus acted as no more than a courier. The PP issued a certificate of substantive assistance. Hence, I imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane on him. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hamzah only met the second requirement. He was issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. However, it was clear to me that his purpose after taking delivery of the drugs was to sell them. His involvement in the transaction went beyond that of a courier. I passed the mandatory death sentence on him. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Tika met neither requirement. She had coordinated the supply of the drugs to Hamzah through Farid and another person and could not be said to have acted as a courier. Also, she was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. Hence, I passed the mandatory sentence of death on her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Hamzah and Tika have each filed an appeal against their conviction and sentence. I now provide the reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The undisputed facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I will first set out the undisputed facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arrest of the accused persons and seizure of the exhibits </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 20 December 2013, at about 1.40pm, Farid drove a car bearing registration number SGM 8355Y (“the Car”) to Deck 5 of the multi-storey carpark at Block 632 Senja Road. He parked the Car near the walkway link on Deck 5. Hamzah walked from the walkway link towards the Car, boarded it, and sat in the front passenger seat.

</div> Hamzah wished to dispute the voluntariness of the statements. To that end, Mr Lee applied to recall certain Prosecution witnesses pursuant to s 283(1) of the CPC. The Prosecution objected to the application, submitting that the power to recall a witness pursuant to s 283(1) of the CPC should only be exercised at the close of the case for the defence. As the Prosecution had yet to close its case, the application was premature. Instead, it was open to Hamzah, in his defence, to raise his objections, and then, if necessary thereafter, to apply to court to recall the relevant witnesses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Section 283(1) of the CPC provides that a court may, “on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence… recall and re-examine a person already examined.” I agreed with the Prosecution that the application was premature and that it was not the appropriate stage of the proceedings to apply to recall the Prosecution witnesses. I note that subsequently, when Hamzah gave evidence in his defence, Hamzah confirmed that he would not be challenging the admissibility of the statements. In fact, his evidence closely followed the contents of the statements.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I now turn to the six statements admitted into evidence which were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 21 December 2013 by SI Nizamuddin;

</div> In it, Tika stated that she had nothing to say in response to the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Close of the Prosecution’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence against each of the accused persons and called upon them to give evidence in their own defence. Farid and Hamzah each gave evidence in their own defence and did not call any witnesses. Besides giving evidence in her own defence, Tika called Saravanan as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first accused’s defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Farid did not dispute the Prosecution’s case against him. His case was that in August or September 2013, he became acquainted with Tika. Sometime in October 2013, he was recruited by Tika to deliver drugs for her. In gist, Farid emphasised that he was but a courier who collected and delivered drugs on the instructions of Tika. In respect of the transaction which formed the subject matter of the charge against him, Farid gave an account of the events of 19 and 20 December 2013 which was consistent with the contents of the statements (see [22] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The second accused’s defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Like Farid, Hamzah offered no substantive defence. Consistent with the contents of his statements as set out at [30] above, he recounted the events on 19 and 20 December 2013. He admitted to making arrangements with Tika to purchase <span class="font-italic">satu </span><span class="font-italic">bola </span>of heroin. When he collected the same from Farid, he agreed to purchase an additional <span class="font-italic">setangah bola </span>on credit from Tika. He took delivery of the drugs from Farid while in the Car, during the drive from Senja Road to the junction of Dairy Farm Crescent and Dairy Farm Road. He knew that “A1A1” and “A1A2” contained heroin. At this juncture, I should add that it was not disputed by the parties that, in the Malay language, “<span class="font-italic">satu bola</span>”, “<span class="font-italic">setengah bola</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>and “<span class="font-italic">satu setengah bola</span>” mean “one ball”, “half a ball” and “one-and-a-half balls” respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The third accused’s defence  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As for Tika, she denied any involvement in the transaction. Specifically, she denied having made any arrangements with Farid to deliver the drugs to Hamzah, or having made any arrangements to sell drugs to Hamzah. She claimed to have been “played out” by Saravanan, who was selling drugs, possibly to Farid. At the material time, she was in a relationship with Saravanan, and was staying in his house. Her explanation for the calls made by Farid to her mobile phone was that Saravanan would have had access to her mobile phone and might have used it to contact Farid. Also, it was her position that Farid and Hamzah had falsely implicated her. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Section 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Trafficking in controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to traffic in a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By s 2 of the MDA, “traffic” is defined to include “sell”, “send”, “transport” and “deliver”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Farid and Tika were charged with trafficking by delivering to Hamzah 26.29g of diamorphine pursuant to a common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Section 34 of the Penal Code provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Each of several persons liable for an act done by all, in like manner as if done by him alone</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">34</span>.  When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is instructive to refer to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>”). That was a case which also involved two persons charged jointly for trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of a common intention, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA as well as s 34 of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal explained how s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA interacts with s 34 of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The purpose of s 34 is to impose constructive liability on a secondary offender in relation to an offence arising from a criminal act committed by the actual doer in furtherance of the common intention shared by both of them (at [27]). The actual doer in that case was convicted of trafficking in a controlled drug pursuant to s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the elements of s 34 are satisfied, constructive liability for the criminal act which constitutes an offence is imputed to the secondary offender. There is no need for the elements of that offence to be made out additionally against the secondary offender (at [29]).  Hence, in that case, there was strictly speaking no need for the elements of s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) to be made out against the secondary offender.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To impute liability to a secondary offender under s 34, three elements must be shown: the criminal act, the common intention and participation (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The criminal act encompasses the aggregate of diverse acts done by the actual doer and secondary offender which collectively give rise to the offence that they have been charged with (at [35]). In that case, the criminal act encompassed the secondary offender’s arrangements to take delivery of the bundles of drugs and the actual doer’s collection of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The common intention can form before or during the commission of an offence (at [41]). The existence of the common intention must frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all other relevant circumstances (at [42]). The common intention must include the intention to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer; only then will the criminal act done by the actual doer be considered to have been done in furtherance of the common intention of the actual doer and the secondary offender (at [43]). In that case, the common intention of both the actual doer and secondary offender was to collect any number of bundles of heroin. This thus encompassed the very criminal act for which the actual doer was charged – possession of seven bundles of heroin for the purpose of trafficking (at [56]). In this regard, the Court also found that the secondary offender knew that the drugs being collected were heroin (at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The element of participation requires that the secondary offender participates in any of the diverse acts which altogether forms the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence for which they are charged (at [36]). In that case, the element of participation was made out based on the secondary offender’s arranging for the collection of the bundles and relaying instructions to the actual doer to collect the bundles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Here, Farid is the actual doer and Tika the secondary offender. Applying the propositions above, the Prosecution bore the burden of proving the following.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that Farid committed an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. To make out this offence against Farid the Prosecution must prove the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>and <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>: (a) trafficking, without authorisation, in a controlled drug, and (b) knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug. Knowledge of a controlled drug may either be proved or presumed by invoking the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA (which I will refer to below).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Next, to impute liability to Tika under s 34 of the Penal Code for the offence which arose from the criminal act committed by Farid, the Prosecution had to show three things. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) First, that there was a criminal act committed by Farid and Tika. The “criminal act” here refers to the aggregate of diverse acts committed by Farid and Tika which collectively give rise to the offence they have been charged with. It would encompass the arrangements Farid and Tika made for Farid to collect the controlled drug and deliver it to Hamzah, and his actual act of delivery. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Second, that there was a common intention between Farid and Tika to commit the very criminal act done by Farid, namely trafficking in a controlled drug by delivering it to Hamzah, and that the criminal act committed by Farid was in furtherance of the common intention shared by him and Tika. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Third, that Tika participated in any of the diverse acts which constituted the act of trafficking for which she and Farid were charged. The Prosecution’s case, as particularised in the charge against her, is that she participated in the arrangements for the delivery. This was by (i) calling Farid to ask him to collect and deliver controlled drugs, (ii) receiving calls from him in which he confirmed he had received drugs, and in which she instructed him on packing the drugs, and (iii) calling him to tell him to meet Hamzah and pass the latter the controlled drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hamzah was charged with having in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 26.29g of diamorphine. This is an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA when read with s 5(2). The elements for a charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA are: (a) possession of a controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(1) or s 18(4) of the MDA; (b) knowledge of the nature of the drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA; and (c) proof that possession of the drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan </span>at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In relation to possession and knowledge generally, there are rebuttable presumptions in s 18 of the MDA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18</span>.—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I will first explain my decision to convict Farid and Tika before turning to my decision to convict Hamzah. In relation to Farid and Tika, there is a considerable overlap in evidence. It is convenient to start by considering the criminal act done by Farid and Tika and the common intention between them to do that act. I will then consider whether the elements of s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA are made out against Farid, before considering whether liability could attach to Tika by s 34 of the Penal Code based on the three elements mentioned above (at [40(b)] to [40(e)] in light of her defence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Farid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The criminal act by Farid and Tika encompassed the arrangements Farid made with Tika to deliver the heroin to Hamzah. During the trial, Farid testified that at the material time, he was using his mobile phone “MF-HP”, and that he had saved Tika’s numbers as “Jackie” and “Jackie 2.0” in his contact list in his mobile phone.

It was not in dispute that Farid was in possession of heroin and to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) he had to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge of the nature of the drug (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran A/L </span><span class="font-italic">K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 at [24]). He did not lead any evidence to rebut the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As a matter of fact, to reiterate, Farid did not dispute the Prosecution’s case against him. He only maintained that he was a courier, and therefore that the court had a discretion not to impose the death penalty on him. However, it was important to bear in mind that the findings against Farid would be relevant to Tika’s case. In light of the foregoing, I found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Prosecution had proved Farid’s and Tika’s criminal act which involved the arrangements with Tika and Farid’s delivery to Hamzah. The Prosecution had also proved that Farid’s delivery to Hamzah was in furtherance of the common intention with Tika to traffic in a controlled drug. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Prosecution had also made out the elements of s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) MDA against Farid. The Prosecution had proved that (a) Farid trafficked in a controlled drug, namely diamorphine; and that (b) Farid knew the nature of the drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, as the elements of the charge against Farid had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I convicted him of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tika </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As mentioned, what had to be proved against Tika was the criminal act done by Farid and her, the common intention between Farid and her to traffic in a controlled drug by delivering it to Hamzah, and that she participated in any of the diverse acts which constituted the offence of trafficking for which she and Farid were charged. In convicting Farid, I have already stated that I found the criminal act of the parties to be the arrangements made for Farid to deliver the drugs to Hamzah, and that the common intention between Farid and Tika was for Farid to carry out the delivery. From these findings, it should be clear that it was also my view that Tika participated in the diverse acts, by making the arrangements for Farid to collect and deliver the drugs to Hamzah.

It was not in dispute that she and Saravanan were in an intimate relationship at the time, and that on 19 and 20 December 2013, she and Saravanan were in Johor Bahru together. It was also not in dispute that after Saravanan’s arrest at the immigration checkpoint on 8 September 2014, he was subsequently charged and convicted of abetting another person (a male Malaysian) to import diamorphine into Singapore, an offence under s 7 read with s 13(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">K Saravanan Kuppusamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 5 SLR 88). In essence, Tika’s case was that Saravanan was the mastermind who was involved in the transaction, and that she had no knowledge of Saravanan’s involvement with drugs. However, I found that all the specific claims she made to support this defence were unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, Tika claimed that she had not known that Saravanan was involved in drug trafficking until they were arrested at the immigration checkpoint, whereupon Saravanan said that the arrest was because of Farid and that he would “take responsibility”.

This mobile phone was not seized by the CNB. As she was often together with Saravanan, he would use the mobile phone whenever he wanted.

</div> The first instance was when Hamzah made a gesture to Farid during the photography of the exhibits telling him to take responsibility; the second was when, also during the photography of exhibits, he whispered words to Farid to the same effect; the third was when he asked another prisoner to pass such a message to Farid when they were charged in court; and the fourth was during a conversation in a prison van when they were on the way to attend a court hearing. The contents of the communications disclosed by Farid show only that Hamzah had asked Farid to exculpate Hamzah. In none of these instances did either of them mention Tika, much less discuss pushing the blame to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Indeed, in their statements, Farid and Hamzah had separately named “Kakak” or “Nana” or “Ika” as the person they dealt with, and then separately identified Tika, from photo boards, as the person they dealt with. Farid also pointed out that Hamzah referred to Tika as “Ika”. I should add that it was Tika’s evidence that she enjoyed a close relationship with Farid, who had even brought his mother and family to meet Tika in Johor Bahru for a shopping trip.

There was no reason to doubt his identification of Tika. As for Hamzah, his testimony was clear, and was consistent with his statements which set out Tika’s role as his contact for the supply of the drugs.

</div> She was thus not in Singapore when Farid delivered the drugs to Hamzah.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This appeared to be an attempt to invoke the presumption that a statute has no extraterritorial application in the absence of express words to the contrary (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Taw Cheng Kong </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 at [66]–[68]). The presumption means that acts committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of Singapore are not offences under Singapore law unless expressly stated otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, that presumption could not be invoked here because Tika’s acts were committed in Singapore. I reached this conclusion by analogy with the result in <span class="font-italic">Wong Yuh Lan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 4 SLR 845. In that case on extradition, the question before the High Court was whether, pursuant to the rule of double criminality (which requires that the conduct forming the basis of the charge be punishable in both the extraditing state and the requesting state), an act of conspiracy would constitute an offence in Singapore. Choo Han Teck J held that an act of abetment that consisted in sending email correspondence which was received by a person in Singapore could be construed as having been committed within the territorial jurisdiction of Singapore (at [28]). Choo J further held that it would be artificial to regard an act of abetment as having been committed in Singapore only if the communications had taken place during a physical meeting in Singapore, as opposed to a phone call, email or letter from an abettor overseas to a person in Singapore. In criminal motions which arose from the case, the Court of Appeal observed that Choo J did not apply the statutory provision in question extra-territorially; he had found that the act had taken place in Singapore “because <span class="font-italic">the recipient of the communication was in Singapore</span>” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Hia Soo Gan Benson v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 4 SLR 57 at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Here, it was undisputed that Farid was in Singapore on 19 and 20 December 2013 when he communicated with Tika over his mobile phone and received instructions from Tika relating to the delivery of the drugs.

</div> It was implicit from this testimony that Hamzah took possession of the <span class="font-italic">satu bola</span> of heroin that he had ordered and the additional <span class="font-italic">setengah bola</span> that Farid had with him. This was consistent with what he had said in his statements (see [30(e)] above). It was evident that he had taken physical possession of the bundles from Farid. In fact, as Farid recounted, Hamzah even physically inspected the bundles by feeling them in his hands (see [22(h)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Since Hamzah stepped out of the Car and left the bundles inside, where Farid remained waiting for Hamzah’s return, it might have been argued that, at the time Hamzah was arrested, physical possession of the bundles was with Farid, not Hamzah. Even so, based on s 18(4) of the MDA, Hamzah would be presumed to have been in possession of the bundles containing diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Prosecution submitted that the presumption would have been triggered because Farid, “with the knowledge and consent” of Hamzah, had the two bundles in his possession; s 18(4) would therefore have operated to deem the bundles to be in the possession of Hamzah as well.

This is reinforced by the fact that he inspected the bundles using his hands while Farid was driving them to Dairy Farm Road. He thus had control over them. Hence, even though Hamzah left the drugs in the car in Farid’s possession, this was with Hamzah’s “knowledge and consent”.

By s 5(2) of the MDA, a person commits the offence of trafficking once it is shown that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking (in this case, by sale), and there is no need to show the overt act of trafficking which he had intended to do (<span class="font-italic">Lee Yuan Kwang and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 778 at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Therefore, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt all three elements of the charge. As stated above at [58]–[62], the evidence given by Hamzah also supported the Prosecution’s case against Tika. In this regard, one of Tika’s contention was that there was an absence of any record of calls between Tika and Hamzah in the FORT report of Hamzah’s mobile phone “H-HP2”. Hamzah’s evidence was that he had used “H-HP2” to call and receive calls from Farid and Tika. Although his calls with Farid were recorded in the FORT report in relation to Farid’s mobile phone “MF-HP”, there were no records of calls to and from Farid in the FORT report for “H-HP2”. In the Prosecution’s submission, the explanation for this was that the date and time of “H-HP2” had not been set to actual date and time.

</div> On 20 December 2013, “H-HP2” had been set to the date of 21 January 2010, and accounted for the lack of records of calls for 19 and 20 December 2013 with Farid and Tika. I accepted this explanation, and found that the lack of call records did not detract from the cogency of Hamzah’s evidence against Tika.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Hamzah’s letter to court after the trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I should add that after the trial, in a letter to the court dated 22 March 2017, Hamzah claimed that there were other “pointers” he wished to be put before the court. In his letter he claimed he had noted down these “pointers” from having read his statements to CNB as well as those of Farid. He alleged that he had given these “pointers” to his counsel, but they did not present them at trial. The letter made no mention of what these “pointers” were.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I thus asked for a hearing to be fixed on 15 May 2017 with counsel for all parties to address the matters raised in his letter. Yet, when asked what “pointers” he wished to raise, Hamzah was still unable to articulate these “pointers”, or any clear defence to the charge against him for that matter. In fact, he still admitted to the contents of his statements to the CNB, but seemed to take issue with Farid’s statements to the CNB. Even at that stage, Hamzah did not raise any relevant or material points to constitute a defence.

He had brought along smaller empty plastic packets for the purpose of repacking the drugs and then selling them subsequently. His role therefore went beyond that of a courier. Hence, although the PP issued a certificate of substantive assistance, the alternative sentencing regime was not available. Thus, I passed the mandatory sentence of death on Hamzah. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tika</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As for Tika, the Prosecution submitted that she was not a courier because she had directed the entire transaction and had gotten Farid to deliver drugs on her behalf to her customer Hamzah.

She had coordinated the supply of the drugs to Hamzah to Farid through the Malaysian from whom Farid had collected the drugs at Woodlands.
