<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 The Plaintiff is the Executrix and sole

beneficiary of the estate of the late Lim Mah Chan ("the deceased"). Her claim

against the five Defendants was in respect of seven insurance policies taken out by the

deceased. Five of these were travel insurance policies for a total insured sum of

$800,000. The other two policies were issued by the Second Defendants – a personal

accident policy issued on 22 January 1996 and renewed on 27 December 1996 for $20,000 and

a life assurance policy issued on 25 January 1996 for $7,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 The crux of the Plaintiff’s claim

was that the 60 year old deceased died through accidental drowning in a bath tub in a

hotel while on holiday in Cambodia with his nephew, Lim Chok Young, the Plaintiff’s

ex-husband, and that the five Defendants breached the contracts of insurance by failing or

refusing to pay the insured amounts. The Cambodian trip was a five-day tour from 30 May to

3 June 1997. On 2 June 1997, the deceased was found naked and lying face down in a filled

bath tub in the hotel room by his nephew who was sharing the hotel room with the deceased.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The five Defendants claimed that death

by accidental drowning was not proved and/or the deceased was a victim of homicide by the

Plaintiff’s ex-husband and that it was therefore against public policy to allow the

Plaintiff’s claim. Alternatively, they averred that the Plaintiff and her ex-husband

conspired to kill the deceased in order to claim the insured amounts. The Defendants also

raised several other defences relating to material non-disclosure and breach of the

insurance policies. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 It was not in dispute that, besides the

seven insurance policies in issue, there was another insurance policy taken out in the

name of the deceased with Great Eastern Life Insurance Co Ltd ("GE Life") for

$100,000 and that the insured amount had been paid by GE Life to the Plaintiff upon a

claim being made. It was also agreed that applications for three personal accident

policies in the deceased’s name were made on 23 May 1997 (one week before the tour)

to the American International Assurance Co Ltd ("AIA") and were rejected by AIA

on 10 June 1997 (one week after the tour). These three AIA policies were for a total

insured sum of $310,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 For easy reference, the various

policies, as tabulated by the Defendants, are listed below (in addition to the two

policies issued in 1996 by the Second Defendants mentioned in paragraph 1 of this

judgment):</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 The first three witnesses of the

Plaintiff were Cambodians. They were part of an Investigation Committee formed to look

into the death of the accused. The Plaintiff did not manage to file their affidavits of

evidence-in-chief and they therefore testified orally. All three gentlemen spoke in the

Khmer language.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 Hun Sothy has been a police officer in

Cambodia for about 17 years. His duties and training included going to study the scenes of

crime and to analyse any bodies found. He explained that an Investigation Committee

comprising representatives from various government departments would be established

whenever there was a case involving the death of a foreign national.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 On 2 June 1997, he received a report

from the police sometime after 1 pm that a man had died in Room 505 of the Pailin Hotel.

He ordered the room to be sealed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 When he arrived at the hotel at about 2

pm, some members of the Investigation Committee were there. They waited for the rest to

arrive before entering the hotel room.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 He interviewed Lim Chok Young, a

chambermaid of the hotel and an employee from the photography shop near the hotel. The

timing of the incident as told by the latter two was consistent with that narrated by Lim

Chok Young. The Investigation Committee examined the bedroom and the bathroom and found

nothing unusual. There was nothing present at the scene that could have been used as a

weapon. There was no sign of forced entry or of struggle. The floor in the bathroom was

slippery because it was wet. The water level in the bath tub was very low because the

water had been flowing slowly into the drainage hole. There was no blood stain in the

bedroom or in the bathroom. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 The deceased’s body (now clothed)

had been placed on the bed earlier. It was moved by the Investigation Committee to the

floor. They examined the body and found a scratch mark on the left cheek measuring 1 cm

long and 0.5 cm wide. There was no blood seen at the scratch. Another similar scratch mark

was found on the right arm of the deceased near the wrist.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 Based on all the above, the

Investigation Committee concluded that the deceased had died from drowning. The

investigations concluded at about 5 pm that day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 The translated report of the

Investigation Committee stated as follows:</font></p>

Committee’s conclusion was a collective one made after all the individual members,

who were specialists in their own field, had expressed their opinion. They felt that the

scratch marks on the deceased’s left cheek could have been caused by him falling and

scratching against a hard object, which could have been the bath tub, the tap or the wall.

It was most likely the bath tub as the deceased could have fallen on a hard object with a

smooth surface. He did not think the scratch marks on the cheek were indicative of a

defensive injury which would be larger. Further, if there was an attacker, there should

also be injuries on the deceased’s head and chest. They did not think it appropriate

to ask Lim Chok Young about the injury on the deceased’s cheek as it was the

Committee’s task to investigate. They also did not examine Lim Chok Young’s

body. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 As for the deceased’s legs, if the

lower portion of his body did not hit against anything hard, there would be no injuries

there. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 Hun Sothy explained that his opinions

were based on his 17 years of experience as a police office during which he examined about

200 dead bodies annually. Although this was the only bath tub drowning case that he had

investigated, he had experience with more than 40 cases of drowning. Lim Chok Young did

not pay any money to the Investigation Committee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 The Chairman of the Investigation

Committee was Prach Nhat, the Chief of the Technical and Scientific Bureau of the

Municipal Police, whose duties included the identification of thumbprints and of documents

and the examination of scenes of crime. According to him, the Committee concluded that the

death was by drowning from the information given that the deceased was weak and had

travelled a lot, from the condition of the bathroom and the other information gleaned from

the interviews with Lim Chok Young and the two chambermaids of the hotel. Although the

conclusions of the Committee were not in their report proper, the Medical Expertise Report

dated 3 June 1997 by Dr Lek Se, another member of the Investigation Committee, formed part

of the Committee’s report. The Medical Expertise Report stated:</font></p>

  on 2<sup>nd</sup> June 1997 at 12h 15 minutes, Mr. Lim Mah Chan went to the bath room, but

  Mr. Lim Chok Yung himself came down to pick up the photo on ground floor for about

  20minutes. When returned to the room, he didn’t see his uncle in the room, and being

  alarmed, he pushed the door of the bathroom open. At that time he saw Mr. Lim Mah Chan in

  the bath tub full of water. He shouted to Sreng Sokhim, sex: female, age: 23, race: Khmer

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 Prach Nhat also emphasized that the

views of the Committee were reached after discussions and were consensual. The Committee

did not receive any payment from Lim Chok Young. He remembered Lim Chok Young telling them

that the deceased was found face down in the bath tub and that one leg was at the top of

the bath tub. He could not recall what Lim Chok Young said about the other leg.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 The final Cambodian witness was Dr Lek

Se, Chief of Surgeon, Gynaecology Unit and Forensic Pathology in Phnom Penh University

Hospital since 1988. He has investigated more than 50 cases of victims who died in water.

Unfortunately, Cambodia did not have the facilities for full autopsies. If there was a

bullet wound, he would do a partial autopsy on the relevant part of the body. Due to this

lack of facilities, the Committee investigating a cause of death would have to consider

all aspects of the case, e.g. information from people who were living with the deceased,

the presence of any unusual objects and an examination of the dead body. If there were

suspicious circumstances, the Committee would inform the higher authorities. The forensic

pathologist would work closely with the police in conducting investigations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 When the Committee arrived at the hotel

room, the deceased had been placed on a bed and had a t-shirt and a pair of shorts on. The

body was still a little wet. They interviewed Lim Chok Young about the medical history of

the deceased and then checked the deceased’s belongings to verify his statements as

they "did not believe 100% the statement of Lim Chok Young". Lim Chok Young told

him that the deceased had no previous health problems but was tired and had no appetite

after his arrival in Cambodia. That was consistent with what the hotel’s staff had

seen. The Committee found no drug prescriptions, drugs or sleeping pills and saw no sign

of forced entry or of struggle in the room.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 Lim Chok Young also told Dr Lek Se that

the deceased had fallen into the water, that his head was inside the water while his

buttocks were above the water, that one leg was inside the tub while the other was

outside. That was again corroborated by the two chambermaids. When the naked body was

taken out from the bath tub, clothes were put on it to protect the modesty of the two

chambermaids. They had tried to revive the deceased by moving his arms and legs up and

down.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 The Committee then carried the deceased

from the bed to the floor of the bedroom and removed his clothes. They then examined the

body, noted the minor scratches on the face and the wrist and took black and white

photographs thereof. There was no blood, no blackness and no swelling at the scratch

marks. They were however recent injuries. They were not sure what could have caused the

scratches, although they could not have been the result of physical blows as there were no

bruises or fractures. Water emerged from the deceased’s mouth and nose when the

abdomen was pressed. His private parts did not show the presence of sperm and his anus did

not have unusual stool. Dr Lek Se stressed that the physical examination lasted more than

an hour and was a very careful one.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 After considering all the physical and

oral evidence, the Committee concluded that death was a result of syncope (or a fainting

spell) and then drowning in the bath tub. This was because there was water in the lungs

and in the stomach. They opined the deceased had syncope because he was a foreigner who

had travelled a lot and the temperature was very hot in Cambodia. Further, the deceased

had been seen by the hotel’s staff to be very weak and Lim Chok Young had said that

he had very poor appetite and the drowning was just before lunch time. While knocking the

head onto something or falling into water could revive a fainting man, the deceased was

weak and his head was in the water. In the Committee’s view, drowning was the sole

cause of death.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26 Dr Lek Se agreed that in theory, an

autopsy should have been done but said that was not possible in the circumstances. The

Committee had done their duty in the best possible way in the situation. If foul play was

suspected, the Public Prosecutor, a member of the Committee, would be informed

accordingly. Further, if an autopsy was deemed necessary, information would be given to

the Courts which could approach the relevant embassy to have the body repatriated to the

country of origin for a full autopsy to be conducted. In this case, there was no suspicion

of foul play and neither did Dr Lek Se consider an autopsy necessary. It would have taken

a long process to repatriate the body in any event and the effectiveness of an autopsy

would be affected by the lapse of time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27 It was difficult to exclude the

possibility that the deceased might have been drugged but the Committee did not suspect

that. Where there was no suspicion of foul play, the body would be released to the

next-of-kin. However, about six to eight hours after the occurrence of death, the body

would be checked again in case there were signs of change. Dr Lek Se did inspect the body

again at about 7 pm that same day at the temple where cremation was to take place and he

saw no unusual signs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28 Under cross-examination, Dr Lek Se said

he had performed about 20 to 30 cases of partial, localized autopsy but never a complete

autopsy. He agreed that it was incorrect to say the cause of death was drowning merely

because water came out of a corpse’s mouth when the stomach was pressed but added

that the other circumstances, in this case, the witnesses’ statements, were taken

into account as well. He also added that the Medical Expertise Report prepared by him was

not a detailed report but was a "summary report".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29 Dr Lek Se opined that it was not

possible to sustain the scratch marks on the left cheek if the deceased was standing

outside the bath tub when he fell. It was possible if he were standing inside the bath tub

when he fell. He did not think the light impact that caused the scratches could have

rendered the deceased unconscious. He opined that the deceased fell into the water, tried

to get up but could not and hence drowned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30 Insofar as the light scratch on the

right wrist was concerned, Dr Lek Se said it could have been caused when the deceased

struggled to get up. Asked how the injury could have been caused if the right arm was at

the back of the deceased’s body, he replied that he did not know what the deceased

was doing prior to putting his hand at his back. He did not agree that the deceased could

have been held in an arm-lock and then forced into the water.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31 Asked whether it was a medical fact

that when injury was inflicted, the bruise might only show up after one full day, Dr Lek

Se said he would estimate it as a couple of hours and agreed that it depended on the size

and the depth of the bruise.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32 Dr Lek Se estimated that the body was

in the water for some 15 to 20 minutes. The Committee excluded the possibility of drug

overdose or of poisoning through their examination of the scene of the incident which

showed no sign of any drugs. They also detected no unusual smell from the body and he saw

no chemical change in the body later that evening. This was the procedure that obtained in

Cambodia although he agreed that in theory, a post-mortem toxicology analysis would have

been necessary in order to exclude medically the possibility of drug overdose or of

poisoning. They could have been drawn a sample of the deceased’s blood or urine but

the difficult part was to get it analysed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33 In re-examination, Dr Lek Se went on to

explain why he did not think that the deceased had been held in an arm-lock and then

forced into the water. That was because there were no signs of any struggle and neither

were there any hair loss or bruises. If the deceased had died before immersion, he could

not have water in the stomach and the lungs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34 The Committee’s consensus was that

the deceased was standing near the bath tub or with one leg inside the bath tub, which was

slippery, when he had syncope and fell into the water. Due to his poor health and the long

travel, he could not get out of the water and he therefore drowned. The tap or the edge of

the bath tub could have caused the scratch marks found on his body.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35 Asked by the Court whether he would

have done anything differently if he had been told that the deceased had taken out about

US$450,000 in insurance policies, that his nephew had helped procure those policies, that

the beneficiary was the ex-wife of the nephew and they were then living together again, Dr

Lek Se replied that they would look further but would have the same conclusion.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36 The Defendants’ expert, Dr Gilbert

Lau, Director of Forensic Pathology in the Department of Forensic Medicine, was the next

witness to testify although the Plaintiff had not closed her case. I shall deal with his

testimony when I narrate the Defendants’ case.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE DEFENDANTS’ NOTICE FOR FURTHER

DIRECTIONS</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37 On the morning of the third day of the

trial, there was a small measure of drama. The Defendants applied by way of Notice for

Further Directions for liberty to re-amend their Defence at paragraph 15 (b) thereof to

include an averment that they require the Plaintiff to prove the alleged relationship of

Lim Chok Young to the deceased and for leave to call a further witness. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38 Lek Siang Pheng, Counsel for the

Defendants, in his affidavit filed on 19 July 2000, said that on the morning of 18 July

2000, he received a telephone call in his office from one Tan Yong Chong who informed him

that he was calling on behalf of a relative of the deceased who could not speak English.

When Lek told the caller that he was able to converse in Mandarin, the caller told him to

contact one Sim Chye Huat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39 Lek then spoke to Sim Chye Huat who

claimed to be the brother of the sister-in-law of the deceased. He said that he had seen

the photograph of the deceased published in The New Paper on 15 July 2000 and in the

Chinese press on 17 July 2000. He alleged that the deceased did not have a nephew named

Lim Chok Young and that the deceased’s family was shocked to learn of his death and

that someone was passing himself off as the nephew. Sim then faxed to Lek’s office a

copy of an obituary dated 24 January 1992 as well as a photograph of the deceased when he

was alive and attending Sim’s wedding. He said that the deceased had a brother and a

sister and the obituary was that of the wife of the deceased’s late brother.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40 Lek went on to state that he had given

a copy of the said obituary and the photograph to Counsel for the Plaintiff when the Court

adjourned for lunch on 18 July 2000. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41 The Defendants’ representative who

went to interview Sim found out that the deceased’s brother had passed away in 1998

but his adopted sister Lim Kim Poh was still alive and would be willing to testify in

Court. The Defendants therefore applied for leave to call Lim Kim Poh as an additional

witness. Sim Chye Huat was subsequently also called as a witness.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42 The Plaintiff had no objections to the

application but responded by asking for leave to call three more witnesses – the

mother, the brother and the adopted sister of Lim Chok Young – to testify that while

Lim Chok Young was not a blood relative of the deceased, his father was the

deceased’s "sworn brother". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43 I granted the Defendants’

application and the Plaintiff’s consequential application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE (CONTINUED)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44 The Plaintiff, a sales promoter drawing

a basic monthly salary of $1,000 is the executrix and beneficiary of the estate of the

deceased by virtue of a will made on 22 February 1997. She claimed to be related to the

deceased through her former husband, Lim Chok Young, as the deceased was his uncle.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45 The Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young were

living in a three-room HDB flat in Hougang ("the Hougang flat") until after

their divorce in 1994 when she transferred her share in the Hougang flat to Lim Chok

Young. In 1995, the Plaintiff purchased a new five-room HDB flat in Woodlands ("the

Woodlands flat").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46 The deceased started visiting the

Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young at the Hougang flat more than ten years ago. Lim Chok Young

invited him to stay with them after learning that he was not happy staying with his

friends. The Plaintiff did not object as she found the deceased to be a simple,

undemanding and quiet man with smoking as his only vice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47 After the deceased moved into the

Hougang flat, the Plaintiff helped him with his laundry and cooked for him. About seven or

eight years ago, he told the couple that he had received advice from a Taoist deity to

"adopt" a god-child and asked the Plaintiff if she would like to be his

god-child. Upon her consent, a simple tea ceremony was held to solemnize the relationship.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48 After their divorce in 1994, the

Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young stayed in contact with each other as they had a daughter (now

14 years old) whom they both loved. Lim Chok Young would go to visit the daughter

regularly.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49 In November 1996, the divorced couple

converted to Christianity and attended instruction classes together at the St

Andrew’s Cathedral. Their relationship improved and Lim Chok Young visited the

Plaintiff and their child more frequently at the Woodlands flat and stayed overnight there

occasionally. In 1998, Lim Chok Young, who had purchased a three-room HDB flat in Yishun

("the Yishun flat") after the divorce, sold the Yishun flat and moved in with

the Plaintiff and their daughter. They were happy to be reunited as a family.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50 The deceased would visit the Woodlands

flat with Lim Chok Young or by himself. He would also stay overnight there occasionally.

The deceased had bought a three-room HDB flat at Petir Road ("the Petir Road

flat") through the financial assistance of Lim Chok Young.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51 The Plaintiff was aware that Lim Chok

Young and the deceased had travelled to Thailand and to Malaysia for holidays. She had

never travelled with the deceased but had gone on holiday with Lim Chok Young to China in

1995 and to the USA and South Korea in 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52 The Plaintiff was not aware of the

travel insurance policies that the deceased had taken out for his trips and was also

ignorant of the fact that the deceased had made a will and named her as the sole

beneficiary. She discovered all these only after his death in Cambodia. The will dated 22

February 1997 appointed her as the sole executrix and trustee and devised and bequeathed

the Petir Road flat and all of the deceased’s properties to the Plaintiff.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53 In 1997, Lim Chok Young telephoned the

Plaintiff one night from Phnom Penh to tell her that the deceased had died in an accident.

She was very surprised and shocked. She knew that the deceased was fine before he left for

the tour with Lim Chok Young and that he had never complained about any major illness. Lim

Chok Young asked her whether they should bring the deceased’s body back to Singapore.

When she learned that it would be very costly to do so, she agreed with Lim Chok Young

that the deceased be cremated in Phnom Penh and his ashes be brought home.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54 Subsequently, Lim Chok Young brought

the deceased’s ashes to Singapore and placed his remains at the Mandai Columbarium.

Lim Chok Young did some prayers there. However, the Plaintiff was not there as she was

very busy working. There was no funeral or announcement of the death through an obituary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55 Later, Lim Chok Young informed the

Plaintiff about the travel insurance policies and she asked him to help her notify the

insurance companies in question. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56 The Plaintiff went on to state that she

could not understand why the Defendants were refusing to pay on the policies when the

Cambodian authorities had already certified that the deceased drowned in the bath tub. She

was very surprised that the Defendants were alleging criminal conduct on the part of Lim

Chok Young and that she was part of the conspiracy to murder the deceased for the

insurance monies. Lim Chok Young was very close to the deceased and she did not believe

that "he would want to cause his uncle’s death to gain from the travel insurance

policies".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57 In cross-examination, the Plaintiff

said that the deceased started to visit them at the Hougang flat in 1988 and, since mid

1988, started to bring along some of his belongings to the flat. The deceased told them he

was a general worker then. Lim Chok Young treated the deceased well and the deceased liked

him very much. She did not know whether the two men were related by blood but they were

"something like father and son". Lim Chok Young only told her that the deceased

was his uncle or his father’s younger brother. She did not know about the

deceased’s siblings or anything about him being a sworn brother of Lim Chok

Young’s father until the second day of the trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58 Asked whether stating that the deceased

had "no other relative" in a Statutory Declaration dated 11 June 1997 (AB 264)

meant that she had already known that the deceased and Lim Chok Young were not related,

she disagreed and stated that she did not know why Lim Chok Young, as the nephew of the

deceased, could not have sworn the Statutory Declaration himself. She meant that the

deceased was not married and had no offspring.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59 Asked when her relationship with Lim

Chok Young became good again after their divorce, the Plaintiff said that it was after

they attended counselling sessions at the church and were baptised in November 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60 It was Lim Chok Young who came up with

the money for the deceased’s Petir Road flat. The deceased did live in that flat but

she was uncertain about the period. One of the two bedrooms there was rented out. The

deceased would still stay at the Plaintiff’s Woodlands flat every now and then. She

did not know who collected the rental but Lim Chok Young did give the deceased money for

his living expenses. She did not know why the Petir Road flat was given to her instead of

Lim Chok Young. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61 Asked when Lim Chok Young started to

live with her in the Woodlands flat, her reply was, "After our baptism in November

1996, after he sold his Hougang flat, he came to stay with me". She added that Lim

Chok Young had also stayed over at the Woodlands flat after their divorce and before their

baptism. The Plaintiff agreed that she, Lim Chok Young and their daughter had gone to

South Korea on holiday together in November 1996, by which time she had regarded Lim Chok

Young as her husband again.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62 Asked whether she agreed that the

deceased was not a person who would plan financially for his future, the Plaintiff said he

was like that previously until she suggested to him that he should keep some money for

himself by saving. The deceased listened and nodded and began to change a lot by taking

care of himself. The deceased was very happy when he was with the Plaintiff who cared so

much that she would remove the bones from the fish she cooked for his meals before serving

it to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63 The Plaintiff also agreed that the

deceased had no regular source of income and when he had no money, he would often go

hungry. He did not have any bank account and had no savings. He would always spend his

money on cigarettes while buying rice and canned food occasionally. Occasionally, the

deceased won in 4-D lotteries and would buy and bring a lot of things home. He would also

speak to a female insurance agent who went to the Woodlands flat but the Plaintiff did not

ask him whether he bought any policies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64 The deceased was unemployed during the

period before his demise. The Plaintiff did not know why he required so much insurance

coverage in April and May 1997, something she found strange. She was not aware that he had

also applied to AIA for three other policies in May 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65 Asked when she discovered the

deceased’s will, the Plaintiff explained that she and Lim Chok Young went to the

deceased’s Petir Road flat after his death and she found some documents inside a box

which she showed to Lim Chok Young as she was not literate in English. Lim Chok Young then

told her that the deceased had bought insurance. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66 When Lim Chok Young and the deceased

travelled together overseas, they did not tell her about the trips before they left. In

fact, she did not even know that the two of them had gone to Cambodia until the telephone

call came from Lim Chok Young bringing news about the death which caused her to cry. She

did not even know where Cambodia was. Lim Chok Young asked her over the telephone to go to

the travel agency at Golden Mile to fax over a document stating that she was the

deceased’s relative. There was no discussion about any insurance policies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67 In re-examination, the Plaintiff said

that Lim Chok Young and the deceased would visit her daughter at the Woodlands flat

together. Occasionally, the deceased would go to the flat by himself and would also stay

overnight. She had given them the keys to the Woodlands flat. She gave the keys to Lim

Chok Young because their daughter was still young and he said he would like to visit their

daughter. The Plaintiff had to work and could not afford a maid. Initially, she was not

happy about the two men’s visits as she and Lim Chok Young had already gone through

the divorce. However, she permitted them to visit because of her daughter. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68 Although probate of the deceased’s

estate was granted to the Plaintiff, it was Lim Chok Young who was administering the

estate. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69 She reiterated that she was very upset

by the allegations of criminal conduct and by the publicity in the press concerning this

case. She maintained that she had cared for the deceased and was happy with her life,

giving hardly any thought to money. Even if she hated someone, she would not go to the

extent of killing him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70 In reply to my questions, the Plaintiff

explained that after the divorce in 1994, she continued to live at the Hougang flat for

about a year or so because her daughter was schooling in the vicinity. She and Lim Chok

Young had applied for a five-room Woodlands flat from the HDB some time back and she took

over this flat after the divorce. She obtained possession of the Woodlands flat sometime

about 1996. The matrimonial home – the Hougang flat – was sold at the end of

1995 for $130,000 and she got back her CPF contributions, together with interest, paid for

that flat. The Woodlands flat cost $130,000. It was purchased direct from the HDB and the

instalment payments were currently being serviced through her CPF account.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71 The Plaintiff also said that after the

Hougang flat was sold, Lim Chok Young moved to the Woodlands flat and agreed that after

their divorce, both never ceased to stay together. When questioned about Lim Chok

Young’s ownership of the Yishun flat, she replied that he bought that three-room flat

because he wanted to earn extra income from renting out one of the two bedrooms. She then

added that Lim Chok Young lived at two places – sometimes at the Woodlands flat and

sometimes at the Yishun flat . When they quarrelled, Lim Chok Young would stay at the

Yishun flat. She then added further that she and Lim Chok Young would stay sometimes at

the Yishun flat and sometimes at the Woodlands flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72 The deceased would also stay in both

the said flats except that he stayed at the Yishun flat most of the time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73 The Plaintiff said that she was angry

because Lim Chok Young spent a lot of time with the deceased in 1995 and 1996. When asked

what led to the divorce in 1994, the Plaintiff explained that she and Lim Chok Young

hardly talked to each other after the deceased moved in with them at the Hougang flat. The

two men got along very well with each other and did not bother about her. On one occasion,

Lim Chok Young was out of the house for a few days and when questioned by her concerning

his whereabouts, he told her not to bother him. At times, he would shout at the Plaintiff

or was very cold when he spoke to her.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74 After she moved to the Woodlands flat,

Lim Chok Young asked for access to their daughter. She then gave him the keys to that

flat. She also did not want her daughter’s schoolmates to find out about their

divorce. She then added that Lim Chok Young and the deceased were still living in the

Hougang flat after she had moved out. However, because of their daughter’s problems

with transport, she moved back to the Hougang flat and would return to the Woodlands flat

on weekends and on her days off from work. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75 Asked how long such an arrangement

lasted, the Plaintiff said it was not very long. After the Yishun flat was bought by Lim

Chok Young, the Hougang flat was sold and they moved to the Yishun flat. There, they again

could not get along with each other and the Plaintiff returned to the Woodlands flat. Lim

Chok Young remained at the Yishun flat and gradually moved to the Woodlands flat. She

explained it was because of all this that she was so confused in her testimony about which

flat she was living in. None of the HDB flats in question had a long bath tub in the

bathrooms. The conservancy and utility charges for the Woodlands flat were paid by Lim

Chok Young since he had gone to live there with the Plaintiff.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76 The Plaintiff also said that she and

Lim Chok Young had resumed an occasional sexual relationship after the divorce. She could

not remember when they resumed such a relationship because it was not a recent event. She

confirmed what Lim Chok Young had stated in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, that they

intended to re-marry. She explained that it was for the sake of their daughter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77 The divorced couple still had a POSB

account in their joint names. The Plaintiff explained that that was an old account used by

Lim Chok Young to pay the utility bills. The Plaintiff had never used this account

herself. As for the $100,000 insurance money paid out by GE Life, the Plaintiff said the

cheque was made out in her name but she could not recall where she banked it into. Money

was not that important to her, she explained. (Lim Chok Young would testify later that the

$100,000 cheque was used to open a fixed deposit account in their joint names.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78 When they discovered the insurance

policies and the will in the Petir Road flat after the deceased’s death, the

Plaintiff was shocked that the deceased had left so much money for her and was concerned

that people might misunderstand the situation. Lim Chok Young also wondered why the

deceased had given her so much money. He was also surprised that the deceased had all

those insurance policies and had made a will.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79 When Lim Chok Young telephoned her from

Cambodia to inform her about the deceased’s demise, he told her to fax over a letter

of authorization as there was a requirement there that only the relative of the deceased

could claim the deceased’s ashes after cremation. She faxed it over the next day. She

did not know why that was necessary as Lim Chok Young was the deceased’s nephew while

she was only his god-daughter. The Cambodian authorities apparently wanted someone from

Singapore to fax over the said document. Asked why she was described as

"step-daughter" of the deceased by the Singapore Embassy in Phnom Penh in their

letter dated 3 June 1997 to Lim Chok Young to authorize him to have the deceased’s

body for cremation, the Plaintiff said that the person in the tour agency who prepared the

letter of authorization for her must have translated "god-daughter" wrongly. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80 In response to her own counsel, the

Plaintiff explained that she had divorced Lim Chok Young in 1994 because she was very

angry with him. She wanted to use the divorce to frighten him into treating her well

again. During the divorce proceedings, Lim Chok Young tried to dissuade her from

proceeding but she was adamant. She maintained that the divorce was no sham. While she

remained in the Hougang flat after the divorce, she was still hoping for a reconciliation.

When she moved to the Woodlands flat, she had lost all hopes of reconciliation. She had

gone to Lim Chok Young’s Yishun flat and walked about aimlessly, eventually going up

to his flat probably because she was still thinking about him. The church counselling was

then going on and she was still hoping that they could get back together. Their decision

to get back together again had nothing to do with the insurance monies in question. It was

due to the counselling sessions and to Lim Chok Young consoling her when she felt down.

She felt that he still loved her and their daughter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81 Lim Chok Young affirmed two Affidavits

of Evidence-in-Chief. In the first one, he said he was working for the Ministry of the

Environment as a container truck driver earning a month salary of about $1,600. The

deceased was his father’s younger brother. He had met the deceased at family

gatherings. Sometime in the 1980s, he met his uncle again and learned that he was staying

with some friends and was then an odd job labourer. He then invited the deceased to the

Hougang flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82 The deceased began to visit him and the

Plaintiff frequently and would stay overnight for several days. They all got along well

with one another. The deceased complained about his living arrangements with his friends

and, as his relative, Lim Chok Young felt sorry for him and invited him to live with his

family temporarily. The deceased accepted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83 His uncle was not married and had no

children. About seven to eight years ago, he decided to take the Plaintiff as his

god-daughter. He was a quiet man of simple needs and not given to consuming alcohol. He

would usually smoke a packet of cigarettes daily and sometimes would go to a Taoist temple

to pray.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84 In 1994, Lim Chok Young and the

Plaintiff divorced. In her petition dated 23 May 1994, the Plaintiff stated the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"9. That the marriage has

  irretrievably broken down.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. That the Respondent has behaved in

  such a away that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent.

  (Section 88(3)(b), Cap. 353).</font></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<u><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">PARTICULARS</font></p>
</u>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a) That since marriage, the Respondent

  failed to provide sufficient maintenance to the Petitioner and the child. The Respondent

  gave meagre sum towards maintenance and only on demand. As a result, the family and

  household expenses were provided for by the Petitioner.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b) That since marriage, the Respondent was

  in the habit of keeping late nights. When questioned about his late nights, the Respondent

  would quarrel with the Petitioner and the Petitioner was told not to interfere in his

  private affairs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">c) That due to the attitude and behaviour

  of the Respondent, there were frequent quarrels between the Petitioner and the Respondent

  whereby the Petitioner became mentally depressed and could not concentrate in her works.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">d) That throughout the marriage, the

  Respondent neglected the family and never showed any love and concern for the Petitioner

  and the child. The Respondent often went out alone without bringing the family along.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">e) That since early 1993, the Respondent

  behaved very cold towards the Petitioner and the Respondent had for no apparent reason

  moved into another room and had without the consent of the Petitioner, refused to resume

  cohabitation with the Petitioner."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Lim Chok Young did not enter an appearance

and the divorce was not contested. Decree Nisi was pronounced on 25 August 1994. On 25

November 1994, a consent order was made on the ancillary matters as Lim Chok Young had

signed a draft consent order containing the same terms on 27 October 1994 before the

solicitor acting for the Plaintiff in the divorce petition. The Plaintiff was given

custody of their daughter with reasonable access to Lim Chok Young. Lim Chok Young was to

pay the Plaintiff $250 per month as maintenance for the child and the Plaintiff was to

transfer her share and interest in the Hougang flat to Lim Chok Young upon repayment to

her CPF account of the monies withdrawn (and interest) for the flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85 In 1996, Lim Chok Young sold the

Hougang flat and bought the Yishun flat in the open market. The deceased moved with him

from the Hougang flat to the Yishun flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86 Despite their divorce, the couple

stayed in contact with each other and Lim Chok Young would go to the Woodlands flat to

visit the daughter and to give her the maintenance money. In November 1996, they were

baptised after attending instruction classes together. Lim Chok Young went to say:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"As a result of our new religious

  belief, we started to get back together, although we were legally divorced. I would go

  over to the Plaintiff’s flat to stay there frequently. I sold off the Yishun flat and

  in July 1998 moved in permanently at the Petitioner’s flat in Woodlands. We are now

  reconciled as a family. We have plans to re-marry after the present matter is

  resolved."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87 In late 1996, Lim Chok Young helped the

deceased to purchase the three-room Petir Road flat by making the cash payment for him. He

had just sold the Hougang flat and therefore had available cash. They had agreed that the

deceased would sublet one of the two bedrooms to get some income to help pay the

instalments for that flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88 In early 1997, Lim Chok Young and the

deceased started to take holiday trips to nearby countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and

Indonesia as the deceased had won several thousand dollars in a lottery in late 1996 or

early 1997. Each time they went on a trip, they would buy travel insurance. Lim Chok Young

explained:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I must explain that I have a very

  strong conviction about the benefits of insurance. This came about when I witnessed a

  colleague’s sudden death around 1978 or 1979. When I was at the funeral wake, I

  learnt that the insurance company (NTUC) had paid out a sum of $15,000 even before the

  body was cremated. This made a very deep impression on me that insurance could take care

  of family needs that arose unexpectedly, such as the sudden death of my colleague. My

  first insurance policy was with NTUC, a 15-year savings policy which has since

  matured."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In 1994, when Lim Chok Young went to

China, he bought $500,000 in travel insurance. He would buy travel insurance whenever he

travelled but he has discarded the policies upon their expiry.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89 Coming back to the Cambodian trip, Lim

Chok Young said that the initial plan was to visit Vietnam on a five-day tour costing

$888.00. Lim Chok Young and the deceased went to tour agencies to scout around for

bargains and came across one at Golden Mile Tower offering a five-day tour to Phnom Penh

for $588.00. As that would result in savings of $300.00 per person, they decided to change

their destination. They booked the tour on 21 April 1997 and paid a deposit of $400.00.

The tour was to take place from 30 May to 3 June 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90 As the deceased had indicated earlier

that he would like to purchase travel insurance for the trip, Lim Chok Young then went to

the First Defendants and handed in an application form on the deceased’s behalf. That

form had been signed earlier on 8 April 1997 as it was originally intended for a trip to

Malaysia and Indonesia. He paid the premium of $79 and was repaid by the deceased later.

He decided not to buy travel insurance for himself from the First Defendants as he felt

the premium was a bit too expensive and he could get better deals elsewhere. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91 Between 21 April 1997 (when the tour

was booked) and 30 May 1997 (the departure date), Lim Chok Young and the deceased bought

the other travel insurance policies in question as they had learnt from speaking to others

that Cambodia was not a safe place, with its unstable social and political situation and

the landmines. They contemplated cancelling the tour but decided to proceed with it upon

learning that their $400.00 deposit would be forfeited. While the deceased bought five

travel insurance policies, Lim Chok Young bought three as he was already covered under

other policies. Lim Chok Young’s policies were with the Second and the Fifth

Defendants and Tai Ping Insurance Co.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92 Lim Chok Young went on to explain how

the various policies came about. He bought from the First Defendants because both he and

the deceased had bought policies from them in February 1997. The next policy (from the

Fourth Defendants) was bought when both of them were shopping as they would walk into

travel agencies to look at the colourful posters. They had also bought travel insurance

from the Fourth Defendants previously in March 1997. The third policy was bought from the

Fifth Defendants through the tour agency where they booked the Cambodian tour. They were

persuaded to buy another policy despite having told the travel agent that they were

already covered by insurance. The fourth policy (from the Third Defendants) was bought on

another shopping trip as it was additional protection at relatively low cost. The fifth

policy was bought from the Second Defendants. Lim Chok Young had policies with the Second

Defendants which had a branch in Yishun Central which he went to frequently as he was

living in the Yishun flat then. The staff there would encourage him to buy more travel

insurance for additional cover.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93 The premiums for the various policies

bought by the deceased were paid by Lim Chok Young first. He was reimbursed later in cash

by the deceased, who was a very proud person who would always insist on paying for his

trips and insurance premiums. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94 Both of them left Singapore on 30 May

1997 for Phnom Penh. The tour group had six persons. They shared room 505 at the Pailin

Hotel there. They had dinner and returned to the hotel at about 9 pm.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95 Day 2 was spent visiting temples and

museums with short rest periods back at the hotel. The day’s programme ended at 9 pm.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96 On Day 3, the deceased said his legs

were aching and he did not like the food and decided not to join the tour group on its

outing. Lim Chok Young went with the group. The deceased joined them for lunch and for

dinner at the hotel. He appeared normal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97 Day 4 (2 June 1997) had no activity

planned but it was to be the most eventful one. The other four members of the group

decided to fly to Siem Reap to tour the Angkor Wat. Lim Chok Young decided to keep his

uncle company as the latter did not wish to go for the optional day trip. Both of them had

breakfast at the hotel and then chatted with the rest of the group in the lobby. A couple

in the group asked Lim Chok Young to develop a roll of film for them at the photo studio

opposite the hotel. He agreed to do so as he also had a roll to develop. He crossed the

road to the said studio and left the rolls of film there. He then went back to room 505

with the deceased. It was past 9 am then.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98 Back in the room, they lazed around,

watched television and chatted. At past 10 am, two chambermaids entered the room to clean

it for about 15 minutes. At about 11 am, Lim Chok Young had his shower. He then took some

coffee and tidied up his luggage. He suggested to the deceased to take a bath before they

went for lunch as the deceased enjoyed bathing in the bath tub because he could not do so

at home. The deceased then turned on the water.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99 At about 11.30 am, Lim Chok Young left

the room to collect the negatives and the photographs from the studio across the road.

Before he left, he informed the deceased to meet him at the lobby at about 12 noon. The

deceased was standing beside the bathroom and the bath tub was still being filled. Two

chambermaids were in the corridor when he left the room. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100 After collecting the negatives and the

photographs, Lim Chok Young returned to the lobby where he inserted the photographs into

the albums while waiting for the deceased. When he did not turn up at about 12.15 pm, Lim

Chok Young went up to the room. The two chambermaids he saw earlier were standing near the

passageway to the room.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101 He unlocked the door and noticed that

the bathroom door was shut and the television set was switched on. He put down the albums

and knocked on the bathroom door. There was no response although there was the sound of

running water. When he pushed the door open, he saw the naked deceased lying face down in

the bathtub filled with water. That scared him and he immediately called for help.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">102 The two chambermaids came running into

the room and they helped Lim Chok Young to lift the body out of the bath tub and onto the

floor. Immediately thereafter, many people went into the room to offer help. Some men

helped to move the body onto the bed. Lim Chok Young put a t-shirt and a pair of shorts on

for the deceased as the chambermaids were embarrassed by the naked body. The authorities

then arrived.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103 Lim Chok Young was asked to go to

another room where he was questioned by the police until the evening. The police also told

him that there was no evidence of suicide or of murder.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">104 Later that evening, Lim Chok Young

telephoned the Plaintiff to tell her about the deceased's demise and discussed with her on

what to do with the body. He had learnt that it would cost US$6,000 to bring the body back

to Singapore. There would also be the attendant documentation. They decided that it would

be more convenient and would save them money to cremate the body and then bring the ashes

home. Lim Chok Young also called the tour agency in Singapore. The tour leader in Cambodia

helped him contact the Singapore Embassy for their assistance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105 The next day (Day 5, 3 June 1997), a

representative from the Singapore Embassy went to view the body which had been moved to a

temple for cremation. The Cambodian authorities did not tell Lim Chok Young whether an

autopsy would be done. If he had known that the absence of an autopsy would lead to such

allegations as had been made against him, he would certainly have brought the body back to

Singapore for an autopsy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">106 Lim Chok Young left Phnom Penh that

day. The cremation took place on 4 June 1997 and he returned to Cambodia a few days

thereafter to collect the ashes which were now kept at the Mandai Columbarium.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107 Lim Chok Young then explained why the

deceased had bought so many travel insurance policies. The deceased had told him that if

some accident should cause him to become handicapped, the insurance monies would help take

care of his medical and nursing expenses as he had no children. He was looking to the

Plaintiff to take care of him since she was his god-daughter. He was also afraid that he

would not be able to pay off the HDB loan for the Petir Road flat if anything untoward

should happen to him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108 As the deceased also told Lim Chok

Young that he wanted to make a will, he brought the deceased to a law firm (the

Plaintiff’s present solicitors). He was not present when the deceased signed the

will. The deceased paid the legal fee himself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">109 Lim Chok Young asserted that he had

nothing to do with his uncle’s death and surmised that the Defendants were making the

unfounded and malicious allegations against him and the Plaintiff to avoid paying on the

policies. The deceased was not suffering from any disease or illness and appeared to be in

good health on the day of departure for the tour. The only two occasions when Lim Chok

Young brought the deceased to see a Chinese physician were for an ache at his wrist and a

skin problem at his feet. He found a Medical Examination Form dated 16 June 1990 in

respect of the deceased after his death. (That examination was apparently for the purpose

of an application for a vocational licence by the deceased. The doctor who did the

examination was not called by the Plaintiff to testify although he had affirmed an

Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">110 Lim Chok Young helped the Plaintiff to

lodge the clams with the various insurance companies. He was questioned by loss adjusters

representing the Defendants about the death and the circumstances leading to the purchase

of so many policies. He told them that he was a "strong believer in insurance".

Perhaps the deceased had been influenced when he saw Lim Chok Young buying insurance

policies so frequently. Lim Chok Young concluded his first Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief

by reiterating his innocence in respect of the death.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">111 His second Affidavit of

Evidence-in-Chief was in response to the Defendants’ first amendment to their Defence

to allege that they had been induced to issue the policies by the deceased’s failure

to disclose or concealment of material facts. Lim Chok Young said that the deceased’s

eye problem was nothing more than poor eyesight for which he wore corrective lenses. The

deceased had applied traditional Chinese ointment on his arms because of the skin

irritation. He had not mentioned any infection or complained that it was painful. The

deceased was almost 61 years at the time of the last trip. His slowness in movements were

therefore nothing unusual. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">112 Except for the First Defendants, where

an application form had been signed earlier for an intended trip to Malaysia and

Indonesia, the deceased went personally to purchase the policies from the other four

Defendants. When Lim Chok Young went to the First Defendants to purchase insurance for the

deceased, no questions were asked on whether the deceased had other insurance policies or

on the deceased’s state of health. However, Lim Chok Young was told that he could

call the First Defendants anytime for emergency help during the trip. As for the two

earlier policies bought from the Second Defendants, it was the agent who filled in the

application form for the deceased who could not understand English. Where the travel

insurance policy bought from the Second Defendants on 27 May 1997 was concerned, similarly

no questions other than those on the destination and the flight details were asked. That

was the same for the Third, Fourth and the Fifth Defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113 Lim Chok Young said he did not know

that the deceased had applied for insurance with AIA in 1996 or that he had gone for a

medical examination in connection therewith until informed by the Defendants’

solicitors. He was aware of the applications for personal accident insurance from AIA in

May 1997 as he had helped the deceased to forward the application forms to AIA. However,

he was not told that the applications had been turned down. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">114 In cross-examination, Lim Chok Young

confirmed that he had been interviewed by Chan Hwee Seng, the loss adjuster representing

the Defendants, and had made the statements shown in AB 197 to 209.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">115 He agreed that the Plaintiff and he

were currently living together as husband and wife although divorced in the eyes of the

law. He helped to pay for the utilities bills of the Woodlands flat. He also confirmed

that they had a joint account which both of them were using.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116 Although Lim Chok Young agreed that

one of the reasons for buying travel insurance was to provide for repatriation from abroad

to receive treatment back home, he did not pay attention to such a provision in the

policies in question.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117 The Petir Road flat of the deceased

cost $133,000. Lim Chok Young paid the whole of the initial down payment of 20% of the

price to the HDB. The monthly instalments came up to about $500. The rental received for

renting out one of the two bedrooms was $900 per month. The difference of $400 was used by

the deceased for his daily expenses. The flat had since been sold for about $130,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118 Lim Chok Young disagreed with the

suggestion that he had made use of the deceased to purchase the Petir Road flat as an

investment for himself. He felt that as he had paid for the flat on the deceased’s

behalf, should the deceased die, he should be entitled to the flat. However, he did not

cause any document to be signed by the deceased to ensure that. He disagreed that he

protected his interest by causing the deceased to make the will in February 1997. The will

was part of an arrangement between Lim Chok Young and the deceased who wanted him to

manage his estate. The deceased had asked him to go with him to see a lawyer and he did

so. They went to the present solicitors through the recommendation of a security guard at

the commercial complex. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119 He was then asked about the $100,000

paid out by GE Life to the Plaintiff in 1998. Lim Chok Young said he went with the

Plaintiff to place the amount in a fixed deposit in their joint names with the Standard

Chartered Bank. The money was withdrawn prematurely from time to time to pay various

expenses, with about $20,000 remaining.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">120 When the cross-examination resumed the

next day, Lim Chok Young corrected his earlier evidence and stated that the $100,000

cheque from GE Life was deposited in a branch of the OCBC Bank near the Woodlands flat.

The fixed deposit account there was also in the joint names of Lim Chok Young and the

Plaintiff. From there, $20,000 was withdrawn for Lim Chok Young to buy a second hand car

and $10,000 was used for their legal fees and other expenses. The balance of $70,000 was

then placed in a fixed deposit in their joint names with the Standard Chartered

Bank’s branch at Tiong Bahru. From that fixed deposit, sums of money were withdrawn

to pay their legal fees, leaving about $17,000 still in that account. Lim Chok Young then

produced an advice slip dated 23 September 1999 from the Standard Chartered Bank (PB 107)

which showed that the 18-month fixed deposit of $70,000 was withdrawn prematurely. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121 Lim Chok Young confirmed that they

would also deposit the $800,000 claimed in these proceedings into their joint accounts

should the Plaintiff succeed in her claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122 Asked by the Court to clarify about

the car bought by him since the Plaintiff had told the Court earlier that neither of them

had a car, Lim Chok Young said he bought the car at the close of 1998 and sold it two or

three months later in February 1999. He sold it because he had no need for a car and had

bought it only because the previous owner needed some money. He did not know that person

very well. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123 Going back to the issue of the will,

Lim Chok Young testified that he and the deceased had discussed the question of who the

beneficiary should be but the deceased did not tell him his decision on that matter. He

did not ask the deceased about it but was quite sure that he would be named as the sole

beneficiary. He knew what the intended contents of the will would be but did not know how

the deceased obtained the Plaintiff’s particulars. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124 He accompanied the deceased on the

first visit to the law firm but the deceased met and discussed with the lawyer alone. The

deceased went by himself on another occasion to collect the will from the law firm.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125 A few days later, Lim Chok Young went

to the deceased’s Petir Road flat and enquired about the will. The deceased then

showed it to him. He was surprised that he was not named the beneficiary. After that, the

deceased kept the will somewhere in the bedroom.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">126 With regard to the exact nature of the

relationship between Lim Chok Young and the deceased, he had thought all along that the

deceased was his late father’s brother until the incident on the second day of the

trial (mentioned earlier). He then checked with his mother and found out that the deceased

and his late father were actually sworn brothers. Lim Chok Young’s father passed away

34 years ago aged slightly older than 40.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">127 Lim Chok Young agreed that it looked

strange for the deceased not to cancel the Cambodian trip and lose $200 each but

eventually pay $275 in premiums for all the travel insurance. If the premiums for the

three unsuccessful applications to AIA were included, the premiums would exceed $1,000.

The policies got cheaper and cheaper as Lim Chok Young bought more insurance. The more he

bought, the better the protection, he explained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">128 For the first policy (from the First

Defendants), the deceased was not with him when he went to buy the insurance. Therefore,

even though he thought the premium of $79 was rather expensive, he bought anyway as

requested to save himself the inconvenience of a second trip. After all, the deceased had

handed him the First Defendants’ application form with his thumbprint on it and would

be reimbursing him anyway. He did this although it was their habit to go around looking at

tour agencies and he was going to buy insurance for himself from other insurance

companies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">129 When the policy was purchased from the

First Defendants, a card listing the services provided together with a 24-hour emergency

service telephone number in Singapore was given by the insurance company. However, Lim

Chok Young said he did not read this information which was on the reverse side of the

card.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">130 Asked why the Fourth Defendants’

policy apparently issued on 15 May 1997 (AB 54) should bear the date stamp 6 March 1997,

Lim Chok Young said he was not able to explain. He also did not know why two policies (AB

39 and 40) issued for earlier trips in March and April 1997 also bore the date stamp 6

March 1997. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">131 Lim Chok Young’s hobby was to

visit tour agencies with the deceased tagging along. They would make enquiries with the

staff who would recommend their policies. That explained why the five travel insurance

policies were bought through different tour agencies. As for the policy from GE Life for

$100,000, Lim Chok Young had opened a joint account with the deceased at OCBC Bank which

had a savings scheme insurance for account holders. He read the terms and conditions of

that scheme and, seeing that the premium was only about $10 per month, bought a policy.

The deceased also bought one. The joint account was opened because the deceased told him

that he had applied for a job for which the salary would be paid by cheque. They opened

the joint account in case the deceased was successful so that he could bank in his cheques

and Lim Chok Young could withdraw money for him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">132 The three unsuccessful applications to

AIA came about this way. Two agents from AIA telephoned the Woodlands flat to look for the

deceased who was not in the flat then. They told Lim Chok Young that they had an

appointment with the deceased. They also knew Lim Chok Young as they had obtained his

particulars from the Standard Chartered Bank. They asked whether they could go over to the

Woodlands flat to discuss insurance matters. Lim Chok Young told them he had no intention

of buying more as he already had several insurance policies. They said they would

recommend something to Lim Chok Young anyway.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">133 When they arrived, they said that the

deceased could buy only accident policies because of his age. They asked Lim Chok Young to

buy insurance for the deceased. Lim Chok Young telephoned the deceased who was at the

Petir Road flat and told him about this. The deceased did not want to buy any. However,

the two agents from AIA were persistent. Lim Chok Young therefore told the deceased that

he was the one who had invited the agents to the Woodlands flat and that they were

refusing to leave. The deceased then relented and told Lim Chok Young to oblige them and

buy $100,000 worth of insurance. However, the agents persuaded Lim Chok Young to purchase

half a million dollars worth instead. He told them the deceased was not working and they

responded by suggesting something in between the two figures – i.e. $300,000 –

and told Lim Chok Young that the deceased could buy only up to the time he attained 65

years of age. The premium was $600 for every half year. They then filled up the

application form and told Lim Chok Young to bring it to the deceased for his signature. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">134 Lim Chok Young said that he had

indicated his wish to join the optional tour of the Angkor Wat at the time of booking but

was not required to make any payment for the optional tour at that time. He disagreed with

the suggestion that he had no intention of visiting the Angkor Wat and had planned to use

that day to carry his plan to cause the deceased’s death. He did not go because the

deceased was weak, he had seen that the Cambodian aeroplane was not very safe, the airport

facilities were poor and there were many soldiers on the road. Besides , it would cost

US$100 per person. They could not leave for Singapore on the fourth day because the

five-day tour was a special promotion. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">135 Lim Chok Young confirmed that the

Pailin Hotel was airconditioned. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">136 Asked why he did not at least lift the

deceased out of the water in the bath tub when he discovered him lying in there, Lim Chok

Young said he thought the deceased wanted to splash water on him. When he had looked

carefully, he then shouted at the top of his voice. He could not have lifted the body out

of the water by himself. In any event, he was in shock. He did not mention his thought

that the deceased wanted to splash water on him in his Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief

because he just recalled that the deceased used to joke with him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">137 When he made the telephone call to the

Plaintiff later that evening, he told her to inform the tour agency about the death and to

send someone over to help. On 3 June 1997, he sought the assistance of the Singapore

Embassy. Since he had heard that it would cost US$6,000 to send the body back, he wanted

to borrow money from the Embassy. The Embassy could not lend him the money unless someone

in Singapore deposited money in Singapore. The Plaintiff was not able to get this amount

of money. The representative from the Embassy told him that it would be more convenient

and less costly to cremate the body in Cambodia. He required two signatures before

approving the cremation and Lim Chok Young therefore telephoned the Plaintiff to prepare

the document and fax it over. During all this time, it did not occur to him that he had

five insurance policies in the deceased’s name as he was pulled from one place to

another. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">138 Lim Chok Young forgot to bring the

emergency service cards issued by his three insurers to Cambodia. It did not occur to him

to contact one of the insurance companies anyway. On 2 June 1997 evening, he told the

hotel’s staff to inform the tour agency in Singapore about the incident and to send

somebody over to Cambodia immediately. The next day, the tour agency called him and told

him to seek the assistance of the Singapore Embassy. He also told the tour agency to

contact the insurance companies but was told to contact the Singapore Embassy instead. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">139 The deceased had also forgotten to

bring the cards containing the emergency telephone numbers of the insurance companies

along on the trip. Both of them intended to bring the cards with them but in the course of

packing forgot to do it. It never crossed Lim Chok Young’s mind while he was in

Cambodia that the deceased had bought five travel insurance policies. Similarly, he did

not think about his own policies. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">140 The deceased had also applied to AIA

for a whole life policy of $30,000 on 1 October 1996. He borrowed money from Lim Chok

Young to pay the $770.90 premium. After some time, the deceased told him it was

troublesome to buy insurance and he did not want to do so anymore. Lim Chok Young then

asked for the return of the money he had borrowed for the premium. The deceased paid him

with a cheque issued by AIA. Lim Chok Young did not know that the application was not

successful. The doctor who examined the deceased for the purpose of the application had

commented in the examination form then that the deceased was of low mentality and behaved

older than his 60 years. Lim Chok Young did not agree with such an assessment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">141 Lim Chok Young claimed that he and the

Plaintiff had gone together to the various insurance companies to submit the claim forms.

When he was asked by the insurance companies to sign on the forms, he did so. That was why

his signature appeared on every claim form while the Plaintiff signed only one claim form.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">142 Asked whether he agreed that he only

started travelling with the deceased after the making of the will in February 1997, Lim

Chok Young claimed that the trips had nothing to do with the will. The deceased was out of

job during that period and kept asking him to go on overseas trips with him as he (the

deceased) was free.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">143 The sale proceeds of the Petir Road

flat were paid by cheque to the Plaintiff who deposited it into their joint account. She

also repaid Lim Chok Young the 20% down payment he had made on the deceased’s behalf.

No profit was made from the sale. The deceased had lived in that flat for less than the

minimum two and a half years and they had to apply to the HDB for permission to sell the

flat in the open market before the minimum period expired as prices of resale flats were

falling. By the time it was sold in 1998, after deducting the mortgage payments, the

agent’s commission and other expenses, there was a net loss. Defence Counsel then

pointed out to Lim Chok Young that the prospective buyer lodged the caveat against the

flat only on 3 March 1999 and completed the sale on 18 June 1999 at the price of $133,000.

Lim Chok Young could not remember the dates but agreed that the sale price was $133,000,

the same as the price paid by the deceased for the flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">144 Lim Chok Young had asked the deceased

why he did not name him as the beneficiary in the will but the deceased smiled and replied

that naming his wife as the beneficiary amounted to the same thing as they were all one

family. He had also questioned the deceased about why he named the Plaintiff as the

beneficiary in some of the insurance policies. The deceased replied it was because the

Plaintiff was his god-daughter and had taken care of him. Further, Lim Chok Young was

travelling with him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">145 Asked to comment on the

Plaintiff’s testimony that he expressed surprise when they found the will and the

policies after the death of the deceased, Lim Chok Young said he merely remarked casually,

"Wah, you would be in trouble" and surmised that the Plaintiff must have drawn

her own conclusion from that remark. Lim Chok Young said he meant that it was not going to

be easy to attend to so many matters in administering the estate, including the Petir Road

flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">146 In re-examination, Lim Chok Young

explained that he helped the deceased to buy the $400,000 or so worth of personal accident

insurance as he (Lim Chok Young) had read that the accident rate for elderly persons was

very high and had been shown statistics of accidents happening to the elderly and the very

high medical and living expenses. He would not want to send the deceased to an old

folks’ home if an accident should happen to the latter as he did social work by

visiting such homes and saw how difficult life was there. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">147 The deceased, although unemployed for

about six months in 1997, had some savings. He had also won the 4-D lottery at the end of

1996. Even if he could not afford to pay for the policies, Lim Chok Young would help him

pay. After his death, Lim Chok Young found about $5,000 to $6,000 in the Petir Road flat

together with some $1,000 in coins.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">148 He suggested to the deceased to buy

the Petir Road flat as prices were rising and he might not be able to afford one later. It

was more convenient for him to own a flat himself. Besides that, he could rent out one

bedroom and earn some income. If prices rose further, they could sell and share the

profits. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">149 He suggested the will to the deceased

as the HDB could repossess the Petir Road flat if the deceased passed away. After all,

they were only uncle and nephew.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">150 The deceased spoke in Hokkien to Lim

Chok Young, a Teochew. Lim Chok Young found it strange initially as the deceased was

supposed to be the youngest brother of his late father. He questioned the deceased about

this but he did not seem happy about it and so the matter was not pursued. That was over a

decade ago. He had never asked his mother about the deceased. Lim Chok Young had seen the

deceased at his late father’s funeral when he was four or five years old. He

remembered that the deceased loved him very much. They met again a few years later at a

dinner during the seventh lunar month. Lim Chok Young’s family was also at that

dinner. They met again in town a few years later when the deceased chided him for not

addressing him and mentioned Lim Chok Young’s father’s name. Ever since that

time, Lim Chok Young addressed the deceased as uncle. Lim Chok Young had never met the

other three of his father’s brothers. He did not know the Defendants’ two

additional witnesses who were claiming to be the relatives of the deceased. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">151 The Fourth Defendants’ insurance

forms (AB 39 and 40) could not be obtained unless one paid the premium for the policy. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">152 Lim Chok Young went on to explain why

he had thought the deceased was going to splash water on him when he opened the bathroom

door in the hotel in Cambodia that fateful day. He gave two previous instances where the

deceased played practical jokes on him during their trips.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">153 Lim Chok Young ended by expressing his

outrage at the malicious allegations of criminal conduct hurled at him in order to

"eat up" the insurance monies. The deceased and he were like father and son, he

had looked after the deceased for more than 10 years, helped him pay for the flat, brought

him on trips because "he wanted a taste of taking aeroplanes". "Why should

I want to murder him?" Lim Chok Young asked rhetorically. Further, GE Life had

investigated the claim and paid the full amount insured.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">154 In reply to my questions, Lim Chok

Young said that his relationship with the Plaintiff had deteriorated in the past because

he kept late nights and she wondered where he had gone to with the deceased. He tried

explaining to her but she did not listen. After the divorce petition was served on him, he

tried to make up but the Plaintiff avoided him and refused to talk to him. He then agreed

to the divorce with much regret thereafter. Not long after the divorce, their daughter

fell ill and they had to look after her and therefore began to communicate again. Their

relationship then improved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">155 For about a year or so after the

divorce, Lim Chok Young and the Plaintiff continued to share the bedroom in the Hougang

flat. The Woodlands flat was not ready and their daughter was schooling in Hougang. The

deceased would sleep in the other bedroom or in the living room of the Hougang flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">156 Towards the end of 1995, Lim Chok

Young bought the Yishun flat for $128,000 in the open market. The HDB permitted single

persons older than 35 to buy a three-room flat in the suburban areas. He sold it about two

and a half years later in July 1998 for $153,000. These HDB rules had been around for 10

years or so but he came to know about them only after the divorce when he was making

enquiries with the HDB during the transfer of the Hougang flat. He rented out one of the

two bedrooms of the Yishun flat for only three to five months at $450 per month. He had

decided to move out of the Hougang flat because it was not nice to meet the neighbours

after the divorce. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">157 Lim Chok Young said he shuttled

between the Yishun and the Woodlands flats. If the daughter was not attending school, he

would stay in the Woodlands flat. If she went to the Yishun flat after school, he would

stay in the Yishun flat. The daughter would stay in whichever flat an adult was present.

If Lim Chok Young went to fetch her from school, he would bring her to the Yishun flat

where she would stay overnight. When the Plaintiff, whose work ended late in the evening,

called and found that the daughter was at the Yishun flat, she would go there to sleep the

night.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">158 Despite the divorce, the two of them

were practically living together as husband and wife. They had slept in different bedrooms

soon after the divorce but resumed sleeping in the same room again thereafter. In fact, by

early 1995, they had resumed their sexual relationship.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">159 When the Plaintiff obtained possession

of the Woodlands flat, there were not many people in that area. Lim Chok Young was

therefore worried for her and for their daughter. After listening to his reasoning, the

Plaintiff gave him the keys to the Woodlands flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">160 Lim Chok Young was able to spend time

travelling with the jobless deceased although he was still working as he had accumulated

his "time offs" and had medical and annual leave entitlements. They paid for

their own trips but most of the time, Lim Chok Young would treat the deceased. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">161 For the Cambodian trip, they

originally intended to buy only one travel insurance policy worth $200,000. When they

realized that the country was not a safe place, they went to other tour agencies to buy

one or two more policies. $400,000 or thereabouts would have been sufficient cover for

them. They could not buy everything at one place because there was a fixed coverage for

this sort of insurance. Further, some agencies would sell only one policy per trip and

they therefore could not upgrade their cover from $200,000 to $400,000. Eventually, they

bought $800,000 worth because "the more we bought, the cheaper it became". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">162 Lim Chok Young and his family did not

travel with the deceased because it was more convenient and cost-effective to book only

one hotel room for the family.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">163 It was very hot in Cambodia. Lim Chok

Young would take a shower in the morning and bathe in the tub in the evening. The deceased

took one bath a day. He enjoyed bathing in the bath tub, making a lot of sounds in the

water and would take some time. On 2 June 1997, the deceased was tired and not feeling

well as he had no appetite for food for the past two or three days. He was, however, not

ill. Lim Chok Young suggested that he take his bath as he thought the deceased would feel

better after that. After the deceased turned the water on, he continued to talk to Lim

Chok Young as he wanted to finish smoking his cigarette before taking his bath. While his

movements were not fast, he had never fainted before. Lim Chok Young could not remember

whether the deceased also bathed in the tub on the other trips.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">164 I asked Lim Chok Young whether he had

ever moved out of the bedroom he shared with the Plaintiff while they were living in the

Hougang flat. This was because of what was alleged by the Plaintiff in her divorce

petition that he had since early 1993 moved into another room without her consent and

refused cohabitation. Lim Chok Young’s initial reply was "No". He then said

that occasionally, he would sleep in the other bedroom as he would switch on the lights

and take a shower when he came home and did not wish to disturb the Plaintiff and their

daughter who were sleeping in the room. He then added that he liked to sleep in a room by

himself while living in the Hougang flat as he did not like people to touch him. They were

sleeping in separate rooms for a few months before the divorce. In his next breath, the

few months became a few years before the divorce.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">165 After the divorce proceedings, which

took about half a year to conclude, Lim Chok Young realized that it was a serious matter

and decided to treat the Plaintiff better. Their relationship then got better.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">166 The next three witnesses for the

Plaintiff were the family members of Lim Chok Young, called to testify about the

relationship between the deceased and Lim Chok Young’s late father. Lim Chok

Young’s wheelchair bound mother, Chng Sok Choo, a housewife aged 74, testified that

she has four sons and an adopted daughter. She referred to some photographs of the

deceased and said that she recognized him as the sworn brother of her husband who passed

away more than 30 years ago. The first time she saw the deceased was when he came to visit

her husband at their home. Her husband told her the deceased was his sworn younger

brother. She learned that he was a casual labourer. The second time she saw the deceased

was when he attended the funeral wake of her husband. He also visited her a few years

later. Lim Chok Young had mentioned to her previously that the deceased was staying with

him. As she had difficulty walking, she never visited Lim Chok Young at his home.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">167 Lim Chok Young’s mother did not

know anything about her late husband’s brothers except that they were in China. She

could not recall how many there were or what their names were. Lim Chok Young told her

some time ago about the demise of the deceased. She could not recall whether she had told

Lim Chok Young that the deceased was his father’s sworn brother. She addressed the

deceased as "Bak Chang Chek" or "Uncle Dumpling" in Teochew as

instructed by her late husband.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">168 Lim Ah Choek, the elder brother of Lim

Chok Young, a businessman, testified that he had seen the deceased at their father’s

funeral wake about 34 years ago. Lim Ah Choek was 16 years old then. The deceased told him

that he was their father’s sworn brother. After that, he did not see the deceased for

many years. In 1991, he went to Lim Chok Young’s Hougang flat to deliver a used

television set to him. he was surprised to see the deceased alone in the flat. The

deceased told him that Lim Chok Young had gone out and that he was staying with him. Lim

Ah Choek placed the television set in the flat and then left.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">169 Sometime later, he asked Lim Chok

Young about the deceased staying with them as he was concerned about the Plaintiff’s

feelings. Lim Chok Young told him that the Plaintiff had no objections and was helping the

deceased with his laundry and his meals, that the deceased was kind-hearted and would not

cheat or take advantage of him. Having been thus reassured, Lim Ah Choek did not raise the

matter again. He has also not seen the deceased since then, even when he visited the

Hougang flat which was no more than once a year as he was a busy man. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">170 In cross-examination, Lim Chok

Young’s brother said he only knew the deceased was his uncle. He did not know the

deceased’s name and had never told Lim Chok Young that the deceased was the sworn

brother of their late father. Lim Chok Young told him over the telephone a few years ago

that their "sworn uncle" had passed away abroad. Asked whether Lim Chok Young

already knew at the time of the telephone conversation that the deceased was the sworn

brother of their late father, Lim Ah Choek said, "yes".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">171 The final witness for the Plaintiff

was Ng Guak Chuan, the adopted elder sister of Lim Chok Young, working as a cook in a food

court. Her surname was not Lim as she was adopted. About 12 years ago, on the first day of

Chinese New Year, she visited Lim Chok Young at the Hougang flat after visiting their

mother who also lived in Hougang Avenue 3. She remembered the year clearly because her

eldest daughter was 12 then and is now 22 years old. That was the one and only time she

visited Lim Chok Young at his Hougang flat. On that occasion, she saw a thin, old man

eating rice at the table. Lim Chok Young introduced him as their uncle, "Bak Chang

Chek". She has not met the deceased since then and neither did she visit Lim Chok

Young again.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">172 The adopted sister testified that she

would not be able to recognize the deceased now. When she was asked to be a witness, Lim

Chok Young and their mother mentioned the deceased’s name and Lim Chok Young reminded

her that she had met the deceased at his Hougang flat about 12 years ago. Although she did

not speak to the deceased then, she maintained that she did see him at the Hougang flat.

She attended the funeral wake of Lim Chok Young’s father but did not see the deceased

there then.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">173 Dr Gilbert Lau is the Director of

Forensic Pathology at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Institute of Science and

Forensic Medicine, Singapore. He has been practising forensic pathology since 1987. He was

asked to render an expert medical opinion on the cause(s) of death of the deceased and on

the conclusions of Dr Lek Se based on the documents issued by the Cambodian authorities

and on the preliminary report dated 29 July 1997 by the Defendants’ loss adjusters.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">174 In his opinion contained in a letter

dated 5 April 1999 to the Defendants’ solicitors, Dr Gilbert Lau stated that the

conclusion that the deceased had drowned in the bath tub, as a consequence of a fainting

spell, appeared to have been based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, the

strength of which he was unable to ascertain. He noted that the mere presence of water in

the stomach was not strictly diagnostic of drowning. In his view, such a case would

warrant a full autopsy, supplemented by a review of the deceased’s medical history

(particularly of previous fainting spells, heart disease and strokes), in order to exclude

the possibility that the deceased:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) died from natural causes such as a

  heart attack or a stroke prior to immersion in water. This was particularly important

  since the deceased was known to have been a heavy cigarette smoker;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) died from a combination of drowning

  and some underlying disease or abnormality;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) drowned accidentally, irrespective of

  any putative, pre-existing, natural disease; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) was a victim of homicide.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Gilbert Lau concluded his opinion by

stating that he would not be able to gain access to the deceased’s past medical

history as the death did not occur in Singapore and was therefore not reported to the

Coroner. Further, he doubted that a trip by him to Cambodia would serve any useful

purpose.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">175 In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief,

Dr Gilbert Lau elaborated on his opinion that it was not possible to diagnose drowning as

the definitive cause or sole cause of death from only an external examination of the body.

He referred to various medical literature to support his view that it was not possible to

conclude that drowning, either as a result of syncope or fainting or otherwise, was the

cause of death merely from an observation that there was water in the deceased’s

stomach. He elaborated that homicide included poisoning or drugging the deceased prior to

immersion in water and also holding him underwater.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">176 An autopsy would involve a

comprehensive external and internal post-mortem examination of the body, thus avoiding

conjecture. In a case of suspected drowning, particular emphasis would be placed on

establishing the presence of froth or water in the airways and the lungs. A detailed and

careful autopsy would also be indispensable in excluding the presence of fatal or serious

internal injuries, particularly of the head, neck and abdomen, which may not be visible

externally. Only then can the possibility of foul play or homicide be ruled out. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">177 If no gross pathology (i.e. any

abnormality visible to the naked eye) was found, ancillary investigations such as the

histological (microscopic) examination of relevant tissue specimens, especially of the

heart and the lungs, would be necessary to exclude the possibility that the deceased died

from natural causes or disease or a combination of drowning and some underlying disease.

Further, toxicological analyses of the deceased’s blood sample and other body fluid

and tissue specimens such as urine, bile, gastric contents, vitreous humour and liver

tissue, were necessary to exclude the possibility of poisoning, intoxication or drug

overdose. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">178 Having heard the evidence of the three

witnesses from Cambodia, Dr Gilbert Lau maintained his opinions, based on his training and

experience in Singapore and in the United Kingdom.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">179 In cross-examination, Dr Gilbert Lau

testified that he would also study the surroundings at a scene of death particularly if

the death was a suspicious one. He was rarely shown statements made by witnesses to the

police and, if shown such statements, would ignore them anyway so that his professional

opinion would not be affected. He referred to the report of the loss adjusters for the

relevant aspects pertaining to the circumstances of death and not for the quantum of the

claim. In fact, he did not accord much weight to it as it contained very little forensic

or medical information.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">180 In Singapore, all unnatural death

cases, which would include drowning, were subject to autopsy. That was also the practice

in Britain. In other countries, an autopsy would not necessarily be done for unnatural

death cases. It would not be unreasonable to conclude that the deceased might have drowned

in this case but one could not ascertain this without an autopsy. If autopsy facilities

were unavailable, then the cause of death should have been left as unascertained. In his

opinion, a forensic practitioner must, in all circumstances, arrive at his conclusion

independently of any committee. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">181 Dr Gilbert Lau was unable to say that

it would not be wrong for Dr Lek Se to make the assessment of drowning in the

circumstances. If Dr Lek Se had said there was copious foam coming out from the nose and

the mouth of the deceased, he would have given more credence to the diagnosis of drowning

based purely on an external examination, provided that the possibility of mechanical

asphyxia had been excluded and that, in turn, would require an autopsy. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">182 There was a difference of medical

opinion as to the significance of the presence of water in the stomach. Some believed

little weight could be attached to that fact, others held that as a sign that the person

was alive when he entered the water. Entry of water into the airways and subsequently the

lungs could occur passively but it would not result in a thick formation of foam as in a

classical case of drowning. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">183 Most poisons and drugs would not

produce external diagnostic changes. Hence the importance of a toxicological analysis. If

the deceased had been poisoned and died before being put into the water, whether or not

any froth was found at the mouth would depend on whether or not there was water in the

lungs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">184 Bruises might occur in the deeper

tissues of the body that would not be visible to the naked eye initially. Severe internal

bruising occurring without external signs was possible. That is why forensic pathologists

here would examine the body again after the autopsy was done and the organs removed. What

Dr Lek Se had done was to do a second external examination of a body which would have

begun to decompose in the hot weather and that would not be of much value. Dr Lek

Se’s opinion was inconclusive based on very tenuous evidence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">185 The Defendants’ second witness

was Chan Hwee Seng, the Managing Director of Crawford and Co. International Pte Ltd, the

loss adjusters appointed by the Defendants on or about 13 June 1997 to investigate the

claims lodged by the Plaintiff. He interviewed Lim Chok Young on 30 June 1997, 14 July

1997 and 19 July 1997. Lim Chok Young’s statements made at the interviews were taken

down in writing and signed by him (Lim Chok Young).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">186 Chan went to Cambodia on 3 July 1997

to look at room 505 of the Pailin Hotel. He interviewed the two chambermaids who were at

the scene when the incident occurred on 2 June 1997, the General Manager of the hotel and

the salesgirl at the photo studio across the road. The results of his investigations were

set out in a Preliminary Report dated 29 July 1997, in which he concluded that the

Plaintiff’s claim was suspicious and stated that his enquiries were by no means

complete. A summary from Lim Chok Young’s passport showed that he had made numerous

short trips of one to two days duration to Malaysia and Indonesia between 1988 and 1997,

with many of the trips occurring between January and May 1997 (both months included). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">187 The following were some of the salient

points made by Lim Chok Young in his statements:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) "We moved into our present

  address at Blk 891B Woodland Drive #04-183 which I bought for $130,000. I was residing at

  Blk 252 Hougang Ave 3 #09-340."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) "In 1996, we moved to the new

  house at (the Woodlands flat)."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) "It was my idea to sublet the

  unit at (the Petir Road flat). The master bedroom was leased to a couple at $600 per

  month. In fact, initially, we leased the whole unit to the couple. However, after protest

  from HDB, we decided to lease the unit partially."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) "The monthly instalment of (the

  Petir Road flat) is $540 per month for 25 years. My uncle, Lim Mah Chan, stopped work

  about half year ago. He was a heavy smoker and occasionally he requested allowance from

  us. We gave him about $100.00 or less. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… He strike lottery when he initially

  moved into the new unit at Petir Road."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(5) "After some thought, I think my

  uncle, Mr Lim Mah Chan, had purchased too many travel insurances. Without my suggestion

  and influence, he will not have bought four travel insurances."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(6) "My uncle, Mr Lim Mah Chan, led a

  care-free life style."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">188 In cross-examination, Chan Hwee Seng

explained that when he travelled to Cambodia on 3 July 1997 Wednesday, he had meant to

stay until Saturday but decided to leave the country on Friday because of the unstable

political situation. Although he tried to get in touch with the members of the Cambodian

Investigation Committee, he was not able to meet them. He took notes of his interviews

with the two chambermaids whom he met separately, with the hotel’s general manager

acting as interpreter. He did not arrange to have them brought to Singapore for the trial

although he had their particulars.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">189 Chan agreed that the smooth floor

tiles in the toilet of the hotel room in question would be slippery when wet. The hotel

had central airconditiioning. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">190 He did not check whether a full

autopsy could be performed in Phnom Penh and neither did he enquire about the cost and the

procedure of bringing the body back to Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">191 He has since done some follow-up work

by checking with the clinics in the neighbourhood where the deceased lived to see if the

deceased had been there because of any illness. No positive results were obtained. He has

also gone to Woodlands to check with the neighbours on the relationship between Lim Chok

Young and the Plaintiff but no one was prepared to come forward to say anything.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">192 At the interviews with Lim Chok Young,

Chan found him cooperative and very forthright in answering his questions. He spoke to Lim

Chok Young in Mandarin.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">193 The loss adjusters wrote to the CID on

12 August 1997 attaching a copy of the said Preliminary Report to see if the matter should

be referred to the police for further investigation. On 29 August 1997, the CID met the

representative of the loss adjusters and then replied that they had carefully studied the

Report and found that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate any criminal offence

being committed and that the CID would not be taking any further action in the matter.

However, should the loss adjusters have any further information or evidence indicating any

offence having been committed, they were invited to forward them to the CID for

consideration.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">194 Dr Lum Foong Poon, a medical

practitioner having his own clinic, testified that he was an accredited medical examiner

for various insurance companies in Singapore, among them AIA. The medical records and the

Application for Life Insurance – Statement to the Medical Examiner Form filled up by

him on 1 October 1996 showed that he examined the deceased for an insurance application.

The doctor made the following findings in respect of the deceased after the examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) he was suffering or had suffered from

  syphilis;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) he suffered from bilateral cataracts,

  with visual acuity at 6/60 uncorrected for both eyes, indicating very poor eyesight;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) he suffered from skin infection on the

  right forearm probably due to poor hygiene and to scratching;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) he tested positive for blood in his

  urine, suggesting bleeding from the genito-urinary system, and also had traces of glucose

  in his urine;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(5) he was found to have a dropped beat in

  every three to five beats, indicating irregular heartbeats in the sense that there was a

  pause in every three to five beats. Such pause was due to the occurrence of an abnormal

  premature heart beat followed by a compensatory pause. It could occur in a normal person

  and its incidence increased with age. It could be related to over-indulgence in tobacco,

  coffee or alcohol. It could also occur in a person suffering from heart disease.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">195 Dr Lum went on to say that he would

normally inform his patients of the positive findings he made. The results of blood tests

would be ready only after a few days. If there were positive results or unfavourable

findings from such tests, he would telephone his patients to inform them and to ask them

to return for further evaluation or follow up treatment. He was sure he called the

deceased but whether the latter made an appointment or not, he was not certain. There were

no subsequent records indicating that the deceased returned to the clinic. He had the

deceased’s telephone number stated as 7593981 and his address as the Woodlands flat.

He noted in the form that the deceased was slow in responding to questions, probably due

to his low mentality. He also noted that the deceased behaved older than his age of 60

years. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">196 Dr Lum could not remember the language

he spoke to the deceased in. Physically, the deceased did not look like he was in poor

health. There were no signs indicating active syphilis. Nowadays, the third or tertiary

stage, i.e. the worst stage for syphilis, was very rare. That would be when the syphilis

became life-threatening. In his opinion, the deceased was probably at the stage between

the second/secondary and third/tertiary stages during which there would be no symptoms or

signs at all. It was also possible that he had already been treated. His heart was normal.

No further test was conducted to determine the cause of the blood in the urine because the

insurance company did not so instruct and neither did the deceased return for follow-up

action. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">197 The medical report was not sent to the

deceased as there was a confidentiality clause protecting against such disclosure. As such

insurance check-up cases were one-off patients, Dr Lum did not keep a case note like he

would for other patients.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">198 Florence Lim Tuan Lien, the Chief

Underwriting Manager of AIA, testified that the application for insurance form dated 1

October 1996 of the deceased showed that he was a self-employed trishaw rider while the

Application for Life Insurance – Statement to the Medical Examiner Form of the same

date stated that he was retired. Both had the thumbprint of the deceased. Based on the

medical findings and Dr Lum’s comment, the insurance company decided to reject the

deceased’s application for insurance on 17 October 1996. His deposit of $782.40 for

the payment of premiums was refunded to him by a cheque dated 21 October 1996. The

deceased was notified by a letter dated 21 October 1996 addressed to the Woodlands flat

indicating that his application was not accepted on account of "Physical

History".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">199 Florence Lim clarified under

cross-examination that the letter and the cheque both dated 21 October 1996 were sent to

the agent for her to forward to the applicant. She was not able to confirm whether the

said cheque was presented for payment. She never met the deceased and had no knowledge of

the circumstances in which the application for insurance was filled up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">200 Sim Chye Huat, aged 55, was one of the

two witnesses who approached the Defendants’ solicitors during the trial. He

testified that he had known the deceased since he (Sim) was a little boy. The deceased

used to live at No. 1, Farquhar Street while Sim lived next door at No. 2. Sim’s

sister (now deceased) married Lim Boon Chok who was the deceased’s elder brother. Sim

and the deceased, while they were neighbours in Farquhar Street, used to meet very

regularly. Sim also produced photographs which showed the deceased was at Sim’s

wedding on 26 December 1987.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">201 The deceased did not have a brother

named Lim Ah Khoon (Lim Chok Young’s late father) and neither did he have a nephew

called Lim Chok Young. The deceased also never had a sworn brother or a god-daughter. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">202 After the buildings along Farquhar

Street were demolished sometime at the end of 1995, the deceased went to stay at the

business premises (Lian Yick Tables and Chairs) of one of the Lim clan members in Defu

Lane for a few months. Sim had not heard from or seen the deceased since that time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">203 The next time he heard about the

deceased was in early 1997 when the Chinese newspapers reported that an old man had gone

to Haadyai, lost his passport and was found wondering in the streets there without any

money. Sim was told that the deceased was allowed to stay in the Oriental Hotel there for

a few days and, because he was carrying a name card of Lian Yick Tables and Chairs, the

manager of the hotel managed to call the said Singapore business and arrange the

deceased’s transportation home.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">204 The next occasion Sim heard about the

deceased was when he read the report about his death and the present trial in the Chinese

newspapers of 17 July 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">205 The deceased was a man of low

mentality, very trusting and gullible. He remained single and had never held a steady job.

He had worked previously as a trishaw rider. He would be short of money frequently and

would even go hungry for a few days. He would then approach Sim for some money. Sim

concluded by saying that, as a relative of the deceased, he was unhappy and angry that

someone was passing himself off as the deceased’s nephew.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">206 In cross-examination, Sim explained

that after his marriage on 26 December 1987, he moved out of No. 2 Farquhar Street. He

stayed in his brother’s flat in Serangoon and since 1997, has been living in Jurong

West St. 81. Even after moving out of Farquhar Street, he kept in frequent contact with

the deceased. The deceased was then a trishaw rider ferrying tourists to Serangoon Road.

He would also help out at the funeral wakes of relatives as he would be given "ang

pows". Sim would give him $10 for food each time they met. Most of the

deceased’s clansmen had already moved out of No. 1 Farquhar Street by then. The

deceased was occupying the second level of that location which was essentially a

coolies’ hostel.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">207 At the end of 1995 to early 1996, the

premises at Farquhar Street were acquired for re-development and were demolished. As the

deceased had nowhere to stay after the demolition, Sim sent him to his relatives at Lian

Yick Tables and Chairs. When they moved there, the deceased had only two packets of

belongings to bring along. The deceased did not inform Sim before 1995 that he was living

in Hougang, Yishun or Woodlands.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">208 Sim reiterated that the deceased was

not a smart person. People nicknamed him "Suku Bak Chang" or "Stupid Meat

Dumpling" (apparently a word play on the deceased’s name). The deceased would

not scold or beat up people and would not steal. He was basically an honest man although a

little greedy because he would buy food for others if given the excess small change. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">209 Although Sim seldom talked to the

deceased, he was certain that he did not have a sworn brother or a god-daughter as the

deceased had never mentioned such to Sim. The deceased also had no close friends. After

Sim’s marriage, he would visit the deceased every Saturday afternoon after his work

and on Sundays at Farquhar Street. Sim was sure the deceased was residing there until

end-1995 or early 1996.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">210 After sending the deceased to his new

home in the Defu Lane premises at the end of 1995 or early 1996, Sim did not meet the

deceased again as he was very busy with his work. He gave the deceased $100 for his living

expenses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">211 About a month later, the

deceased’s relative who owned the Defu Lane premises telephoned Sim to inform him

that the deceased had a friend living in Yishun who wanted him to stay with him and who

would help the deceased to find some work. That relative did not know the address or

contact number of the said friend of the deceased. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">212 Sim thought that the said friend must

be up to no good since the deceased was old, jobless and penniless and had skin problems

and poor eyesight. However, he was very busy and was very grateful to that person as it

would save Sim a lot of money. When Sim met the deceased’s said relative again, Sim

asked him about the deceased but he did not have any information. Even after the deceased

was brought back to Singapore from Thailand on the occasion where he lost his passport,

neither Sim nor that relative knew where the deceased was staying. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">213 Sim added in re-examination that the

deceased was not one who knew how to plan or save money for his future. So long as he had

tens of dollars, he would not want to work. He never had any savings account during the

time Sim was in contact with him. The deceased never spoke about marriage or starting a

family as he could not even support himself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">214 Lim Kim Poh, a retiree aged 62, was

the final witness for the Defendants. She testified that the deceased, who was older than

her by about two years, was adopted by her parents when he was a baby. She had only one

other brother called Lim Boon Chok. Both her parents died decades ago.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">215 When her only other brother, Lim Boon

Chok, died in 1998, no obituary was published. However, when Lim Boon Chok’s wife

died in January 1992, there was an obituary in the Chinese newspapers. Lim Kim Poh

produced a copy of the obituary which showed the deceased listed as the subject’s

brother-in-law.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">216 Lim Kim Poh went on to state that she

and the deceased grew up together and were close to each other. He would tell her things

and confide in her. However, he had never mentioned any sworn brother or any god-daughter,

something he would certainly have told his sister. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">217 In her assessment, the deceased was

someone of low mentality who could not even count money properly and did not know how to

use a telephone. He was a very trusting person. He remained single and never had a steady

job although he used to work as a trishaw rider. He was always short of money. At times,

he would go hungry for days, drinking only tap water. He would go to see Lim Kim Poh who

would give him a few dollars and also some milk to drink. He loved Guinness Stout and

smoking.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">218 The last time she saw the deceased was

at the funeral wake of her sister-in-law in January 1992. A few years ago, she received a

call from a lady telling her that the deceased wished to speak to her. The telephone was

then passed to the deceased who told his sister that he was staying in Yishun and that

someone was providing him with food. When she asked him why he was not working, he replied

that he was not able to because of his cataracts. Like Sim Chye Huat, she concluded her

Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief by stating that she was unhappy and angry that someone was

passing himself off as the deceased’s nephew. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">219 In cross-examination, Lim Kim Poh said

she married in 1955 and moved out of the family home at No. 1 Farquhar Street. After she

moved into a HDB flat in 1977, the deceased visited her a few times a year but she did not

visit him. His last visit should be before the aforesaid funeral wake in January 1992.

Like everyone else, she called the deceased "Suku Bak Chang". Prior to that last

meeting in 1992, the deceased was living in Farquhar Street. She knew that as a fact

because she had many relatives who lived there. She could not invite the deceased to live

with her as her flat was a small one. She did not know whether the deceased was staying in

Hougang in late 1992.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">220 When the deceased telephoned her a few

years back to tell her he was living in Yishun and that a couple was housing and looking

after him, she thought that there were many kind people nowadays who would take care of

the elderly. When she asked for his address in Yishun, he was not able to tell her and so

she did not go to look for him. The deceased must have obtained her telephone number from

her husband from whom she was separated.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">221 The burden of proof is on the

Plaintiff here to establish that the insured peril occurred and that the deceased died

from accidental drowning. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">222 As indicated earlier, there were three

policies taken out in the name of the deceased with the Second Defendants. The Personal

Accident Insurance Policy issued on 22 January 1996 for one year and renewed until 21

January 1998 insured the deceased for $20,000 in the event of death. The scope of cover

included "… bodily injury caused by violent accidental external and visible

means which is the sole cause of death …". The Life Assurance Policy issued on

25 January 1996 insured the deceased for 25 years for $7,000 in the event of death. The

Travel Insurance for $200,000 covered "… bodily injury caused by violent,

accidental, external and visible means which is the sole cause of death …".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">223 The First Defendants’ travel

insurance policy covered death "caused by an accident, solely and independently of

any other cause". The Third Defendants’ policy covered death caused solely and

directly by accidental means excluding any sickness, disease or medical disorder. The

insured peril in the Fourth Defendants’ policy was death "caused by violent,

accidental, external and visible means". The Fifth Defendants’ policy covered

death caused by the sustaining of accidental bodily injury by the deceased. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">224 With the greatest of respect for the

Cambodian Investigation Committee, although the course of action taken by them was

probably justifiable and acceptable according to their prevailing practice and in the

light of the circumstances then known to them, their finding that the deceased "was

really dead of fainting spell and drowning in the bath tub" could not be one that was

conclusive on the cause of death. Although they did conduct an external examination of the

body and studied the surroundings, they probably placed rather too much faith in the

statements made by Lim Chok Young. I accept Dr Gilbert Lau’s expert evidence that, in

the absence of an autopsy, the cause of death could not really be ascertained. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">225 Even if the cause of death was

drowning, it would not be possible to conclude with any reasonable degree of confidence

that the deceased had somehow fainted while getting into the bath tub that was being

filled with water. The deceased was facing downwards in the bath tub with his right arm at

his back. Even if we ignore the recent minor injuries at the right wrist, the position of

the right arm would be quite unnatural for someone stepping into a bath tub, fainting and

then falling forwards into the water. Even if the deceased had regained some consciousness

and was struggling to get back on his feet, it would still be highly improbable that he

was trying to do so by moving his right arm to his back.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">226 The absence of signs of forced entry

and of struggle in the hotel room could indicate that there was no forced intrusion into

and no struggle in the room. It could not however eliminate the real possibility that an

assailant had access to the room (whether by possessing a key to the room door or by

entering through the possibly unlocked room door). It could not also eliminate the real

possibility that an assailant had surprised the deceased or was known to the deceased so

that there would be minimal struggle. Considering the size and the reported weak state

that the deceased was in prior to his death, there would be little cause for violent

struggle anyway. Even if a struggle did take place, it would not have been too difficult

to clean up the scene thereafter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">227 It was also evident that the use of

drugs or poison on the deceased could not be ruled out simply by an external examination

of the body at the scene followed by another at the temple a couple of hours later. The

absence of drugs or poison in the hotel room or its surroundings could at best indicate

that the deceased did not possess and use such. It could not rule out the possibility that

some drug or poison was administered to the deceased and the implements subsequently

disposed of. One could not tell whether the deceased was rendered unconscious or had died

from such and was then placed in the bath tub or was rendered so weak that holding his

head below the water level became easier than trying to keep a plastic ball below water. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">228 The Investigation Committee’s

finding that the deceased had fainted, then drowned was also fraught with difficulty. The

deceased did not appear to have been in poor health before he left for the Cambodian

holiday. The flight to Cambodia could not have been a long one. He arrived on 30 May 1997,

joined the group in the tour of the city on 31 May 1997 and rested on 1 June 1997. Even if

he was tired, he was apparently well enough to take baths in the bath tub on 31 May 1997

and 1 June 1997, making happy noises in the water at the same time. On 2 June 1997, he was

also resting in the fully airconditioned hotel after having had his breakfast, light

though it might have been. Even if his appetite was poor and the incident happened at

close to lunch time, this was a man accustomed to hunger. He did not leave the hotel at

all on 2 June 1997 and therefore could not have been affected by any heat wave outside. He

was chatting and watching television in the room with Lim Chok Young for about three

hours. He must have been well for Lim Chok Young to suggest that he take a bath in the

bath tub and then go for lunch three and a half hours after breakfast. He was even smoking

a cigarette while waiting for the tub to be filled with water. In those circumstances, it

seems to me highly speculative to conclude that the deceased had a fainting spell. In

fairness to the Investigation Committee, they did not have the advantage of the fuller

picture that emerged in the course of the trial.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">229 It was therefore not possible to rely

on the Investigation Committee’s findings to conclude that death was by drowning and

that it was accidental. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">230 I now come to the testimony of the

Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young. It is clear to me that their divorce in 1994 was nothing

more than a sham. They never ceased to live together as husband and wife even if the

official records such as their Identity Cards showed them to have different addresses. The

only reason the Plaintiff was confused in her testimony about where she was living after

her divorce was because her evidence was concocted and utterly false.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">231 Earlier on in this judgment (at

paragraph 84,), I set out the particulars given by her in her divorce petition. Lim Chok

Young was said to have "neglected the family and never showed any love and

concern" for the Plaintiff and their daughter "throughout the marriage".

They married on 6 February 1979. The Petition was filed on 23 May 1994, more than 15 years

later. Their daughter was born on 16 November 1986, about seven and a half years before

the filing of the Petition. Lim Chok Young was also said to have behaved very coldly

towards the Plaintiff since early 1993 and had in fact moved into the other bedroom and

refused cohabitation. Throughout the seven months between the filing of the Petition and

the Decree Absolute, Lim Chok Young said in Court, he was trying to reconcile with the

Plaintiff but to no avail. However, the Plaintiff, who affirmed in her Petition that she

"cannot reasonably be expected to live with" Lim Chok Young nevertheless

continued to live with him even after the Decree Absolute and barely a few months later,

resumed a sexual relationship with him. Immediately after the divorce, Lim Chok Young

suddenly transformed into a loving father towards the daughter for whom he "never

showed any love and concern" for some seven to eight years. Why should a man like

that be so shaken by the divorce that he became a changed man almost immediately?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">232 The charade was made even clearer by

the Consent Order relating to the division of the matrimonial home. If the family and

household expenses were borne by the Plaintiff, who was not earning a substantial salary

and who would be buying the five-room Woodlands flat on her own, it was indeed surprising

that the Plaintiff was quite contented to have only her CPF contributions and accrued

interest back, leaving the erstwhile irresponsible husband and father to benefit from the

enhanced value of the Hougang flat (which left him with enough excess cash to make the

downpayment for the deceased’s Petir Road flat – but more about that later).

Further, why then was there a joint account with the POSB which, according to the

Plaintiff, was used by Lim Chok Young all those years to pay the utility bills for the

Hougang flat?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">233 If the Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young

had practically reconciled by early 1995 (after their divorce in 1994), why was there a

need for Lim Chok Young to purchase another three-room flat in Yishun? He could have

easily moved to the Woodlands flat with his family – after all, the new flat had

three bedrooms. There could also be no question of Lim Chok Young having to shift out of

the Hougang flat because he felt bashful about meeting the Hougang neighbours after the

divorce since Lim Chok Young and the Plaintiff continued to live as husband and wife in

the Hougang flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">234 Lim Chok Young’s failure to

maintain his family since the marriage did not sit well at all with the couple’s

otherwise touching story of how they took pity on an elderly relative whom Lim Chok Young

had not seen for years and provided him with food, lodging and living expenses. It was

also a glaring omission that no mention of the deceased was made at all in the Petition

when he was allegedly one of the main reasons why Lim Chok Young did not spend time with

the Plaintiff and began to ignore her altogether. Further, despite their professed new

religious belief and their reconciliation, Lim Chok Young appeared to be carrying on the

very same "like father and son" relationship with the deceased that had

contributed to the marital break up, spending a lot of time with him and leaving together

for trips abroad in 1997 without even informing the Plaintiff!</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">235 When the Plaintiff took possession of

the Woodlands flat in late 1995 or so, one of her first acts was to give a duplicate key

to the flat to Lim Chok Young for the purpose of enabling him to visit their daughter. If

their daughter was in the Woodlands flat, why was there a need for Lim Chok Young to have

the door key? If she was at school, why was Lim Chok Young given such free access to the

Woodlands flat? If the purpose was to enable Lim Chok Young to buy food and to take care

of their daughter, as the Plaintiff always appeared to be very busy at work while Lim Chok

Young seemed to have so much time on his hands, it was bizarre that Lim Chok Young

reverted to his old, irresponsible ways in 1997 by going abroad for days without even

telling the Plaintiff so that she could make alternative arrangements for their beloved

daughter. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">236 If further evidence of the sham

divorce is required, it is found in the statements made by Lim Chok Young to the loss

adjusters (see paragraph 187 of this judgment). I repeat them here emphasizing the very

telling evidence in italics:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"<i>We</i> moved into <i>our</i>

  present address at (the Woodlands flat) which <i>I</i> bought for $130,000. I was residing

  at (the Hougang flat)."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In 1996, <i>we</i> moved to the new

  house at (the Woodlands flat)."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Do the above statements not support the

clear position that the family never ceased to live together and that they treated the

Woodlands flat as their new home? The couple was never put asunder and there is therefore

no question of their religious belief putting them back together.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">237 The next question to ask must be, why

did they go through the charade of a divorce? The answer is simple – money. Under HDB

regulations, the Plaintiff, with the daughter in her custody, was eligible to buy a flat.

Lim Chok Young, single after the divorce, was above 35 years in age and could purchase a

three-room flat on his own account. He knew that these regulations were in existence for

years and yet pretended to have learned about them only after the divorce. Obviously, one

of the rooms in the Yishun flat was rented out to earn income for Lim Chok Young with the

other room probably used to house the deceased at some point in time. After two and a half

years of possession, Lim Chok Young would be able to sell the Yishun flat, hopefully for

the same huge profits that he made from the capital gain on his Hougang flat. I take

judicial notice of the fact that prices for all sorts of real property were in an upswing

in 1993 and 1994. That was why they decided to "divorce" in 1994. Unfortunately

for Lim Chok Young, property prices did not continue their upward swing after 1996 and he

was lucky to be able to sell the Yishun flat (after the requisite two and a half years of

possession) with some profit. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">238 The Petir Road flat was acquired by

Lim Chok Young in the name of the deceased for the same motives – to earn rental

income for two and a half years and then sell at a profit. The deceased, like Lim Chok

Young, met the same eligibility criteria. I accept as a fact that the deceased would never

have thought of purchasing a flat on his own. He did not have any savings, was unemployed

and was not one given to planning for his future. He could never have afforded the luxury

of owning a flat. The Petir Road flat was, for all intents and purposes, the property of

Lim Chok Young who was astute enough to protect his investment by causing the deceased to

make the will in February 1997, leaving all his earthly possessions to the Plaintiff.

Again, the deceased was not someone who would have known what a will was, much less

thought about it and then decided to go to town to see a lawyer. The fact that Lim Chok

Young was willing to have the will name the Plaintiff as the sole beneficiary underlined

once again the obvious truth – they were never truly divorced. I revert again to

paragraph 187 of this judgment where I set out the statements made by Lim Chok Young to

the loss adjusters concerning the Petir Road flat. They showed clearly that he was the

brains behind the acquisition of the Petir Road flat and its use. Due to circumstances

beyond his control, this flat did not turn out to be a money-spinning venture for him.

Property prices had dipped or were at best stabilising in 1998 and 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">239 What sort of persons therefore are the

Plaintiff and her principal witness, Lim Chok Young? They are a couple who were willing to

go to Court with patently false particulars in the Divorce Petition in order to obtain a

sham divorce for financial gain. Lim Chok Young has demonstrated his acumen in money

matters. It is in this light that I must now examine their testimony about the deceased

and the insurance policies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">240 Firstly, I am willing to accept that

the deceased could have been the sworn brother of Lim Chok Young’s late father at

some point in time and that he could have regarded the Plaintiff as his god-daughter.

However, I could not accept the assertions that the deceased was with Lim Chok Young and

the Plaintiff since the late 1980s or that Lim Chok Young had always believed that the

deceased was related to him by blood. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">241 As stated earlier, the deceased did

not feature in the Divorce Petition filed in 1994 although it was said in Court that his

close relationship with Lim Chok Young was one of the main reasons for the marital break

up. I accept the testimony of Sim Chye Huat that the deceased was living in Farquhar

Street until about end-1995 when he helped the deceased move to Lian Yick Tables and

Chairs in Defu Lane. The Defu Lane industrial estate is practically next door to Lim Chok

Young’s Hougang flat in Block 252 Hougang Avenue 3. That must be about the time Lim

Chok Young came into contact with the deceased. By 1996, Lim Chok Young had the Yishun

flat and he could house the deceased in one of the rooms there. This would also be

entirely consistent with Lim Kim Poh’s evidence that the deceased had called her a

few years ago to say that he was staying with someone in Yishun. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">242 The evidence of Ng Guak Chuan (the

adopted sister of Lim Chok Young) appeared to me to be contrived. The name of the deceased

and the date of her visit to Lim Chok Young’s Hougang flat were obviously planted in

her evidence for her. She could not even remember what the deceased looked like or what

his name was without having been prompted by Lim Chok Young and his mother. Having paid

little attention to "this uncle" and not having visited Lim Chok Young ever

again, it was amazing that she could recall "a thin-looking old man eating rice at

the table" twelve years later. She could not even explain the hopelessly inconsistent

statements in her evidence where she recalled the incident as the first day of Chinese New

Year 12 years ago and then claimed that she "remembered the year clearly"

because her eldest daughter who was 12 years old then is now 22 years old, a difference of

10 and not 12 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">243 Similarly, Lim Chok Young’s

brother’s evidence centred on one single incident about nine years ago when he

allegedly met the deceased alone in the Hougang flat. I have serious doubts that such an

incident could have been ingrained so deeply in his memory when he did not talk to Lim

Chok Young about it again all these years. It was strange that he never met the deceased

again since that occasion even if he visited only once a year and it was incredible that

he did not even ask about the uncle ever again. More fundamentally, Lim Chok Young’s

brother was 16 when he last saw the deceased 34 years ago at his father’s funeral.

The deceased would have been 30 years old then. By 1991, when he next saw the deceased,

the deceased would have been about 55 years old. It was simply incredible that the brother

could recognize the deceased immediately after all those years. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">244 Lim Chok Young’s mother’s

evidence did not really assist the Plaintiff or Lim Chok Young. Even if Lim Chok Young did

mention to her that the deceased was staying with him, she could not remember when that

was. It was unlikely to have been during the time Lim Chok Young was living in the Hougang

flat as he would in all probability have brought the deceased to visit his wheelchair

bound mother who was also living in Hougang Avenue 3 if the deceased had already been

living in the Hougang flat for several years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">245 Therefore the most probable scenario

was that Lim Chok Young met the deceased sometime in late 1995 or early 1996 and

subsequently allowed him to stay in one of the two bedrooms in the Yishun flat (which Lim

Chok Young did not require as he was living in the Woodlands flat with the Plaintiff and

their daughter). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">246 If the deceased did regard the

Plaintiff as his god-daughter at some point in time, that was surely something suggested

to him by Lim Chok Young for his sinister plans later. The Plaintiff could not have been

close to the deceased at all. She was apparently too busy to take care of her

daughter’s meals, much less the deceased’s while he was alive. The deceased was

allegedly coming and going, even travelling out of the country, without so much as a

whimper to the Plaintiff about his plans. The two men did not even seem to bother to ask

the Plaintiff and her daughter whether they wished to go on some of the trips. The

deceased allegedly wanted the Plaintiff to take care of him for the remaining years of his

life but did not even tell the Plaintiff about his insurance policies and his will or

where he had kept them. When Lim Chok Young returned from Cambodia a few days after the

tragic incident with the remains of the deceased, the Plaintiff was too busy with her work

to even accompany Lim Chok Young to lay the remains to rest!</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">247 Lim Chok Young could not have believed

that the deceased, who was Hokkien, was the blood brother of his father, a Teochew. His

explanation that the deceased did not seem happy to discuss this matter was nothing more

than a lame excuse to gloss over the obvious. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">248 I find that the five travel insurance

policies in question in this trial were all applied for by Lim Chok Young, with or without

the presence of the deceased. The deceased was obviously an uneducated and happy-go-lucky

man whose furthest thoughts about the future were probably his next meal and his next

cigarette. He simply had no savings to splash on insurance-shopping or on tours. Insurance

was already something so foreign to him, what more $1.2 million worth just before a

five-day trip to Cambodia! I have no hesitation in rejecting Lim Chok Young’s

assertions that the deceased was converted to his deep abiding faith in insurance and that

the deceased fortuitously came into lottery money just before he became unemployed. The

truth of the matter was that the deceased was never gainfully employed for any appreciable

period of time due to his poor eyesight, low intellect and generally carefree approach to

life. Getting the deceased’s thumbprint or his handwritten name on application forms

for insurance would have been as easy as getting the deceased to light up a cigarette. As

was evident from Lim Chok Young’s own testimony, the insured did not even need to be

present at the agencies. All the premiums were paid by Lim Chok Young who needed no

reimbursement as the policies were his idea anyway and they were small change compared to

what he hoped to reap in the subsequent insurance claims.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">249 It was absurd that such a staunch

believer in insurance as Lim Chok Young was able to go around town leisurely amassing

insured sums for the deceased, right up to three days before departure on the tour, but

would forget the contact cards of the insurance companies when packing. He seemed to have

so much free time buzzing in and out of tour agencies in town. One wonders how long he

needed to pack for that short trip anyway. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">250 According to the Plaintiff and Lim

Chok Young, by early 1997, they were a couple experiencing a second spring of love. Lim

Chok Young’s former cold front must have melted in the warmth of their renewed love.

Yet the Plaintiff would have everyone believe that Lim Chok Young and the deceased were

carrying on as before, surreptitiously planning trips abroad and disappearing for days

without so much as a little note on the refrigerator door to inform the Plaintiff of their

whereabouts. I find her evidence on this utterly unbelievable. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">251 The evidence of Lim Chok Young

relating to the three AIA applications which were subsequently rejected was so patently

and pathetically false. As said earlier, the deceased was not someone who would be

planning for his future financial needs in this way in the first place. If the deceased

was not at the Woodlands flat but at the Petir Road flat, why could not Lim Chok Young

simply re-direct the insurance agents there? Was he someone who was likely to be cowed by

two insurance agents who refused to leave the flat unless some business was transacted?

Clearly not. The deceased was portrayed as someone with ample cash to spare, who was

willing to "oblige" two agents not at his flat by buying $300,000 in insurance

without even knowing what sort of policy it was. Clearly, Lim Chok Young was again lying

in this matter. He had arranged the insurance himself. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">252 I now come to the fateful day of 2

June 1997 in room 505, Pailin Hotel, Phnom Penh. If the deceased had lost his appetite for

a couple of days, it was indeed strange that Lim Chok Young should arrange lunch to be at

12 noon when they had finished breakfast at 8.30 am, only three and a half hours earlier.

Further, since the deceased did not leave the fully airconditioned hotel on 1 June 1997

and 2 June 1997 and was not feeling well, why would he be taking a bath just before lunch?

It could not be because he was feeling hot. If Lim Chok Young merely wanted him to freshen

up and feel better, knowing that it would take time to fill the bath tub and aware of the

slow movements of the deceased, why suggest taking a bath – not a shower – when

it was already 11.30 am and they were to meet at the lobby at 12 noon?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">253 The way the deceased was found lying

in the flooded bath tub certainly did not suggest that he had fallen into the water,

whether because of a fainting spell or otherwise. The unnatural position of his right arm

suggested strongly that it had been held at his back by someone. As stated earlier, the

deceased was a man accustomed to hunger and it was highly unlikely that his poor appetite

– if he ever had a good one – had affected him to such an extent. Further, Lim

Chok Young’s ridiculous additional evidence in the witness box about the possibility

of the deceased wanting to splash water on him did not help the Plaintiff’s case at

all.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">254 Once the entire chain of events and

all the surrounding circumstances were considered together, rather than as isolated,

unrelated parts, I could only arrive at the irresistible conclusion that Lim Chok Young

and his wife, the Plaintiff, driven by their determination to become rich, conspired to

cause the death of the deceased intentionally in order to benefit from the insurance

monies. Lim Chok Young was the prime mover of the whole scheme. Even if the Plaintiff was

not aware of the exact details of the plot to extinguish the life of the deceased, she

obviously knew that an "accident" of some sort had been planned for the poor

simpleton abroad. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">255 The trips by Lim Chok Young and the

deceased to neighbouring countries between February and May 1997 were nothing more than a

ploy by Lim Chok Young to create the impression that they were constant, merry travelling

companions. The trips were not made in order that a kind and altruistic "nephew"

could fulfil his aging uncle’s wish to travel by aeroplane – they were flights

in the final journey leading to the eventual designated place of execution. Lim Chok Young

also did not want an autopsy to be conducted here for it might reveal the actual cause of

death of the deceased. For this reason, he chose to forget all about the precious

insurance policies taken out to cover both of them in such an "emergency" and

neglected to inform the insurance companies, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to

decide on repatriation of the body.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">256 Insofar as the deceased’s death

was not accidental, it was not covered by the policies concerning accidental death. In

respect of the policies covering death from any cause, violent or otherwise, public policy

must surely prevent the Plaintiff from claiming any money thereunder. As a fellow

conspirator, the Plaintiff’s hands were as stained with blood as Lim Chok

Young’s. No one should be permitted to benefit directly or indirectly from his/her

own wrong. Certainly no killer should be allowed to come to Court to collect blood money.

This is so even if I am wrong in finding that the Plaintiff was involved in the said

conspiracy. If the Plaintiff was innocent, it would still be wrong to allow her to benefit

from her husband’s criminal conduct as that would condone the criminal act done for

the sake of benefiting his family. That assumes that Lim Chok Young would not be

benefiting from the insurance monies. However, public policy applies with even greater

force here as Lim Chok Young would obviously have a share of the insurance monies if they

were paid out to the Plaintiff. He has agreed that would be so and the pay out of $100,000

by GE Life put it beyond all doubt that both husband and wife would benefit jointly. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">257 I now deal with the secondary issues

in this case. The first is whether there was material non-disclosure by the deceased

insured in respect of his health problems as revealed in the medical examination in

October 1996 by Dr Lum Foong Poon and the subsequent rejection of his application for

insurance by AIA.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">258 It is trite law that a contract of

insurance is one of utmost good faith and that an applicant for insurance is under a duty

to disclose all information which a prudent insurer would consider material. Such a duty

exists regardless of whether the insured has been asked to complete a proposal form or

whether he has been asked any other questions by the insurer (<i>The Asia Insurance Co Ltd

v Tat Hong Plant Leasing Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 CLJ 330</nobr> at page 335).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">259 The insurance policies that came into

being after October 1996 were the five travel insurance policies in issue in this case.

These policies insured generally against death or injury from violent or accidental means.

They excluded causes such as sickness, disease or medical disorder. It could not therefore

be said that the deceased’s state of health would have mattered to the insurers here

and, consequently, the rejection of the October 1996 application on this ground. Insurers

issuing travel insurance policies would only be interested in the personal particulars of

the proposed insured, the proposed destination(s), the total period of travel and perhaps

the purpose of travel. This was borne out in practice in the instances mentioned in this

case. One could easily buy travel insurance without being physically present at the

agencies. It is also axiomatic that violent acts and accidents could happen to anyone

whether in the pink of health or weak and sickly. What may be material is how careful or

careless a person is, not how healthy or diseased he is.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">260 The second issue concerns the First

Defendants’ policy, Clause 7 of which provided that the insured person could only be

covered under one such policy for the same trip whereas the deceased was covered by four

other such policies. Further, Clause 1 of the said policy provided that the insured must

be fit to travel and not be aware of any circumstances which could lead to the

cancellation or disruption of the trip. It was provided in the General Conditions that

compliance with the terms was a condition precedent to any liability of the insurers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">261 The Defendants submitted that the

Cambodian Investigation Committee’s reports indicated that the deceased’s health

was not good since his arrival in Phnom Penh. In addition, the deceased had missed the

tour on 1 June 1997. The Defendants therefore argued that the deceased had breached

Clauses 1 and 7.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">262 With respect, I disagree. The deceased

might have been tired or lost his appetite after travelling to Cambodia but these facts

did not imply that he was therefore not fit to travel. Anybody could become tired or feel

queasy while on tour without being unfit to travel. Where Clause 7 is concerned, there is

no reason to read it broadly as preventing insured persons from buying further insurance

from others if they so wish. "One such policy for the same trip" could be read

meaningfully as only one travel insurance policy from the First Defendants. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">263 The Defendants further contended that

the First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants were deprived of their contractual right to

conduct a post mortem examination or autopsy of the body by the failure to inform them of

the death and by the cremation on 4 June 1997. The Plaintiff argued that the term in the

policies relating to this (expressed in various terminology) did not go so far as to state

that unless the Defendants had an opportunity to do a post mortem examination, they would

not be liable. The Plaintiff contended the relevant term merely reserved the right of the

insurers to do a post mortem examination if they so wished. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">264 A reservation of a right necessarily

implies a duty to inform coupled with the giving of a reasonable opportunity to examine.

There would be nothing left of the right if the insurers were not informed of the death at

all before cremation took place. Similarly the right would be a wholly illusory one if

notice of the death was given minutes before the body was turned into ashes. Where the

policy provides for a period within which notice must be given of any bodily injury or of

death, that period can only begin to run from the time an opportunity arises for the

giving of notice. Say, for instance, an insured were trekking in jungles and got injured

in some remote, deserted area without a cellular telephone. It would be absurd to require

notice, especially a written one, to be given immediately or even within one week if the

rescue team could only reach the injured and return him to civilization after that period.

This must apply with even greater logical force to a case where death has unfortunately

occurred because the party informing the insurers about the death would obviously not be

the insured! In the same example given, death could have occurred without anyone

discovering it for some period of time. Further, if the body was cremated by some third

party or was somehow lost or destroyed, there could be no question of breach of any term

pertaining to the insurers’ right to repatriate and to perform an autopsy because

that would be compelling the impossible to be done.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">265 Coming back to the facts of this case,

Lim Chok Young could not plead that he was unaware of the policies in the deceased’s

name. He had access to telecommunication facilities and to assistance from the Singapore

Embassy in Phnom Penh. He even spoke twice to the Plaintiff who was in Singapore. He and

the Plaintiff had every opportunity of informing any of the five insurers to seek their

advice or instructions on the repatriation of the body or its disposal but they did not do

so. It was not a situation where the Cambodian authorities had ordered a cremation to be

done immediately or at all. The cremation was Lim Chok Young’s and the

Plaintiff’s considered decision. In such circumstances, they have deprived the

insurers of their contractual right to examine the body or to bring it to Singapore or

elsewhere for an autopsy to be conducted. The insurers were therefore entitled to deny

liability on this ground as there was a breach of a condition precedent. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE CONCLUSION</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">266 The Plaintiff’s claim against all

five Defendants must therefore fail. As I ruled against the Defendants’ contentions

in respect of two of the secondary issues, I ordered the Plaintiff to pay 90% of the costs

of this action, to be taxed or agreed. </font></p>
