        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 8 April 2010, the directors of the
                    plaintiff, Jurong Data Centre Development Pte Ltd (“JDD”), passed
                    a resolution acknowledging that JDD could not continue business by reason of its
                    liabilities. A provisional liquidator was appointed the same day. On
                    22 April 2010, this action was commenced to challenge certain security
                    given to the first defendant, M+W Singapore Pte Ltd (“M+W”), and
                    the appointment of the second to fourth defendants (“the
                    Receivers”) as receivers and managers under M+W’s security. The
                    purpose of the action is to determine whether particular assets of JDD are
                    available for the benefit of its unsecured creditors or whether M+W is a secured
                    creditor with priority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       JDD was incorporated on 21 January 2008 for
                    the purpose of developing, building and owning a state-of-the-art data centre
                    (“the Data Centre”). JDD is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of
                    Japan Land Limited (“JLL”), an investment holding company listed
                    on the Singapore Exchange.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       For the purposes of its business, JDD applied to
                    the Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”) for permission to develop and
                    then lease the piece of land known as Private Lot A2534304, also known as
                    Government Survey Lot 8441A of Mukim 5 (“the property”). By a
                    letter dated 8 April 2008, JTC offered JDD a three-year licence of the
                    property commencing 16 June 2008 and pursuant to this offer, on
                    22 December 2008, JTC and JDD executed a building agreement relating to the
                    property (“the building agreement”). Under the building agreement,
                    JDD was granted a licence of and authority to enter onto the property for a
                    period of three years from 16 June 2008 for the purpose of building the
                    Data Centre (“the project”) on the property. The building
                    agreement also provided that upon completion of the project (and subject to
                    certain conditions), JTC would grant JDD a 30-year lease of the property
                    commencing retrospectively from 16 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Following a tender exercise, M+W was appointed
                    the main contractor for the project. On 19 February 2009, a construction
                    agreement was concluded between JDD and M+W (“the construction
                    agreement”). M+W was to design, construct and complete the project for a
                    price of approximately $213m to be paid by JDD in a progressive manner in
                    accordance with the terms of the construction agreement. Construction work
                    commenced shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Until June 2009, JDD funded the construction
                    costs of the project by using its own capital and obtaining loans from other
                    companies which were related or associated with JLL (collectively “JL
                    Group”). In the meantime, JLL was actively looking for other sources of
                    funds. Around June 2009, JDD started negotiations with an external investor,
                    Elchemi Group Limited (“Elchemi”), which was a private investment
                    firm incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 21 August 2009, Elchemi entered into a
                    memorandum of understanding with certain JL Group companies which envisaged that
                    Elchemi would take up a 50% shareholding in JDD. It was subsequently agreed that
                    Elchemi’s wholly owned subsidiary, ConnectedPlanet Holding Limited
                    (“ConnectedPlanet”) would front the investment. At about the same
                    time, JDD’s financial resources ran out and it started defaulting on the
                    progress payments due to M+W. In order to reassure M+W about payment, on
                    14 September 2009, JDD introduced Elchemi to M+W and told M + W that
                    Elchemi would be providing equity and debt funding to JDD to enable the project
                    to be completed. JLL itself took steps to inject further capital into JDD and by
                    23 October 2009, JDD had an increased share capital of $25m and JLL had
                    become its sole shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       None of the new money moved to M+W although, at
                    about the same time, M+W had been demanding assurances from JDD regarding
                    payment of its outstanding bills amounting to $59,382,859.95. It threatened to
                    stop work on the project unless payment was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 24 October 2009, a meeting initiated by
                    M+W to discuss JDD’s financial situation took place in Tokyo. There are
                    differing accounts of what happened there. M+W’s CEO, Mr Kurzboeck,
                    demanded a first pledge over JDD’s assets in order for M+W to continue
                    work on the project. M+W alleged that this demand was accepted on behalf of JDD.
                    JDD, however, averred that no such agreement was reached at that time as the JL
                    Group needed to get certain internal approvals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the afternoon of 27 October 2009,
                    M+W’s solicitors, WongPartnership LLP (“WongPartnership”)
                    sent, <em>inter alia</em>, a draft debenture (“the
                    Debenture”) and a draft security undertaking (“the Security
                    Undertaking”) to Mr Leow Tet Sin, a director of JDD, for execution.
                    The next morning, M+W’s managing director, Mr Cris Dedigama
                    (“Mr Dedigama”), went to JDD’s office to discuss and
                    execute the Debenture and Security Undertaking. That afternoon, there was an
                    urgent board meeting of the directors of JLL to obtain approval for the
                    execution of the Security Undertaking and Debenture. Mr Leow informed the
                    meeting that approximately $59m was owing to M+W and in order for M+W to seek
                    permission from its head office in Germany to continue to fund the construction
                    and completion of the project, M+W required execution of the documents.
                    Mr Leow also informed the meeting that if the documents were not executed,
                    M+W would take immediate legal action to enforce recovery and would cease to
                    carry out any work under the construction agreement. JDD executed the two
                    documents that same evening (28 October 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the face of the document, cl 3 of the
                    Debenture granted M+W a first fixed and floating charge over JDD’s present
                    and future assets, with the exception of the property which was to be subject to
                    a mortgage upon the written consent of JTC being obtained. Clause 6.3 of
                    the Debenture obliged JDD to use its best endeavours to obtain any consent
                    necessary to enable its assets to be the subject of an effective fixed charge or
                    assignment as contemplated by cl 3. Similarly, as provided under
                    cl 5.2(a) of the Security Undertaking, JDD undertook to procure the written
                    consent of JTC to the entry of a mortgage of the property in favour of M+W. In
                    consideration of JDD’s performance of its obligations under the Security
                    Undertaking, M+W agreed in cl 4 that it would not cease to perform its
                    obligations under the construction agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 30 October 2009, M+W lodged a caveat
                    (“the first caveat”) against the property on the ground that it
                    was a mortgagee under the documents that had been executed. On 6 November
                    2009, JDD objected to the lodging of the first caveat, contending that it was
                    inconsistent with the JDD directors’ understanding that the Debenture and
                    the Security Undertaking were not meant to take full effect, registered or
                    enforced, pending JDD’s negotiations with Elchemi. On 10 November
                    2009, M+W denied that such an understanding existed. The first caveat, however,
                    remained and JDD did not take any steps to have it removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 3 November 2009, the negotiations
                    between Elchemi and the JL Group ended. Pursuant thereto, JDD and
                    ConnectedPlanet entered into an investment agreement whereunder ConnectedPlanet
                    was to invest $71m to acquire a portion of JLL’s shares in JDD
                    (“the investment agreement”). On completion of the transaction,
                    ConnectedPlanet would own 85% of the enlarged issued share capital of
                    JDD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 18 November 2009, representatives from
                    JDD, M+W and Elchemi met officers of JTC (“the JTC meeting”) to
                    explain to them what was happening with the project and to seek JTC’s
                    consent for the grant of a mortgage over the property in favour of M+W. There is
                    a dispute over whether the Debenture was mentioned during the meeting but the
                    JTC officers were definitely told of JDD’s desire to grant a mortgage in
                    favour of M+W pending the receipt of the investment from ConnectedPlanet. After
                    the meeting, Mr Leow wrote a letter, dated 18 November 2009, to JTC in
                    which he reiterated the reason for the meeting and the fact that JDD needed a
                    new investor to complete the project. Mr Leow forwarded a copy of the
                    investment agreement with ConnectedPlanet to JTC and said that pending the
                    investment, the mortgage would provide security to M+W “for the purpose
                    of a ‘Bridge Financing’ to complete the
                project”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 25 November 2009, JDD, M+W and
                    ConnectedPlanet entered into an agreement (“the refinancing
                    agreement”). By this agreement, JDD acknowledged that the filing of the
                    Debenture with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority by M+W had been
                    lawfully and properly carried out. It further agreed to submit a request for,
                    and obtain, JTC’s approval in respect of the creation of a deed of
                    assignment of the building agreement and a mortgage over the property to secure
                    JDD’s obligations under, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    Debenture and the construction agreement. In return, M+W agreed that JDD would
                    not be required to make any payment under the construction agreement until three
                    days had elapsed from its receipt of Elchemi’s investment or
                    31 January 2010, whichever was the earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the meantime, on 19 November 2009, JTC
                    had given its in principle agreement or consent to the arrangement. The formal
                    approval was set out in a subsequent letter dated 4 December 2009
                    (“the JTC consent letter”) and this contained the following
                    conditions which had to be observed by JDD:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the same day, JDD accepted the terms and
                    conditions imposed by JTC for its consent to the mortgage and returned an
                    acceptance letter to JTC (“the acceptance letter”). The acceptance
                    letter was stated (in Annex B) that the mortgage was intended to secure:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The performance of all obligations that [JDD] may at any time have to
                        [M+W] under or pursuant to the [Debenture] ...; the [construction agreement]
                        ..., the [Security Undertaking] ..., the Deed of Assignment, the Mortgage
                        and any other security, including but not limited to the repayment of all
                        sums outstanding from [JDD] to [M+W] under the [construction agreement],
                        including contractual interest payable pursuant to the terms of the
                        [construction agreement], as well as any other interest, costs and fees
                        thereon (including but not limited to legal fees incurred in connection
                        therewith), whether present or future, actual or contingent (and whether
                        incurred solely or jointly and whether as principal or as surety or in some
                        other capacity).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Within the next few days, JDD and M+W executed
                    an Assignment of Building Agreement (“the Deed of Assignment”) and
                    JDD also executed a mortgage document in escrow (the “Mortgage”).
                    The Mortgage contained a certification by JDD’s lawyers that “[M+W]
                    has agreed that the Mortgage shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of
                    [JTC’s] letter dated 4 December 2009 consenting to this
                    Mortgage”. M+W then lodged a caveat (“the second caveat”)
                    against the property, purportedly to register M+W’s interest on the land
                    on the basis of the Deed of Assignment and the Mortgage. Hereafter the
                    Debenture, the Security Undertaking, the Deed of Assignment and the Mortgage are
                    sometimes collectively referred to as (“the Security
                    Documents”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In an unrelated but important development,
                    on 15 January 2010, the relevant government authority refunded to JDD a sum
                    of $6,456,230.09 representing the net surplus of goods and services tax that had
                    been paid (“the GST Refund”). At the time of the proceedings,
                    whilst most of the GST Refund had been spent, $1,107,816.58 remained. This money
                    is in the hands of the Receivers and is being claimed by JDD for the benefit of
                    the unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After the execution of the Security Documents,
                    M+W continued work on the project and on 2 February 2010, the Building and
                    Construction Authority issued a temporary occupation permit
                    (“TOP”) in respect of the Data Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As things turned out, due to internal
                    problems, Elchemi and ConnectedPlanet eventually failed to make the promised
                    investment in JDD or to pay any part of the construction costs due to
                    M+W.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     ConnectedPlanet had agreed to pay M+W the sum
                    of $154,984,800.40 pursuant to an assignment agreement dated 12 January
                    2010. By this document, in consideration of such promise, M+W had assigned its
                    rights under the construction agreement to ConnectedPlanet. On 12 March
                    2010, M+W gave notice to JDD that the assignment agreement would be terminated
                    with immediate effect unless ConnectedPlanet and/or Elchemi complied fully with
                    their obligations. Similarly, on 18 March 2010, JDD’s solicitors
                    wrote to ConnectedPlanet’s solicitors to inform them that JDD would
                    consider ConnectedPlanet to be in breach of the investment agreement unless
                    completion took place on 19 March 2010. Completion was not effected on the
                    specified date and on 23 March 2010, JDD sent a notice of immediate
                    termination of the investment agreement to ConnectedPlanet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Meanwhile, as between M+W and JDD, M+W had
                    made a payment claim against JDD in relation to an outstanding progress payment
                    which was due on 27 October 2009. On 18 March 2010, an adjudication
                    award was made in favour of M+W for a total amount of $29,086,796.35. On
                    19 March 2010, M+W gave notice to JDD that monies were due and owing under
                    the construction agreement, and that events of default had occurred pursuant to
                    the terms of the Debenture. M+W then asserted that it would be taking steps to
                    enforce its rights under the Debenture. On 22 March 2010, M+W appointed the
                    second, third and fourth defendants as the joint and several receivers and
                    managers of JDD’s properties, assets and undertaking comprised in the
                    Debenture. On 2 April 2010, the Receivers were further appointed receivers
                    and managers of JDD’s assets pursuant to the Mortgage and the Deed of
                    Assignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 8 April 2010, JDD went into
                    provisional liquidation. Some two weeks later these proceedings were filed to
                    challenge the validity of the Security Documents. On 5 May 2010, JDD
                    convened an extraordinary general meeting, during which resolutions were passed
                    to voluntarily wind up JDD on the basis of its inability to continue its
                    business by reason of its liabilities, as well as to appoint Mr Tam Chee
                    Chong of M/s Deloitte Singapore &amp; Southeast Asia as the liquidator of the
                    company (“the liquidator”). The liquidator thereafter continued
                    with these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As of the date of the winding up, while the
                    TOP had been issued, external works such as the landscaping, pavements and roads
                    remained to be carried out, and final touch-up works were also outstanding. JTC
                    had not by then granted JDD a lease in respect of the property. As at the date
                    of the hearing, JDD still remained a licensee of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     JDD asserts that it is entitled to the reliefs
                    claimed in the proceedings because it is able to show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     JDD has no legal or equitable
                        interest in the land comprised in the property that could be the subject
                        matter of a valid charge or mortgage granted in favour of
                    M+W;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     JDD could not
                        charge or mortgage its contractual rights (as a licensee) over the property
                        in favour of M+W because such rights were governed by the underlying
                        contracts – namely the building agreement and the Debenture
                        respectively, both of which required valid and effective consent from JTC,
                        which JDD failed to obtain;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     JDD did not obtain valid and effective JTC consent under
                        cl 2.22(a) of the building agreement because not all the conditions
                        precedent in JTC’s consent letter dated 4 December 2009 were
                        met;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     JDD did
                        not obtain valid and effective JTC consent to enter into the Debenture with
                        M+W because there is no evidence before the court that JTC’s approval
                        for this specific purpose was ever sought, let alone
                    obtained;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     JTC
                        granted consent to JDD to mortgage the property as an interim financing
                        solution to bridge the period from the date of the Mortgage until
                        ConnectedPlanet was brought into the project as a strategic investor,
                        therefore such consent did not apply to the Debenture which related to
                        repayment of costs incurred under the construction
                    agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_f"></a>(f)     even if
                        JTC had granted consent to JDD to enter into the Debenture, this approval
                        was only valid for prospective costs incurred from, at the earliest, the
                        date of the Mortgage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_g"></a>(g)     the Debenture did not create any fixed charge over JDD’s assets
                        because, prior to the appointment of the Receivers, JDD operated and dealt
                        with its assets – including its bank account(s) and the property
                        – without any restrictions from M+W;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_h"></a>(h)     any floating charge created pursuant to the
                        Debenture was invalid pursuant to s 330 of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                        2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) because it was created within six
                        months of the commencement of JDD’s winding up and no valid cash
                        consideration was extended by M+W at the time of or subsequent to the
                        creation of any such security; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_i"></a>(i)     the requirement under the refinancing agreement for
                        JTC’s consent to the Deed of Assignment and the Mortgage was not
                        satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It would be noted that depending on how I
                    determine some of the issues others may not need to be dealt with. Whether JDD
                    had any interest in the property that could be the subject of a valid charge or
                    mortgage or whether it had a contractual interest that was capable of being used
                    as security must, however, be a threshold issue. I will consider the first two
                    points raised by JDD in tandem and then move on to consider the other issues, as
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the nature of JDD’s interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     JDD submits that it has no legal or equitable
                    interest in the property that could be the subject matter of a valid charge or
                    mortgage granted in favour of M+W. All JDD had or has is a licence, and its only
                    right was to occupy and use the property as provided by cl 2.1 of the
                    building agreement. Apart from that, JDD had no proprietary interest in the
                    property as at the date of execution of the Debenture that could be granted to
                    M+W as security. JDD further argues that whatever its interest in the property
                    is, the same cannot amount to the kind of transmissible interest alluded to in
                        <em>In re Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd</em>
                    [1998] Ch 495 at 508A which is a necessary ingredient of a security
                    interest. At the very minimum, to have a transmissible interest, JDD argues that
                    it must have been party to an agreement to lease with JTC. In this case,
                    however, it contends there was no such agreement to lease. In the alternative,
                    even if an equitable interest could have arisen from JTC’s agreement to
                    grant a lease pursuant to cl 3.1 of the building agreement, JDD argues that
                    the requirements contained therein had yet to be fulfilled at the time the
                    Debenture and Security Undertaking were executed on 28 October 2009; as at
                    that date, the building works were not completely finished and the TOP had not
                    been issued. In those circumstances, JTC would not have granted a lease to JDD
                    on 28 October 2009, and, on the same basis, JDD would not have been able to
                    obtain an order of specific performance of the grant of the lease even if JDD
                    had wanted such relief. At best, JDD had only contractual rights as licensee of
                    the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     JDD also took pains to distinguish its
                    situation from that existing in <em>Power Knight Pte Ltd v
                        Natural Fuel Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) &amp; ors</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 82 (“<em>Power Knight</em>”). In that
                    case, the defendant, Natural Fuel Pte Ltd, entered into two building agreements
                    with JTC where it would have been granted 30-year leases over the relevant
                    properties once certain conditions were met. Until then, the defendant was a
                    licensee who had the right to build and operate its production plants on the
                    properties as if a lease had actually been granted. The defendant subsequently
                    borrowed money and as security for the repayment of the same, it granted a
                    charge over its assets to Power Knight Pte Ltd. The main question posed in
                        <em>Power Knight</em> was whether the
                    liquidator’s caveat (for the unsecured creditors) over the properties
                    ought to be removed. This is not an issue that concerns me here; the reason why
                    JDD seeks to distinguish <em>Power Knight</em> is that in
                    the course of my judgment in that case, I observed that the defendant had an
                    agreement for a lease with JTC and that this agreement had created an equitable
                    lease. JDD submits that <em>Power Knight</em> should be
                    distinguished on the basis that the issues decided there were markedly different
                    from the present dispute (<em>ie</em> whether a statutory
                    trust came into being upon the winding up of a company), that there was no
                    indication that a clause requiring JTC consent was required, and lastly, that
                    the question of whether the defendant was in principle entitled to mortgage or
                    charge the property was not raised in <em>Power Knight</em>
                    and all parties had proceeded on the basis that the defendant there had an
                    interest which it could mortgage or charge. JDD thus submits that <em>Power Knight</em> does not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I was somewhat bemused by the fact that JDD
                    had sought at all to argue that it had no interest in the property which was
                    capable of being charged or mortgaged to M+W. As I pointed out to counsel in the
                    course of argument, over the past 40 years or more, JTC has been entering into
                    building agreements, with various parties who sought to build factories and
                    other industrial buildings, in terms that were more or less similar to those of
                    the building agreement in this case <em>ie</em> that upon
                    the completion of construction on JTC land within a specified period, JTC would
                    grant a lease of the land involved to the developer for a specific period.
                    Further, in many if not most of those cases, the developers have borrowed money
                    to finance the construction costs and have secured repayment by charging or
                    mortgaging their interests under those similar building agreements. Many lawyers
                    have acted in these transactions and have opined that such security constitutes
                    good and enforceable security for the lenders. If I accept JDD’s argument,
                    it would mean completely overturning the conventional wisdom which itself was
                    illustrated in the <em>Power Knight</em> case when all
                    parties involved took it as a given that the defendant had had a sufficient
                    interest in the property covered by the building agreement there to create a
                    mortgage or charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It also appeared to me that JDD was making a
                    u-turn from the position that it had held at the time the Security Documents
                    were negotiated. In October 2009, when M+W asked for security over JDD’s
                    assets, JDD did not respond that it had no interest which was capable of
                    constituting security. Subsequently, it signed the Debenture by which it charged
                    all its real property to M+W and specifically agreed that the real property
                    referred to would include the property once JTC had consented to Mortgage over
                    the same. At the same time, it signed the Security Undertaking and undertook to
                    procure the written consent of JTC to the execution of the Mortgage and the
                    lodging of a caveat with the Singapore Land Authority in respect of the executed
                    mortgage. In due course, JDD met with JTC to explain the transaction and applied
                    in writing for JTC’s consent to the granting of the Mortgage. During this
                    entire period from October 2009 to early December 2009, both JDD and M+W acted
                    on the basis that JDD had the necessary interest in the property to mortgage the
                    same. It appears to me that M+W would have had strong ground to contend that an
                    estoppel by convention had arisen and that JDD was precluded from raising the
                    issue of a lack of interest. M+W did not, however, make full arguments on this
                    basis and since JDD has not addressed the point, I will not deal with it
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The issue I have to address relates to the
                    nature of JDD’s interest in the property at the time of the execution of
                    the Security Documents. What is clear, and what is not disputed by the parties
                    is that, at that time, JDD’s interest in the property was labelled as a
                    licence. Clause 2.1 of the building agreement states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Until the Land is comprised in a lease to be granted as provided in this
                        Agreement, to hold the Land as licensee upon the same terms relating to the
                        lease contained in the formal of [<em>sic</em>] Lease
                        set out in the <u>FIRST SCHEDULE (“First Schedule
                            Lease”)</u> in this Agreement at the same rent and subject
                        to the same covenants, conditions and stipulations so far as applicable as
                        if a lease had actually been granted, and so that the Owner shall have all
                        the remedies by whatever means for rent in arrears that are incidental to
                        the relationship of landlord and tenant. But nothing contained in this
                        Agreement shall be construed as creating a legal demise or any greater
                        interest in the licence than tenancy at will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis as underlined in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">What is in dispute is the exact scope of this licence and whether
                    security may be attached to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is relevant that cl 3 of the building
                    agreement contains an agreement to grant a lease. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    3.1 If:</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    [JDD] has performed and observed all the
                                stipulations contained in this [building agreement]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then <em>[JTC] shall grant and [JDD] shall
                            accept</em> a lease or sub-lease of the [property] together with
                        the buildings so erected on it and the appurtenances for the term of
                            <b>thirty (30) years</b> ... retrospectively from
                        the Licence Commencement Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original, emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the above that when the provisions set out in
                    cl 3.1 were met, JTC would be obliged to grant, and JDD would have to
                    accept, a 30 year lease of the property. The effect of cll 2.1 and 3.1,
                    read together, is that JDD’s interest in the property was not just a plain
                    vanilla possessory interest entitling JDD to remain on the property. The
                    building agreement provides for something more: at the very least, it grants JDD
                    an equitable interest in the property. Had JDD fulfilled the conditions in
                    cl 3.1, and JTC subsequently decided to renege on its promise,
                    theoretically JDD could apply to court for specific performance to compel JTC to
                    grant it a 30 year lease as provided under the building agreement. I therefore
                    hold that JDD had, at the very least, a licence coupled with an
                equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     JDD also makes the further point that no
                    agreement existed between JTC and JDD when the Debenture and Security
                    Undertaking were executed on 28 October 2009. At that point in time, JDD
                    had not fulfilled the conditions in cl 3.1 and, <em>ipso
                        facto</em>, no lease was created. I think this misses the point.
                    JDD’s argument presupposes that all requirements had to be met for the
                    lease before JDD could charge its interest in the building agreement. However,
                    that need not be the case here since the Debenture is broadly worded and
                    sufficiently wide to include <em>any</em> interest JDD had
                    in the property. What was important, at the time of execution, was that JDD had
                        <em>some</em> form of interest in the property,
                        <em>ie</em> the licence coupled with an equity, that
                    the security could be attached to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In my view, it is also maintainable that the
                    building agreement is not just a licence agreement; it is also an agreement to
                    lease. Clause 2.1 of the building agreement (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) recognises that the building agreement is not only a
                    licence agreement, it is also an agreement for “a lease to be
                    granted”. The building agreement itself is said not to create a legal
                    demise but that stipulation does not prevent an equitable lease from arising,
                    once the conditions for the grant of the lease are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, that is exactly what is provided in
                    cl 3.1 read with cl 3.3: that once the conditions for the grant of a
                    lease are satisfied, the licensee shall be deemed to be the lessee of the
                    land:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... From the time of the granting of the lease under clause 3.1 above
                        until the Instrument of Lease is executed, the Licensee shall be deemed to
                        be the Lessee of the [property] for the Lease Term ... as though a lease had
                        been executed...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In any event, the building agreement itself
                    contemplated that the licensee JDD might attempt to create a charge over its
                    interest under that agreement. Clause 2.22(a) of the same provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    [JDD] agrees to perform and observe the following
                            stipulations:-</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.22(a)    Not to assign,

                            under this [building agreement], or the possession or occupation of the
                            [property] from the Licence Commencement Date until the day [JDD]
                            has:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a1)   complied with the Business Park Guidelines
                                stipulated by URA and Urban Design Guidelines; and</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Except That, <em>subject to [JTC’s] prior written
                            consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), [JDD] may
                            mortgage or charge his interest under this [building agreement] by way
                            of assignment or debenture</em> (as the case may be) to secure the
                        repayment of such sum or sums as [JDD] may require for erecting or
                        completing the Building Works in according with this [building agreement]
                        PROVIDED THAT [JDD] shall thereafter continue to be liable for the
                        observance and performance of the several stipulations contained in this
                        [building agreement] until the grant of the lease as provided in clause 3
                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is apparent from the foregoing that JTC did not make a blanket
                    objection to the granting of such a charge, but instead provided that a charge
                    was permissible if its prior written consent had been given. Further, it even
                    limited its discretion to withhold consent by providing specifically that such
                    consent, once requested by the licensee, could not be unreasonably withheld by
                    JTC. Thus, JTC too was of the view that the interest provided to JDD under the
                    building agreement was capable of being charged even prior to the completion of
                    the Data Centre and it had no objection in theory to such a charge as long as it
                    had the necessary control to ensure that the charge was created only for
                    purposes of which it approved and which were consonant with its
                policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In any event, it is clear that the interest
                    necessary to meet the interest requirement of a charge is to be interpreted
                    broadly and the general principle is that most interests can be subject to a
                    charge unless they are, <em>inter alia</em>, of a personal
                    nature. <em>Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and
                        Security</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Goode</em>”) at para 1–55, the permissible
                    objects of security are described thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have previously seen that a pledge cannot be taken over pure
                        intangibles. Subject to this, a security interest may be principle be taken
                        over any kind of property or class of property, tangible or intangible,
                        present of future, including land, goods, negotiable and non-negotiable
                        instruments, documents of title, securities (whether held directly from the
                        issuer or through a securities account with an intermediary), intellectual
                        property rights of various kinds, policies of insurance, transferable
                        licences and quotas, bank deposits and letters of credit, drawing rights
                        under facility agreements with banks, subscription agreements with
                        underwriters, rights under construction contracts, transferable membership
                        rights, and indeed anything which is identifiable and transferable, whether
                        in gross or as appurtenant to land or other property. Moreover, security
                        interests may themselves be given in security, so that a pledgee may grant a
                        sub-pledge, a charge may grant a sub-charge and a mortgagee a sub-mortgage
                        or a charge.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, however, certain categories of property which, by reason of
                        their personal nature, considerations of public policy or a contractual

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In its submissions, M+W argues that it was not
                    necessary for JDD to have a legal or equitable interest in real property in
                    order to grant valid security by way of the Security Documents. In support, it
                    cites the passage from <em>Goode</em> quoted above and the
                    following extract from <em>Fisher &amp; Lightwood’s Law of
                        Mortgage</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths, 12th Ed, 2006) at 198:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                Insurance policies,
                            shares, stocks, book and other debts, equitable interests in land and
                            personalty, and other things in action, legal or equitable, are
                            frequently mortgaged. Save where some special method of disposition is
                            provided by statute, a mortgage of a thing in action is usually effected
                            by an assignment of the thing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On this basis, M+W says that whatever the
                    precise nature of JDD’s rights/interest in the property is (contractual or
                    proprietary; legal or equitable), by executing the Security Documents, JDD had
                    granted a fixed charge over the same to M+W. This was because the Security
                    Documents do not limit M+W’s rights to merely taking possession of and
                    using the property; on the contrary, M+W has been granted all the rights of a
                    mortgagee – to appoint receivers and managers, to sell JDD’s
                    rights/interest in the property, and to have the proceeds thereof applied

                        <em>Goode</em> and other texts is that practically any
                    interest can be charged as long as it is not purely intangible. In my judgment,
                    JDD’s rights and interest under the building agreement were far from being
                    purely intangible because, as I have held above, they amounted to a licence
                    coupled with an equity. Even if they were purely contractual, however, a valid
                    security interest could be taken over them and, at the least, such security
                    interests were created by the Security Documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the reasons given above, I conclude that
                    JDD had sufficient interest in the property and the building agreement to
                    provide M+W with a valid security over the same <em>provided</em> the necessary consents were obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did JDD obtain valid and effective consent from JTC to charge its
                interest in the property to M+W?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     JDD contends that given that any rights it had
                    to charge or mortgage its interest in the property were governed by the building
                    agreement, JDD could not charge or mortgage such interest unless and until it
                    had satisfied the condition in cl 2.22(a) of the building agreement. As
                    that clause provides for such a mortgage or charge to be “by way of
                    assignment or debenture” and to require JTC’s consent, then if
                    there is no valid assignment or debenture between JDD and M+W, there can be no
                    valid charge or mortgage even if JTC’s consent had been obtained. JDD went
                    on to point out that whilst it did execute the Debenture, cl 3.4(b) thereof
                    provided that the security created by the Debenture would not extend to the
                    property “for as long as the consent of [JTC] has not been obtained for
                    the entry into of this Debenture and upon the written consent of [JTC] being
                    obtained, the security created hereby shall extend to the Data Centre”.
                    Therefore, it says that to assert a contractual right to grant a mortgage in
                    favour of M+W, JDD needed the following consents:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">JTC’s consent for JDD for JDD to charge or
                            mortgage its interest under the building agreement to M+W;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">JTC’s consent for JDD’s entry into
                            the Debenture pursuant to cl 3.4 of the Debenture.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">It is JDD’s position that neither of the above consents was ever
                    obtained from JTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Before I go on to discuss the nature and
                    effect of the consent that JTC did give, I would like to deal with the argument
                    that JTC had to consent <em>specifically</em> to
                    JDD’s entry into the Debenture for the Debenture to be valid and
                    enforceable. I do not think that this is the effect of cl 2.22(a) of the
                    building agreement. The material portion of this clause reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]ubject to [JTC’s] prior written consent (which consent shall not
                        be unreasonably withheld), [JDD] may mortgage or charge his interest under
                        this Agreement by way of assignment or debenture (as the case may be) to
                        secure the repayment of such sum or sums as [JDD] may require for erecting
                        or completing the Building Works ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The intention of the clause is to permit JDD to mortgage or charge its
                    interest in the building agreement to secure payment of the construction costs.
                    As I read the clause, the consent required is for the creation of the mortgage
                    or the charge which is the security interest given to the creditor in respect of
                    JDD’s interest in the agreement. How such mortgage or charge is created is
                    not the subject of the consent. There are two methods suggested in the clause
                    but what is purported to be controlled by the necessity for obtaining consent is
                    the fact of creating security and not the manner of creating security. Thus, as
                    long as JTC has agreed to the creation of the security, it is irrelevant that it
                    has not agreed specifically to the particular document, whether it is an
                    assignment or debenture, which contains the provisions creating the
                    security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The requirement of JTC consent for its
                    execution was not, in my view, imposed by the Debenture either. The Debenture as
                    drafted was meant to create security (by way of both fixed and floating charges)
                    over a wide range of JDD’s assets: from its real property to its choses in
                    action and chattels. JTC had no interest in the charges over the choses in
                    action and chattels and no power to prevent JDD from charging the same. The
                    validity of the Debenture in general and as it affected those other assets could
                    not be impugned by a lack of JTC’s consent. <em>The only
                        consequence of the Debenture that depended on JTC’s consent was the
                        validity of the charge over the property which it also contained</em>.
                    To prevent any argument that failure to get consent to the charge over the
                    property would affect the validity of the rest of the Debenture, the parties
                    used cl 3.4(b) of the Debenture to ring-fence the charge over the property
                    so that the same would not be included as part of the security created by the
                    Debenture until JTC’s consent therefor had been obtained.
                    Clause 3.4(b) was not intended to impose a requirement that JTC had to give
                    its consent to the <em>entire</em> Debenture before the
                    same could be executed. Its purpose was much more limited than that and was
                    only, as I have stated, to make it plain that the parties recognised that
                    JTC’s consent was required for a charge over the property and that they
                    were not attempting in any way to avoid complying with that
                requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With the above in mind, I go on to consider
                    the grounds on which JDD contends that JTC’s written consent did not take
                    effect because not all of the conditions precedent were fulfilled. These
                    conditions were contained in para 2 of JTC’s consent letter (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     JDD’s position is that when this
                    paragraph of the consent letter is read in the context of the correspondence
                    from JDD to JTC before and shortly after the meeting in November 2009, it
                    becomes clear that JTC’s consent was predicated on, <em>inter alia</em>, a new investor such as ConnectedPlanet being brought
                    in to the project. This condition precedent was not fulfilled because Elchemi
                    failed to honour its obligation to complete the investment agreement.
                    Consequently, JDD says, JTC’s consent never took effect for the purpose of
                    satisfying the requirement of cl 2.22(a) of the building
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I have no hesitation in rejecting that
                    argument. Reading JTC’s consent letter, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, it seems that the conditions stated in para
                    2(c)(i)–(iii) thereof ought to be satisfied at the time consent was
                    granted, but if there was any change thereafter, that would constitute grounds
                    on which JTC could revoke its consent. M+W, in its submissions, correctly points
                    out that the terms “condition precedent” and
                    “revocable” do not sit easily with each other. Perhaps, if one
                    were to consider the term “condition precedent” technically, it
                    could be said that a party asserting that consent had been given had first to
                    prove that the conditions had been met in order to show that JTC’s consent
                    was an effective consent. It is presumably on this understanding that JDD
                    submits that it did not obtain JTC’s consent for it to either charge or
                    mortgage its interest under the building agreement to M+W. However, considering
                    JTC’s consent letter in its entirety, that could not be the case here.
                    Para 2 of the letter stated that the Mortgage on the property in favour of M+W,
                    the mortgagee, was <em>approved</em> (in the past tense).
                    Had JTC intended for the conditions to be met before approval was granted, it
                    surely would have used the term “<em>will</em>
                    approve” instead. In my judgment, approval was granted and there can be
                    no doubt that JTC consented to JDD using the property as security for the charge
                    or mortgage. Further, the conditions served the additional purpose of providing
                    the background and the understanding on which the consent was
                granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Turning to the specific point about
                    ConnectedPlanet’s entry as an investor, as I have alluded to above, the
                    conditions served the additional purpose of explaining the circumstances in
                    which the consent was granted. These were that the whole purpose of the mortgage
                    was for JTC to allow JDD to grant a charge until ConnectedPlanet’s
                    investment materialised and enabled payment of the outstanding construction
                    costs due to M+W. JDD wished to procure that M+W continued its forbearance in
                    relation to the overdue construction payments and also, importantly, continued
                    with the construction project. As M+W submitted, ConnectedPlanet’s entry
                    as an investor was not a condition <em>per se</em> but was
                    mentioned to mark the termination of the charge, <em>ie</em> the time when M+W would be paid and consequently would have
                    to discharge its mortgage. It was this that was noted by JTC in para 2(c)(iii)
                    of its letter. The interpretation of that paragraph which JDD now contends for
                    would negate the commercial purpose of the exercise. Once ConnectedPlanet put in
                    its investment, JDD would have sufficient funds to pay M+W and there would be no
                    need whatsoever for a mortgage in favour of M+W. It was in the interim period
                    whilst JDD was cash-strapped that it required M+W’s continued support
                    which support M+W was not willing to give unless it had the security of a
                    mortgage or charge. This was specifically explained to JTC at the JTC
                    meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I also agree with M+W that JDD’s
                    contention that para 2(c)(iii) required ConnectedPlanet to be brought on board
                    as a strategic investor was not supported by the evidence of what had happened
                    at the JTC meeting or thereafter or by the evidence of any of JDD’s own
                    witnesses. Mr Ang Chee Seng (“Mr Ang”), the general
                    manager of Elchemi, testified that whilst ConnectedPlanet’s involvement in
                    the project was an important consideration for JTC, the JTC officers did not go
                    so far as to suggest JTC would not grant consent only if ConnectedPlanet
                    invested in JDD. It was Mr Ang’s view, too, that if completion of
                    ConnectedPlanet’s investment was postponed from the date anticipated at
                    the time of the meeting, M+W’s mortgage would continue to be effective
                    until that completion. Mr Leow agreed with Mr Ang that JTC’s
                    officers did not say that consent would not be granted if ConnectedPlanet was
                    not brought in as an investor. As far as Mr Leow was concerned, if the
                    investment by ConnectedPlanet fell through, M+W would be able to enforce its
                    security. Such a view would be inconsistent with any stand that JTC’s
                    consent required participation by ConnectedPlanet and would be nullified by the
                    lack of such participation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The second argument that JDD makes is that the
                    consent should, by reason of paras 2(c)(i) and (iii), be construed as specific
                    to JDD granting a mortgage to M+W for financing purposes only (<em>ie</em> in respect of costs to be incurred) and not to secure
                    repayment of construction costs already incurred under the construction
                    agreement. It points out that the first condition is that the mortgage can only
                    be for the “purpose of completion” of JDD’s development of
                    the Data Centre at the property whilst the third condition is that the mortgage
                    is “only an interim financing solution”. It follows from the first
                    condition that JTC’s consent was forward-looking and intended to cover
                    prospective costs. As for the future period that JTC’s consent was meant
                    to cover, the third condition makes it clear that it was from the date of the
                    mortgage until ConnectedPlanet’s investment in JDD took
                place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     This interpretation is, JDD says, consistent
                    with the evidence of Mr Ang who attended the JTC meeting, that he, the
                    directors of JDD and Mr Dedigama went for that meeting with the
                    understanding that JTC was more likely to grant consent if M+W was in the
                    position of a financier rather than that of a creditor and that was also why M+W
                    and ConnectedPlanet subsequently executed the refinancing
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Contrary to JDD’s position, I observe
                    that the JTC consent letter does not state specifically that the mortgage is to
                    cover only prospective costs. This is the inference that JDD seeks to draw from
                    the references to “interim financing solution” and
                    “completion”. In my view, those references do not point
                    unequivocally to prospective payments. They are capable of meaning a temporary
                    solution to enable completion <em>ie</em> keeping the
                    contractor on board by providing security for outstanding payments and further
                    costs which will accrue and thereby encouraging him to continue his work to
                    complete the project. It is the latter interpretation that is supported by the
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     First, both Mr Leow and Mr Ang
                    agreed that the reference to an “interim financing solution” to
                    “bridge the period” in para 2(c)(iii) simply referred to M+W
                    continuing to finance the construction costs itself until the funds invested by
                    ConnectedPlanet were paid to JDD. Mr Ang’s evidence was that the
                    parties had told JTC that they were going to restructure the arrangement among
                    themselves such that it would be M+W “financing the deal or providing
                    financing to the deal right up to the point where the investment agreement is to
                    be completed”. He then commented that in its consent letter, JTC had
                    pretty much used the language that the parties had used in the meeting like
                    “bridge financing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Secondly, the wording of the acceptance letter
                    (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) submitted by JDD after
                    receipt of the consent letter showed that it did not consider that the consent
                    letter limited the scope of the Mortgage to covering prospective costs. In that
                    acceptance letter which was completed by JDD and submitted on 4 December
                    2009, JDD described the secured obligations as “including but not limited
                    to the repayment of <em>all sums</em> outstanding from
                    [JDD] to [M+W] under the [construction agreement]” (emphasis added). JDD
                    knew that this was the case because it was aware that M+W’s condition for
                    continuing with the construction work was that outstanding amounts had to be
                    secured. This had been made plain to JDD at the meeting of 24 October 2009.
                    In informing JTC of this position, JDD was only confirming what must have been
                    impliedly if not expressly conveyed at the November meeting. If JDD had thought
                    that the consent letter limited the scope of the Mortgage to prospective costs,
                    it would have been obliged under the Security Undertaking to ask JTC to revise
                    the terms of its consent so as to cover the outstanding costs. It made no such
                    request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In any event, even if the conditions imposed
                    by JTC were breached, this would not nullify JTC’s consent for the purpose
                    of these proceedings. As M+W argues, it is not sufficient for JDD to establish
                    that JTC could have revoked its consent because the conditions had been breached
                    (whether due to ConnectedPlanet’s failure to invest in JDD or the Mortgage
                    securing the outstanding construction costs). What the letter stated was that
                    JTC would have the right to revoke its consent in the event of such a breach. Up
                    to the date of the hearing, there was no evidence before me that JTC had raised
                    any issues in relation to its consent or that it had revoked its consent. Until
                    and unless JTC revokes its consent, the consent must remain in place and the
                    validity of the Security Documents cannot be challenged on the basis of lack of
                    consent because of a right to revoke in certain circumstances, even though those
                    circumstances may have occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     JDD also argues that it was required to obtain
                    JTC’s consent to execute the Deed of Assignment and to grant the Mortgage
                    by the refinancing agreement and that it did not do so. The refinancing
                    agreement was executed on 25 November 2009 between M+W, JDD and
                    ConnectedPlanet for the purpose of documenting the various arrangements between
                    the parties. These included JDD undertaking to, within three days of receiving
                    the investment amount contributed by ConnectedPlanet, and in any event no later
                    than 31 January 2010, use this money to satisfy the outstanding amount due
                    to M+W and keep the balance to meet further construction costs. These
                    obligations of JDD were referred to in the refinancing agreement as the
                    “RA Obligations”. ConnectedPlanet for its part agreed to provide
                    the investment amount by a certain date and M+W agreed that upon JDD satisfying
                    the RA Obligations, it would release and terminate the Debenture, discharge the
                    Deed of Assignment and Mortgage and withdraw the caveats lodged against the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Clause 1(b) of the refinancing agreement reads
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">JDD shall submit a request for approval to JTC and obtain the same in
                        relation to the creation of a deed of assignment (the <b>“</b><b><u>Deed of
                            Assignment</u></b><b>”</b>) of the
                        [building agreement] ... made between JDD and JTC and a mortgage (the
                            <b>“</b><b><u>Mortgage</u></b><b>”</b>) by JDD in
                        favour of [M+W] over [the property] ... to secure the performance of all
                        obligations that JDD may at any time have to [M+W] under or pursuant to the

                        the Deed of Assignment, the Mortgage and any other security ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     JDD points out that there is no evidence that
                    JDD or M+W discussed the proposed terms of the refinancing agreement with JTC.
                    It argues that M+W was concerned about this omission after it received a copy of
                    JTC’s consent letter. On 8 November 2009, M+W’s solicitors
                    wrote to JDD’s solicitors pointing out that under para 2(c)(iii) of the
                    JTC consent letter, the Mortgage was to “bridge” the period
                    lasting until ConnectedPlanet was brought into the project but that under the
                    refinancing agreement, the Mortgage and Deed of Assignment would only be
                    discharged when all the RA Obligations had been met. The solicitors were
                    concerned that this was not the same as what was contemplated by the said para
                    2(c)(iii). In a further letter written on 17 December 2009, M+W’s
                    solicitors reiterated that cl 2(b) of the refinancing agreement was not the
                    same as para 2(c)(iii) of the JTC consent letter and said that M+W wanted JTC to
                    be made aware of the material terms of the refinancing agreement. They
                    explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is essential as JTC may subsequently discover that it has consented
                        to the Mortgage and Deed of Assignment based on an incomplete understanding
                        of the factual background relating to the above matter and exercise their
                        right to revoke their consent (which is expressly provided for in paragraph
                        2 of the JTC [l]etter).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     JDD acknowledges that if this action were
                    between the two contracting parties <em>inter se</em> then
                    it could not rely on its own default with respect to its obligation under the
                    refinancing agreement to obtain JTC’s consent for its entry into the Deed
                    of Assignment and the granting of the Mortgage. It submits, however, that since
                    the conduct of this action was taken over by the liquidator, it is now being
                    maintained and prosecuted by the liquidator on behalf of all the unsecured
                    creditors of JDD. This it says is not an action between the contracting parties
                    of the refinancing agreement, <em>ie</em> JDD and M+W,
                    only. Further, M+W is not a blameless party who should be protected by the
                    principle because it acted in disregard of the terms and conditions of the
                    refinancing agreement when it proceeded with the execution of the Deed of
                    Assignment on 8 December 2009 and the registration of the Mortgage on
                    11 December 2009 before confirming or ensuring that JDD had obtained the
                    relevant JTC consent. M+W should not be able to rely on this default to steal a
                    march on other creditors of JDD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     M+W’s response is that this argument is
                    misconceived on two bases. First, JTC did give consent for a mortgage over
                    JDD’s interest in the property in favour of M+W. The execution of the Deed
                    of Assignment and the Mortgage were effected pursuant to that consent. Indeed,
                    Annex A to the acceptance letter identifies the “[Mortgage] and Deed of
                    Assignment” as the relevant documents that would be entered into pursuant
                    to JTC’s consent. In addition, JDD’s then solicitors had certified
                    on the Mortgage that the mortgagee (M+W) had agreed that the Mortgage would be
                    subject to all the terms and conditions of the JTC consent letter. Further,
                    nothing in the refinancing agreement was intended to “affect, supercede
                    or replace” the provisions of any other agreements entered or to be
                    entered into between JDD and M+W (see cl 4(c) of that agreement). The JTC
                    meeting had taken place against the backdrop of the Security Documents in
                    existence at that point of time and both of these required JDD to obtain
                    JTC’s consent and to execute a mortgage in favour of M+W. Accordingly, the
                    process of obtaining JTC’s consent and the consent thereby obtained could
                    not be voided by the refinancing agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Secondly, the refinancing agreement did not
                    require “fresh consent” to be obtained for the Deed of Assignment
                    and Mortgage. The refinancing agreement was concluded in the aftermath of the
                    JTC meeting and, as Mr Ang testified, it was drawn up straight after the
                    JTC meeting so that the parties could structure the deal in line with the
                    representations they had made to JTC. Thus, the refinancing agreement was simply
                    repeating what had been provided for in the Debenture and Security Undertaking
                    and the consent process required by the refinancing agreement was duly
                    undertaken by JDD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I accept the above arguments made by M+W. I
                    also agree that if fresh consent was required after the execution of the
                    refinancing agreement, then it was JDD’s obligation to obtain the same and
                    it cannot now say that because it did not do so, the security is invalid. In
                    this regard, M+W did raise the argument of estoppel by convention and noted that
                    after 4 December 2009, both parties proceeded on the basis that the consent
                    given by JTC was valid and effective and that M+W had valid security over the
                    property. It was only on that basis that M+W continued to work on the
                    construction of the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As regards JDD’s assertion that there
                    was no evidence on record that JDD or M+W discussed the refinancing agreement
                    with JTC after the JTC meeting in order to obtain the approval required by the
                    refinancing agreement, M+W pointed out that there were e-mails which evidenced
                    that JDD’s solicitors had been in contact with JTC after the meeting but
                    there was no evidence as to what JDD’s solicitors had told JTC. It was
                    wrong for JDD to suggest (and it could not do so) that its own solicitors must
                    have failed to inform JTC of the refinancing agreement in the course of their
                    communications with JTC. Further, in the same letter that M+W’s solicitors
                    wrote expressing their concerns, they had asked JDD to confirm that it had no
                    objections to M+W contacting JTC directly to inform JTC of the material terms of
                    the refinancing agreement. No such confirmation was given and in fact
                    JDD’s solicitors had informed M+W’s solicitors that JDD was of the
                    view that there was no need to disclose details of the refinancing agreement to
                    JTC. In these circumstances, I agree that it really does not lie in JDD’s
                    mouth to contend that the provisions of the refinancing agreement affected the
                    consent in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I should add that I do not accept the
                    distinction that JDD sought to draw between itself and the liquidator. The
                    liquidator cannot be in a better position than JDD itself in relation to
                    JDD’s failure to comply with its legal obligations under the refinancing
                    agreement since the liquidator is enforcing the rights of the company and not
                    any independent rights. The fact that the beneficiaries of the
                    liquidator’s action would be the unsecured creditors does not, to my mind,
                    change this position and JDD has given me no authority in support of any
                    argument to the contrary. In my view too, M+W was not blameworthy in any way.
                    JDD’s solicitors had informed M+W’s solicitors that JDD had
                    fulfilled its obligation to lodge a notice of mortgage with JTC and that there
                    was no need to disclose the details of the refinancing agreement to JTC. M+W had
                    a copy of the letter of consent and, in the face of JDD’s stand, was
                    entitled not to do anything further despite any misgivings it may have
                    had.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the charge created under the Debenture void pursuant to s 330 of
                the Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Section 330 of the Act states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>330</b>.    A floating charge
                            on the undertaking or property of the company created within 6 months of
                            the commencement of the winding up shall, unless it is proved that the
                            company immediately after the creation of the charge was solvent, be
                            invalid except to the amount of any cash paid to the company at the time
                            of or subsequently to the creation of and in consideration for the
                            charge together with interest on that amount at the rate of 5% per
                            annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Accordingly, says JDD, under s 330, save
                    for any new cash paid to JDD at the time of or subsequent to the creation of the
                    charges that were purportedly created under the Debenture and in consideration
                    for the same, such charges would be void if they were created within six months
                    of the commencement of JDD’s winding up unless it is proven (the burden of
                    proof being on M+W) that JDD was solvent immediately after the charges were
                    granted. M+W’s first line of reply is that s 330 does not apply to
                    the charges created under the Debenture which it has enforced because these were
                    fixed charges. This argument is also made by the Receivers. I will consider this
                    position first because it is only if the charges in question are floating
                    charges that I need to consider whether JDD was solvent at the time they were
                    created and whether any new cash consideration was provided.</p>

                    enunciated the classic description of the hallmarks of a floating charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I certainly think that if a charge has the three characteristics that
                        I am about to mention it is a floating charge. (1.) If it is a charge on a
                        class of assets of a company present and future; (2.) if that class is one
                        which, in the ordinary course of the business of the company, would be
                        changing from time to time; and (3.) if you find that by the charge it is
                        contemplated that, until some future step is taken by or on behalf of those
                        interested in the charge, the company may carry on its business in the
                        ordinary way as far as concerns the particular class of assets I am dealing
                        with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     JDD argues that the charges created under the
                    Debenture were floating charges because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     JDD continued to operate and deal
                        with its assets from the date of execution of the Debenture until
                        the appointment of the Receivers on 22 March 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     before the Receivers took possession
                        of the property, JDD’s directors and management were not hindered in
                        their day to day dealings with the property. For example, in relation to
                        entering into contracts with suppliers and sub-contractors, negotiations
                        with potential tenants and the ability to incur expenditure in relation to
                        the property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)     the mere lodging of a caveat over real property does not create any
                        interest in that property so M+W could not acquire a fixed interest in the
                        property by reason of the lodging of the first and second
                    caveats;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_d"></a>(d)     since
                        cl 3.4(b) of the Debenture made the creation of a fixed charge over the
                        property contingent on JDD obtaining JTC’s consent for it to enter
                        into the Debenture, the agreement therein for JDD to grant a fixed charge
                        over the property to M+W in the future, after JTC’s consent had been
                        procured, was a mere contract and not an equitable
                    charge;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_e"></a>(e)     even if the
                        Mortgage constituted valid security, it is not a fixed charge; it is at best
                        a floating charge since “[u]nder a fixed charge the asset is
                        appropriated to satisfaction of the debt immediately or upon the debtor
                        acquiring an interest in it” (see <em>Goode</em>
                        at para 1–10). In this case, JDD had no legal or equitable interest in
                        the property when the charge, if any came into existence with the execution
                        of the Debenture on 28 October 2009 and therefore the charge created in
                        that document could only be a floating charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As far as the Mortgage is concerned, I cannot
                    accept that it is a floating charge. I have found that under the building
                    agreement, JDD had an equitable interest in the property that was capable of
                    being charged. Accordingly, this interest existed when the Debenture was created
                    and therefore JDD was capable of granting a fixed charge over the property
                        <em>via</em> the Debenture once JTC’s approval
                    was granted and, <em>a fortiori</em>, was capable of
                    granting a fixed charge over the property <em>via</em> the
                    Mortgage which was executed after JTC’s consent had been
                obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The question of whether the Debenture created
                    fixed or floating charges over the assets in question which are the GST Refund
                    and the property is a question that has to be answered by reference to the
                    document itself. The nature of the rights given to M+W under the Debenture have
                    to be scrutinised so that one can determine whether the three characteristics of
                    a floating charge mentioned by Romer LJ (see <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above) are in fact present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Before embarking on this exercise, it might be
                    helpful to refer to another case, <em>Agnew v Commissioner of
                        Inland Revenue</em> [2001] 2 AC 710 (“<em>Agnew</em>”), which is a more recent decision on the
                    categorisation and characteristics of charges. There, the Privy Council held
                    that a charge over the uncollected book debts of a company which left the
                    company free to collect those debts and use the proceeds in the ordinary course
                    of business was a floating charge. Lord Millett, who delivered the decision of
                    the Privy Council, made it clear that the <em>core factor which
                        characterised the security as a floating charge was the freedom of the
                        charger to remove the asset from the security without the consent of the
                        chargee</em>. His Lordship observed at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    The decision
                                [<em>ie Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank
                                Ltd</em> [1979] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 142] was followed by the
                            Supreme Court of Ireland in <em>In re Keenan Bros
                                Ltd</em> [1986] BCLC 242 where the company purported to grant
                            its bank fixed charges over its present and future book debts. The
                            debenture prohibited the company from disposing of the book debts or
                            creating other charges over them without the consent of the bank. It
                            allowed the company to collect the book debts, but required it to pay
                            the proceeds into a designated account with the bank from which the
                            company was not to make any withdrawals without the written consent of
                            the bank. In holding the charge to be a fixed charge, McCarthy J
                            presciently observed, at p 247:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“It is not suggested that mere terminology itself, such as
                            using the expression ‘fixed charge’, achieves the purpose;
                            one must look, not within the narrow confines of such term, not to the
                            declared intention of the parties alone, but to the effect of the
                            instruments whereby they purported to carry out that intention
                            ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The critical feature which led the court to characterise the charge on the
                        book debts as a fixed charge was that their proceeds were to be segregated
                        in a blocked account where they would be frozen and rendered unusable by the
                        company without the bank’s written consent. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    ... If the chargor is free to deal with the charged
                            assets and so withdraw them from the ambit of the charge without the
                            consent of the chargee, then the charge is a floating charge. But the
                            test can equally well be expressed from the chargee’s point of
                            view. If the charged assets are not under its control so that it can
                            prevent their dissipation without its consent, then the charge cannot be
                            a fixed charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Lord Millett also gave guidance on how a court
                    should decide whether a particular charge before it was a fixed charge or a
                    floating charge at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In deciding whether a charge is a fixed charge or a floating charge,
                        the court is engaged in a two-stage process. At the first stage it must
                        construe the instrument of charge and seek to gather the intentions of the
                        parties from the language they have used. But the object at this stage of
                        the process is not to discover whether the parties intended to create a
                        fixed or a floating charge. It is to ascertain the nature of the rights and
                        obligations which the parties intended to grant each other in respect of the
                        charged assets. Once these have been ascertained, the court can then embark
                        on the second stage of the process, which is one of categorisation. This is
                        a matter of law. It does not depend on the intention of the parties. If
                        their intention, properly gathered from the language of the instrument, is
                        to grant the company rights in respect of the charged assets which are
                        inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, then the charge cannot be a
                        fixed charge however they may have chosen to describe it. ... in construing
                        a debenture to see whether it creates a fixed or a floating charge, the only
                        intention which is relevant is the intention that the company should be free
                        to deal with the charged assets and withdraw them from the security without
                        the consent of the holder of the charge; or, to put the question another
                        way, whether the charged assets were intended to be under the control of the
                        company or of the charge holder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It can be easily discerned from the above
                    citations that the essential element in determining whether a charge is fixed or
                    floating is ascertaining whether the chargee or the charger is in control of the
                    asset concerned prior to the occurrence of an event of default. The House of
                    Lords in <em>In re Spectrum Plus Ltd (in liquidation)</em>
                    [2005] 2 AC 680 expressed similar views to those of Lord Millett in <em>Agnew</em>. Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe put the position
                    particularly succinctly at [138] and [139] of his judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">138    This passage brings us close to the issue of legal
                            principle, that is the essential difference between a fixed charge and a
                            floating charge. Under a fixed charge the assets charged as security are
                            permanently appropriated to the payment of the sum charged, in such a
                            way as to give the chargee a proprietary interest in the assets. So long
                            as the charge remains unredeemed, the assets can be released from the
                            charge only with the active concurrence of the chargee...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    Under a floating charge, by contrast, the chargee
                            does not have the same power to control the security for its own
                            benefit...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I turn now to look at the Security Documents.
                    Each of the Debenture, the Deed of Assignment and the Mortgage expressly
                    prohibits and restricts JDD from disposing of the charged assets or removing
                    them from the security without the consent of M+W. In cl 7.2 of the
                    Debenture, JDD undertook that it would not, except as permitted by the clause,
                    sell, transfer, execute any conveyance, lease or assignment of, or other right
                    to use or occupy or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the charged
                    property. It also agreed not to create any legal or equitable interest in any
                    part of the charged property. Similarly by cl 10.1 of the same document,
                    JDD was prohibited from, without M+W’s prior written consent, withdrawing
                    or transferring the proceeds of the realisation of any “Monetary
                    Claims” made by it. Finally, in cl 13.16, JDD warranted that it had
                    not sold or disposed of and would not sell or dispose of any of its rights,
                    title and interest in the Data Centre or any of the assets subject to the
                    Debenture. Similar restrictions on the disposal of the assigned assets charged
                    by the Deed of Assignment were contained in cl 6.3 of that document. As for
                    the Mortgage, it contained a specific covenant (cl 5.9) on the part of JDD not
                    to sell, transfer, lease, let out or licence the property or agree to do any of
                    the foregoing in respect of the same without M + W’s prior
                consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The restrictions contained in the Security
                    Documents unambiguously establish that JDD did not have the freedom to dispose
                    of the property or the GST Refund or to remove the same from the security
                    provided to M+W. In these circumstances, an essential characteristic of a
                    floating charge was not present in relation to the charges created by the
                    Security Documents. Accordingly, the documents created fixed charges. Although
                    the nomenclature used is not conclusive, the fact remains that these charges
                    were described as being “fixed” in cl 3.1 of the Debenture
                    and it appears that the original intention was to create charges of that nature.
                    In fact, the parties were able to give effect to such intention as is shown by
                    the various clauses that deprived JDD of the right to control the charged
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I also agree with M+W’s submission that
                    any dealings by JDD in breach of the restrictions would not change the nature of
                    the charge from fixed to floating. As long as M+W did not consent to JDD’s
                    non-observance of any restriction or waive any breach which it subsequently
                    discovered, JDD would not be able to rely on its own wrong to convert a fixed
                    charge into a floating charge. There was no allegation made by JDD of such
                    consent, waiver or acquiescence and thus, however JDD may have acted, its
                    actions could not affect the nature of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In this connection, I do not think that there
                    is any substance in JDD’s argument that the charge over the property was
                    not a fixed charge because its directors and management continued to deal with
                    the licence in respect of the property by, for example, paying rent to JTC. The
                    payments that JDD made to JTC were not in my view a form of dealing with the
                    licence that was in any way adverse to the charge over the property or the
                    interest of M+W therein. These payments were required under the building
                    agreement and were necessary to maintain JDD’s rights and interest (and
                    consequently M+W’s rights and interest) in that agreement. In fact, JDD
                    was required as part of its obligations under the Security Documents to ensure
                    that the security was maintained properly and this meant making sure that it did
                    not fail to make payments due to JTC. Such actions could have no effect on the
                    nature of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In a further attempt to show that JDD retained
                    control of the property, Mr Leow alleged that JDD had entered into lease
                    arrangements with third party tenants and that such arrangements were concluded
                    in breach of the prohibitions in the Security Documents. There is, however, no
                    assertion that M+W knew of or acquiesced in JDD’s conduct. Breaches on the
                    part of JDD cannot, as I have stated above, change the nature of the charge. In
                    any event, as M+W remind me, under s 23 of the Conveyancing and Law of
                    Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed), a mortgagor in possession may lease the
                    property, provided that the lease does not exceed three years, at the best rent
                    that can reasonably be obtained. Therefore, the fact that JDD may have entered
                    into lease arrangements would not <em>per se</em> be
                    inconsistent with M+W having a fixed charge rather than a floating
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Moving on to the GST Refund, the Receivers
                    submit that those moneys were the subject of a fixed charge. Under cl 3.1
                    of the Debenture, all Monetary Claims were charged to M+W by way of first fixed
                    charge. They say that the GST Refund constitutes a “Monetary
                    Claim” as that term is defined in cl 1.1 the Debenture. The clause
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>“Claims Account”</u> means an
                        Account to be identified by the Chargee (and any renewal or re-designation
                        of such account) maintained by the Chargor with any bank in Singapore into
                        which, inter alia, the proceeds of the getting in or realisation of the
                        Monetary Claims and the dividends, interest and other monies arising from
                        the Shares are to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>“Monetary Claims”</u> means any
                        book and other debts, monetary claims, credit sales receivables and other
                        receivables owing to the Chargor and any proceeds thereof (including any
                        claims or sums of money deriving from or in relation to any Intellectual
                        Property, any Investment, the proceeds of any Insurance Policy, any court
                        order, award or judgment, any contract or agreement to which the Chargor is
                        a party and any other assets, property, rights or undertaking of the
                        Chargor).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Book debts are debts that arise in the
                    ordinary course of business of a company. The GST Refund was paid to JDD
                    pursuant to a GST Return which it had filed stating that it had paid out more
                    GST than it had in fact received. Under the relevant legislation, JDD was
                    entitled to a refund from the Comptroller of GST in respect of the excess GST
                    paid out. The Receivers argue, and I agree, that this meant that JDD had a book
                    debt or receivable owing to it by the Comptroller of GST since GST is a tax
                    incurred in the ordinary course of business when goods and services are supplied
                    by a business. I therefore agree that the GST Refund clearly fell within the
                    definition of a Monetary Claim in the Debenture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Under cl 10.1(a) of the Debenture, JDD
                    was obliged, on receipt of a Monetary Claim, to pay the same into the Claims
                    Account. This meant that all of the GST Refund had to be paid into the Claims
                    Account and that JDD had no authority to deal with such moneys in any other
                    fashion. In particular, cl 10.1 prohibited JDD from factoring or
                    discounting any claim for the GST Refund or withdrawing or transferring any of
                    the GST Refund in the Claims Account. Under cl 10.2, JDD was obliged to
                    provide to the bank which held the Claims Account with an irrevocable payment
                    instruction to transfer the money in the account to M+W on each due date. This
                    clause clearly evidences the parties’ intention that all moneys in the
                    Claims Account including the GST Refund were to be applied in repaying the
                    amounts due to M+W. All in all, the terms of cl 10 of the Debenture make it
                    plain that the parties intended to ensure that JDD used all Monetary Claims
                    (including therefore the GST Refund) for the purpose of repaying M+W and had no
                    authority to use them for any other purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the event, JDD breached its obligations
                    under the Debenture. It did not pay the GST Refund into a designated Claims
                    Account but instead deposited the money into an account with DBS Bank
                    (“the DBS account”) which it was able to operate as it saw fit
                    without any restrictions imposed under the Debenture. As I have stated above,
                    the breach by JDD of its obligation to deal with Monetary Claims in a particular
                    fashion cannot convert the fixed charge over the Monetary Claims into a floating
                    one. Accordingly, simply paying the GST Refund into the DBS account could not
                    procure its release from the fixed charge and as the Receivers argue, such
                    action resulted in JDD holding the GST Refund on a constructive trust for M+W.
                    This result is supported by the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Barclays Bank plc v Willowbrook International Ltd</em> (The
                    Times, 5 February 1987) which held that where moneys secured by a fixed
                    charge are utilised in a manner contrary to the fixed charge, the moneys will be
                    held on a constructive trust for the beneficiary of the security. It is also
                    pertinent that cl 10.1(a) of the Debenture provided that until a Monetary
                    Claim that JDD had received was paid into the Claims Account it was to be held
                    upon trust by JDD for M+W. Thus, the parties expressly contemplated and provided
                    for the imposition of a trust on any Monetary Claims held by JDD outside the
                    Claims Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There is one further point in relation to the
                    GST Refund. After the money was deposited into the DBS account, other sums of
                    money were also deposited into this account, including a deposit of $82,666.78
                    made on 28 January 2010 and a further deposit of $114,918 made on
                    10 March 2010. When the Receivers took control of the DBS account, the
                    balance in the account was only $1,107,816.58. The question that arises is
                    whether all of this money should be attributed to the GST Refund or whether that
                    balance also includes portions of the other sums deposited into the DBS account.
                    The position taken by the Receivers is that JDD is deemed to have used all other
                    non-trust moneys in the DBS account before any of the GST Refund which was held
                    on trust should be taken to have been dissipated. This position would apply
                    regardless of whether the other moneys were credited to the DBS account after
                    the GST Refund was credited as the “first in, first out” rule
                        <em>ie</em> what is known as the rule in <em>Clayton’s Case</em> [1816] 1 Mer 572 (“<em>Clayton’s Case</em>”) does not apply to the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Receivers submitted that the “first
                    in, first out” rule does not apply when the moneys in a bank account are
                    a mixture of trust funds and private moneys. This was established in <em>In re Hallett’s Estate. Knatchbull v Hallett</em>
                    [1879–80] 13 Ch D 696. The court there held that if a person who holds
                    money as a trustee or in a fiduciary character pays it into an account with his
                    bankers, and mixes it with his own money, and afterwards draws out sums by
                    cheques in the ordinary manner, the rule in <em>Clayton’s
                        Case</em> does not apply and the drawer must be taken to have drawn
                    out his own money in preference to the trust money. This holding was applied by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and
                        Others</em> [2005] SGCA 4. It appears from that case that in deciding
                    whether trust or non-trust moneys are drawn out of a mixed fund by a trustee,
                    the court will avoid a presumption of a breach of trust. At [86] of its judgment, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If we were to apply the principle to the purchase of 39 Sheldon
                        Avenue, we would be presupposing that Mdm Lim was guilty of breach of trust,
                        a finding that AR Phang and Choo J explicitly refused to make and, as we
                        have said, rightly so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I agree that as the DBS account contained a
                    mix of the GST Refund which was held on trust and ordinary moneys belonging to
                    JDD, the rule in <em>Clayton’s Case</em> should not
                    apply. Therefore any withdrawals from the DBS account should be presumed to have
                    been first taken from the non-trust moneys. It would follow that the sum of
                    $$1,107,816.58 remaining in the DBS account when the Receivers took control of
                    it on 25 March 2010 was comprised entirely of the balance of the GST Refund
                    held on trust for M+W.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As I have determined that the charges in issue
                    created by the Security Documents are fixed charges and not floating charges,
                    there is no need for me to determine whether or not JDD was solvent at the time
                    of their creation. Section 330 of the Act therefore has no application in
                    the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     For the reasons given above, JDD’s
                    action against all the defendants fails and must be dismissed with costs. There
                    is no basis on which I can grant JDD the various declarations sought against
                    either the Receivers or M + W.</p>
