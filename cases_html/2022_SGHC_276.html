This is because the court is exercising its supervisory jurisdiction in hearing and determining an application to set aside an adjudication determination, or a judgment procured under s 27(1) of the SOPA to enforce the adjudication determination in the same manner as a judgment or an order of the court. The Court of Appeal explained as follows in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 797 (“<span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span>”) at [48]–[49]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 <span class="font-italic">Put simply, in hearing an application to set aside an [adjudication determination or “AD”] and/or a s 27 judgment, the court does not</span><span class="font-italic"> review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision</span>, and any setting aside must be premised on issues relating to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, a breach of natural justice or non-compliance with the SOPA. <span class="font-italic">Applications to se</span><span class="font-italic">t aside ADs and/or s 27 judgments are thus akin to judicial review proceedings, and are not appeals on the merits of the adjudicator’s decision</span>. In our judgment, it is consistent with the purpose of the SOPA, which is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry, that the court, in hearing such applications, does not review the merits of the AD in question. It may be noted that in keeping with its statutory purpose, the SOPA establishes that parties who have done work or supplied goods are entitled to payment as of right; it also sets out an intervening process of adjudication which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined. In other words, the adjudication regime under the SOPA seeks to achieve temporary finality: see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 The view that the court is exercising its supervisory jurisdiction when it hears an application to set aside an AD and/or a s 27 judgment is strengthened further when one considers that the court, in hearing such an application, is not solely concerned with the procedural propriety of the process by which the creditor obtained its s 27 leave order, such as whether the creditor made full and frank disclosure in its <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for the s 27 leave order. This is because focusing only on the procedural propriety of the process by which the creditor obtained its s 27 leave order would not address the real concern of the debtor, which is to set aside the underlying AD and/or the s 27 judgment entered pursuant to that AD.

One of the twin pillars of the rules of natural justice requires that each party must be given an adequate opportunity to be heard and to respond to the case raised by the other party (the “fair hearing rule”) (see <span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T </span><span class="font-italic">Corp</span> [2018] 2 SLR 532 (“<span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko</span>”) at [34]). One aspect of the fair hearing rule is the requirement that the adjudicator must receive both parties’ submissions and address important issues which are determinative of the outcome of a dispute (see <span class="font-italic">Metropole Pte Ltd v Designshop Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 4 SLR 277 at [57]; <span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko</span> at [40]–[43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Accordingly, an adjudicator will be found to have acted in breach of natural justice for failing to consider an important issue in a dispute before him if: (a) the issue was essential to the resolution of the dispute; and (b) a clear and virtually inescapable inference may be drawn that the adjudicator did not apply his mind to the said issue (see <span class="font-italic">Bintai Kindenko</span> at [46]). Element (a) is simple and clear. As for element (b), it is useful to explain that where the adjudicator fails to consider an important pleaded issue, the court can draw an inference that the adjudicator failed to address that issue, if the facts and circumstances clearly warrant it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The threshold for finding a breach of natural justice on this ground is a high one; the court should only infer that the adjudicator has failed to consider an important pleaded issue if such an inference was “clear and virtually inescapable” (see <span class="font-italic">Glaziers</span>, citing <span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) at [46]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glaziers</span> observed at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 … where the allegation is that the decision-maker has wholly failed to consider an important pleaded issue, the court must be especially careful. <span class="font-italic">It is often being invited to conclude, not from any “explicit indication” … but rather from the decision-maker’s silence on a submission that he has failed to even address his mind to that submission. Yet such silence may be equally consistent with the decision-maker considering the submission, but then choosing to disregard or reject it without explaining himself. The difficulty in drawing such an inference is that the decision-maker’s silence is inherently ambiguous</span>. … Given the ambiguities inherent in the decision-maker’s silence, <span class="font-italic">the court must be wary that a disaffected party may wrongly characterise what is, in truth, the decision-maker’s misunderstanding of or disagreement with a certain submission as a failure to consider that submission entirely</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The holding of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glaziers</span> is apposite. Where the adjudicator is alleged to have breached the fair hearing rule by failing to <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> consider a pleaded issue in the adjudication determination, the court must be wary of drawing an inference from the adjudicator’s “silence” that he or she has failed to consider the pleaded issue. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> held as follows at [46], albeit in the context of setting aside an arbitral award (but equally applicable to the context of setting aside an adjudication determination):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the facts are also consistent with the [adjudicator] simply <span class="font-italic">having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case</span>, or having been <span class="font-italic">mistaken as to the law</span>, or having <span class="font-italic">chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary</span> (notwithstanding that this view may have been formed based on a misunderstanding of the aggrieved party’s case), then the inference that the [adjudicator] did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be drawn.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 However, where the adjudicator’s failure to expressly consider a pleaded issue in the adjudication determination is based on the adjudicator’s misunderstanding of the complainant’s case, disagreement with the complainant’s submission, or an error of law, an inference should not be drawn that the adjudicator has failed to afford the complainant natural justice by not expressly considering the pleaded issue (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [47]; see also <span class="font-italic">Bintai Ki</span><span class="font-italic">ndenko</span> at [47]). Natural justice only requires that the parties be heard; it does not require that the parties be given responses on all submissions made (see <span class="font-italic">Range Construction Pte Ltd v Goldbell Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2021] 2 SLR 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Range </span><span class="font-italic">Construction</span>”) at [75], citing <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span>”) at [60]).

</div> Thus, the Adjudicator was also not satisfied that the Applicant had, by its conduct, committed a repudiatory breach of the Sub-Contract under common law, or a breach of the terms of the Sub-Contract. It follows that the Adjudicator was of the view that there was no basis to terminate the Sub-Contract, whether under common law or contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Clause 5.10.1. That was why the Adjudicator stated in the Adjudication Determination in paragraph 101 that he had “determined the termination not to be valid”.

This would have rendered the Applicant’s service of PC 25 invalid under s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA. The invocation of the Payment Suspension Provision is dependent on the Respondent’s termination of the Sub-Contract “for default and/or repudiatory breach under general law”. In other words, from the moment the Respondent terminates the Sub-Contract under either the Termination Provision “for default” or under common law for “repudiatory breach”, the Applicant would not be entitled to serve any payment claim on the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 At this juncture, I note that the Applicant has argued comprehensively and extensively that even if the Payment Suspension Provision was operative, it would have been invalid and unenforceable for being in violation of the SOPA, particularly ss 9, 17(3) and 36(2) of the SOPA. In brief, the Applicant’s case is that the Payment Suspension Provision permits the Respondent to withhold certification and payment of any progress payment claims filed by the Applicant, following the Respondent’s termination of the Sub-Contract. This is on the basis that the Respondent has not yet ascertained the costs of completing and remedying any defects, damages for delay and other loss or expense incurred, as the plain language of the Payment Suspension Provision alludes to. This, the Applicant submits, allows the Respondent to effectively evade the requirements under s 17(3) of the SOPA, namely that any damage, loss or expense indicated in a payment claim or payment response must be supported by documentation, failing which the adjudicator is entitled to disregard that claim. The Applicant thus argues that such a circumvention of the requirements under s 17(3) of the SOPA should be rendered void under s 36(2) of the SOPA.

</div> For the Adjudicator to conclude that the Payment Suspension Provision did not apply, he must have considered that the conditions for invoking that provision were not met, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Respondent had not validly terminated the Sub-Contract, amongst others, under the Termination Provision. It, therefore, follows that the Adjudicator would have applied his mind to consider the Respondent’s arguments on the issue relating to the Respondent’s entitlement to terminate the Sub-Contract under the Termination Provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Therefore, the Adjudicator has not wholly ignored and failed to consider the Respondent’s reliance on Clause 5.10.1 as an alternative ground for terminating the Sub-Contract. Indeed, the Adjudicator’s analysis in the Adjudication Determination suggests that he was aware of the Respondent’s argument on the termination of the Applicant’s employment under the Sub-Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The true substance of the Respondent’s complaint lies in its grievance that the Adjudicator had found that the Respondent had wrongfully terminated the Sub-Contract under common law and the Termination Provision. The Respondent’s basis for alleging a breach of natural justice is, fundamentally, its disagreement with the Adjudicator’s decision on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Whether the Adjudicator was correct in his analysis on this point is beside the point. As I have held at [23] above, even an error of law committed by the Adjudicator is not a ground for finding a breach of natural justice. It is not the prerogative of the Court to review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision when hearing an application to set aside an adjudication determination. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) emphasised in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41], the court’s role in deciding a setting-aside application cannot be “to look into the parties’ arguments before the adjudicator and determine whether the adjudicator arrived at the correct decision”. A complete review of the adjudication determination would unduly prolong the process before a dispute relating to a payment claim is finally disposed of. This will prolong the payment disputes and will be expensive. Further, the review of the adjudication determination is inconsistent with the purpose of the SOPA which is to facilitate cash flow, a vital feed in the building and construction industry, by according speedy interim relief. Any party who is dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s decision, can always avail itself to the full suite of the court procedure if it so decides.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I accept the Applicant’s submission that the proper recourse for the Respondent is to apply for an adjudication review under s 18 of the SOPA,

It also follows that the appointment of an adjudicator under s 14(1) of the SOPA in such an adjudication application would be invalid.

</div> In support, the Respondent seeks to analogise the present case with the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One Residential Pte Ltd v Dong Cheng Construction Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 791 (“<span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span>, Orion-One Residential Pte Ltd (“Orion”), the developer of a condominium project, engaged Dong Cheng Construction Pte Ltd (“Dong Cheng”) as the main contractor for the project. The main contract between Dong Cheng and Orion incorporated the <span class="font-italic">REDAS Design &amp; Build Conditions of Main Contract</span> (Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore, 3rd Ed, July 2013) (“REDAS Conditions”) which contained clause 30.3, the effects of termination for default. I shall elaborate on clause 30.3 below. Orion eventually terminated Dong Cheng’s employment as the main contractor of the project. Slightly more than two years later, Dong Cheng served a payment claim on Orion, which Orion disputed. Dong Cheng then lodged an adjudication application in respect of the payment claim. The adjudicator in that case found, amongst others, that Dong Cheng was entitled to serve the payment claim despite the payment claim being served after Dong Cheng’s employment had been terminated. The High Court found that Dong Cheng’s payment claim was valid, and thus dismissed Orion’s application to set aside the adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On appeal, Dong Cheng submitted that its right to serve a payment claim post-termination was prescribed by cl 30.3.1 of the REDAS Conditions (“Clause 30.3.1”). Clause 30.3.1 states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">30.3.    Effects of Termination for Default</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event of the termination of the employment of the Contractor under clause 30.2,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30.3.1. the Employer shall not be liable to make any further payments to the Contractor until such time when the costs of the design, execution and completion of the incomplete Works, rectification costs for remedying any defects, liquidated damages for delay and all other costs incurred by the Employer as a result of the termination has been ascertained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that Clause 30.3.1 was only applicable if Dong Cheng’s employment was terminated under clause 30.2. This was not the case; Dong Cheng’s employment was instead terminated under clause 2.5 of the supplementary agreement between Dong Cheng and Orion. Thus, Clause 30.3.1 was not applicable, and Dong Cheng was not entitled to rely on Clause 30.3.1 to serve its payment claim (see <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Court of Appeal commented, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that Clause 30.3.1 of the REDAS Conditions concerned the final settlement of accounts between the parties in the event that the contractor was terminated by the employer for breach of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [33] and [34]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33     It is apparent from [Clause 30.3.1] that any payment payable by the employer thereunder is conditioned upon the ascertainment of all costs incurred by the employer as a result of the termination. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34     Based on the language of [Clause 30.3.1], the costs referred to therein (“the Termination Costs”) do not only refer to the costs that have actually been expended by the employer post-termination (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the costs of engaging another contractor to complete the works). <span class="font-italic">It also includes any damages that are due to the employer as a result of the termination of the contractor’s employment. In other words, the Termination Costs encompass not only the costs required to bring the project to completion but also any sums that the contractor is legally liable to pay to the employer as a result of its breach of contract</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, Clause 30.3.1 was concerned with Orion’s payment to Dong Cheng after ascertaining all the costs incurred by Orion as a result of its termination of Dong Cheng’s employment <span class="font-italic">and</span> any damages that are due to Orion as a result of the termination of Dong Cheng’s employment (the “Termination Costs”). Payments made pursuant to Clause 30.3.1, which factors into account the Termination Costs, could not be viewed as progress payments as they are not concerned solely with the value of the works done but also sums that the contractor is legally liable to pay to the employer as a result of its breach of contract (<span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [34]). The Court of Appeal thus concluded that Dong Cheng’s payment claim did not fall within the ambit of the SOPA. Any payment claimed under Clause 30.3.1 concerns the final settlement of accounts between the parties in the event that the contractor’s employment is terminated by the employer for breach of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> at [38] and [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the present case, the Respondent seeks to analogise Clause 30.3.1 in <span class="font-italic">Orion</span><span class="font-italic">-One</span> with the Payment Suspension Provision. The Respondent submits that since PC 25 was served following the Applicant’s termination of its employment under the Sub-Contract, it follows that PC 25 was served pursuant to the Payment Suspension Provision. That meant that PC 25 was a claim for the final settlement of accounts between the Applicant and the Respondent following the termination of the Applicant’s employment under the Sub-Contract.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The language of Clause 30.3.1 in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One </span>may appear similar to the Payment Suspension Provision in the present case. However, I cannot accept the Respondent’s submissions. The Payment Suspension Provision applied only in the event of the termination of the Applicant’s employment under the Sub-Contract (see [34] above). And as I have accepted above, the Adjudicator determined that the Respondent had wrongfully terminated the Sub-Contract (see [30] above). Thus, the Payment Suspension Provision was not operative. Therefore, the final settlement of accounts as prescribed by the Payment Suspension Provision could not have been initiated. Hence, PC 25 cannot possibly be a claim for the final settlement of accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I accept the Applicant’s submission that its right to serve PC 25 is founded on clause 5.1.1 of the LOA (“Clause 5.1.1”).

Section 2 of the SOPA defines “progress payment” as including “a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a contract, and includes … a single or one-off payment (<span class="font-italic">including a final payment</span>)” [emphasis added]. Sections 5 and 6 of the SOPA further provide that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entitlement to progress payments</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5</span>. Any person who has carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or services, under a contract is entitled to a progress payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount of progress payment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6</span>. The amount of a progress payment to which a person is entitled under a contract is —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the amount calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) if the contract does not contain such provision, the amount calculated on the basis of the value of the construction work carried out, or of the goods or services supplied, by the person under the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> observed at [40], the statutory framework defines a claim for progress payments as “payments predicated upon and directly linked to the carrying out of construction work or the supplying of goods or services under a contract. The quantum of such payment depends on the terms of the contract, or the value of the work carried out or of the goods or services supplied.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is clear that Clause 5.1.1 largely mirrors progress payments as defined in the SOPA. The amounts of such progress payments are determined through the process of periodic valuation of the works or part thereof carried out by the contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In this case, PC 25 which was made pursuant to Clause 5.1.1 was concerned only with the Applicant’s claim for work done in respect of the Project as prescribed under the Sub-Contract before the Respondent terminated the Sub-Contract.

</div> Indeed, nothing on the facts showed that at the time PC 25 was served, the Respondent had ascertained all the costs which it had incurred under the Payment Suspension Provision. I am thus satisfied that PC 25 is merely a final claim for progress payment that falls within the SOPA regime, instead of a claim for the value of works less any costs and deductions prescribed under the Payment Suspension Provision. I, therefore, reject the Respondent’s characterisation of PC 25 as a claim for the final settlement of accounts between the Applicant and the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In summary, I find that the Respondent has not made out any ground for its Setting-Aside Application:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, I am satisfied that the Adjudicator had not breached the rules of natural justice as the Respondent has not proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Adjudicator had failed to consider the Respondent’s alternative ground for terminating the Sub-Contract under Clause 5.10.1 of the LOA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Termination Provision. A thorough perusal of the Adjudication Determination shows that the Adjudicator was aware of the two alternative grounds of termination that the Respondent relied upon, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, under the common law and under the Termination Provision. The factual basis for these two grounds is the same. The parties had comprehensively argued these grounds before the Adjudicator. The mere fact that the Adjudicator did not expressly mention that the Respondent was not entitled to terminate the Sub-Contract based on Clause 5.10.1 is insufficient to sustain the allegation that the Adjudicator had failed to consider an important pleaded issue. Therefore, the Adjudicator had not failed to apply his mind to consider the merits of the Respondent’s case for terminating the Sub-Contract under Clause 5.10.1. The true grievance of the Respondent is that it disagreed with the Adjudicator’s finding that the Respondent had wrongly terminated the Sub-Contract. This is not a valid basis for setting aside the Adjudication Determination. It is not the role of the Court to review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision when hearing an application to set aside an adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I also find that the Applicant has validly served PC 25 on the Respondent. Whether the Applicant was entitled to serve PC 25 turned on whether the Sub-Contract was validly terminated, such that the Payment Suspension Provision and s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA precluded the Applicant from serving any payment claim. The Adjudicator has found that PC 25 was validly served. This determination on the merits is one which the Court is not entitled to review. Accordingly, the Respondent’s submission on this ground amounts to an impermissible backdoor attempt to review the merits of the underlying dispute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the Respondent had validly terminated the Sub-Contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, I accept that PC 25 was not a claim for the final settlement of accounts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a claim for the value of works done by the Applicant less any deductions or claims prescribed under the Payment Suspension Provision. The fact that the Applicant had served PC 25 following the Respondent’s purported termination of the Sub-Contract does not automatically render PC 25 a claim for the final settlement of accounts. It is still necessary to examine the substance of PC 25. In this case, I am satisfied that PC 25 was merely a progress payment claim made under Clause 5.1.1. The Respondent’s reliance on analogising the present case with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span> is flawed and based on a misreading of the Court of Appeal’s observations therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I, therefore, dismiss the Respondent’s application to set aside the Adjudication Determination and the Order of Court.
