However, if the majority shareholder has made such a buyout offer to the minority shareholder and the latter does not accept the offer, is it then open to the majority shareholder to strike out the minority shareholder’s claim of minority oppression and relief thereunder? In HC/SUM 1507/2022 (“Summons 1507”), this was what the second to fourth defendants sought to do in applying under Order 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court 2014 (“ROC 2014”) for the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”) in HC/S 915/2021 (“Suit 915”) to be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Suit 915 is a claim of minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) brought by the plaintiff Mr Daniel Kroll (“Mr Kroll”).

In their second and third prayers, the second to fourth defendants ask (in the alternative) that specific paragraphs in the SOC be struck out, either on the ground that they are frivolous or vexatious, or that they would prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I heard parties on 5 July 2022. After the hearing, parties wrote in on 8 July (the plaintiff), 15 July (the second to fourth defendants) and 18 July (the first defendant), to make what essentially amounted to further submissions. Having considered the oral and written submissions of parties, I decline to allow the application for striking out. While the buyout offer is reasonable, there is no abuse of process as the offer has not covered all the disputed issues and / or all reliefs sought in Suit 915; and it was reasonable for Mr Kroll to have proceeded with the action in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In respect of paragraphs 57 to 59 of the SOC (Amendment No. 1), I am of the view that the pleadings therein are somewhat clumsily drafted, but that the defects are not such as to warrant my striking them out at this interlocutory stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In respect of paragraphs 55 and 56 of the SOC (Amendment No. 1), I find the pleadings therein to be legally unsustainable, and the defects are such that I do not think they can be improved with amendment.

According to Mr Wong, this included pressuring Mr Wong to transfer additional shares to him without consideration. Mr Kroll had procured these shares by <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>refusing to transfer back all of Mr Wong’s shares which he had hitherto held in trust, and also by threatening to report to MAS various alleged misrepresentations which would have compromised CTX’s ability to obtain the MAS licenses. While Mr Kroll had tried to rationalise the transfer of the additional shares as a revaluation of his initial investment sum, this went far beyond any such revaluation, as he also wanted more free shares to match the “sweat equity” allocated to a senior employee in February 2021 – and this despite promptly resigning as director at end-February 2021 without having provided any “sweat” for the additional free shares.

</div> In the alternative, Mr Wong seeks specific performance by way of the transfer back to him of 257,240 such shares (then 4.43% of CTX) from Mr Kroll.  According to Mr Wong, these additional shares were transferred to Mr Kroll on the basis that they constituted “sweat equity”, and were subject to the condition subsequent that Mr Kroll would actively participate in and contribute towards the development of CTX’s service offerings and the sourcing of additional funding and capital.  Since Mr Kroll failed to do any of these things after receiving the shares, he became disentitled to these shares.

</div> Under the main proposal (“the Buyout Offer”), the notional percentage of Mr Kroll’s CTX shares is fixed at 7.67%. The quantum of the purchase price is derived using a formula of this percentage of shares multiplied by the “Company Value”. The “Company Value” would be determined by an Assessor, excluding matters deriving from the 30 April 2021 EGM that formed the consideration for the issuance of shares (which matters Mr Kroll has characterised as unfair dilution events). The date of valuation is the date of the impugned EGM – <span class="font-italic">ie </span>30 April 2021. The buy-out value is purely <span class="font-italic">pro rata</span>, with no “loss of marketability” discount on account of a minority shareholding stake. The Assessor is to be jointly appointed within a reasonable time of acceptance of the proposal (to be agreed) and should have a minimal qualification of 10 years in the field of forensic accounting with experience in company valuations as an expert in Court or arbitration proceedings. The cost of the Assessor and Assessment process should be borne equally by each side, and the parties should bear their own legal costs.

</div> Dr Bai highlights the following matters which he says support his view.  On 8 November 2021, Mr Kroll filed a generally-endorsed Writ of Summons without an SOC: the second to fourth Defendants contend that he did so as a “scare tactic”, to show he was prepared to go to court and to broadcast his accusations. The second to fourth Defendants take the view that Mr Kroll did not file a SOC when he filed the writ because had he done so, his allegations would be revealed in publicly accessible pleadings and the threat would be spent.

The Law Commission (paragraphs 3.57-62) has recommended a statutory presumption that in cases to which the presumption of unfairly prejudicial conduct applies, the fair value of the shares should be determined on a pro rata basis. This too reflects the existing practice. This is not to say that there may not be cases in which it will be fair to take a discounted value. But such cases will be based upon special circumstances and it will seldom be possible for the court to say that an offer to buy on a discounted basis is plainly reasonable, so that the petition should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Secondly, the value, if not agreed, should be determined by a competent expert.</span> The offer in this case to appoint an accountant agreed by the parties or in default nominated by the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants satisfied this requirement.

The objective should be economy and expedition, even if this carries the possibility of a rough edge for one side or the other (and both parties in this respect take the same risk) compared with a more elaborate procedure. This is in accordance with the terms of the draft Regulation 119: Exit Right recommended by the Law Commission: see Appendix C to the report, p. 133.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fourthly, the offer should, as in this case, provide for equality of arms between the parties.</span> Both should have the same right of access to information about the company which bears upon the value of the shares and both should have the right to make submissions to the expert, though the form (written or oral) which these submissions may take should be left to the discretion of the expert himself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fifthly, there is the question of costs.</span> In the present case, when the offer was made after nearly three years of litigation, it could not serve as an independent ground for dismissing the petition, on the assumption that it was otherwise well founded, without an offer of costs. But this does not mean that payment of costs need always be offered. If there is a breakdown in relations between the parties, the majority shareholder should be given a reasonable opportunity to make an offer (which may include time to explore the question of how to raise finance) before he becomes obliged to pay costs. As I have said, the unfairness does not usually consist merely in the fact of the breakdown but in failure to make a suitable offer. And the majority shareholder should have a reasonable time to make the offer before his conduct is treated as unfair. The mere fact that the petitioner has presented his petition before the offer does not mean that the respondent must offer to pay the costs if he was not given a reasonable time. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Applying their proposed 3-stage framework, the second to fourth Defendants submit that first, the Buyout Offer satisfies the <span class="font-italic">O’Neill </span>guidelines.

They brought a petition under s 216 of the CA, alleging that the defendants (the majority shareholders) had conducted the affairs of Borden in a manner which was oppressive to them and / or which disregarded their interests as members of Borden. While the High Court dismissed the claim on grounds that the minority oppression claim was not made out, the court took the view (at [102]) that the plaintiffs - in choosing to continue with the action instead of responding to the buyout offer - were guilty of an abuse of process.  In reaching that conclusion, the court found that the offer substantially met the <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span> guidelines. The defendants’ solicitors had written in 11 days after the commencement of the action to state that the defendants were willing to purchase the plaintiffs’ shares pursuant to a valuation by a professional valuer to be agreed upon between the parties (at [95]). The plaintiffs had declined to discuss the mechanics of valuation or any details of the valuation or offer. The court noted that if they had responded in a positive way, these issues could have formed part of the negotiations, and the court could have made a decision on the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">points on which parties were unable to agree (at [98]).</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 After judgment was handed down, the defendants made a similar buyout offer to the plaintiffs, who rejected the offer and appealed against the High Court’s decision: <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Khiang and anor v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and o</span><span class="font-italic">thers </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Khiang CA</span>”) at [9].

The CA held that the appeal was not an abuse of process as the buyout offer was not a reasonable one: it did not include the damages claimed by the plaintiffs arising from the defendants’ oppressive acts.

</div>
</div> the High Court held that the two buyout offers made to the plaintiff were not reasonable. The first offer proposed only a partial buyout of a smaller parcel of 93,085 shares, and did not deal with the plaintiff’s pending claim (at [214]). As for the second offer, it did not satisfy the requirement that the shares be purchased at fair value (at [215]) because it was not expressly stated in the offer that “the fair value would be ascertained without applying the minority discount”. The second offer also did not contain any offer to pay the plaintiff’s legal costs, which had been incurred over the course of the six years during which the action had proceeded; and the plaintiff would still have to go through the trial process to determine his right to costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Further, the High Court was not satisfied that the procedure for valuation set out in both offers would suffice to determine the fair value of the plaintiff’s shares: a trial would have been required to determine various issues in dispute which affected the value of the shares. These included issues such as the validity of the allotment of some four million shares to another company, MDG, as well as the wrongful payment of legal fees. Lastly, apart from considering the <span class="font-italic">O’Neill </span>guidelines, the court noted <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(at [218]) </span>that the second offer had been made at the eleventh hour, and the plaintiff “<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">could hardly be expected to give up six years of litigation on the eve of trial on the basis of such an offer”.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">English cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Turning to English caselaw, we find – even prior to <span class="font-italic">O’Neil</span><span class="font-italic">l – </span>a number of English authorities which dealt with applications to strike out unfair prejudice petitions on the basis that a buyout offer had been made offering the petitioner all the relief which he/she could reasonably expect to obtain at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 <span class="font-italic">Re a Company No. 00836 of 1995 </span>[1996] BCC 432 concerned a motion to strike out a petition under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 on the basis that an offer had been made to purchase the petitioner’s shares which would give the petitioner all the relief he could realistically expect to obtain on his petition, and that it would be an abuse of the process of court for him to continue with the petition. The case arose out of a long-running dispute between a father, Mr Albert Thompson (“AT”), and one of his two sons, Julian Thompson (“JT”). The company, which was the subject matter of the application, Gippeswyk Investment Co Ltd (“GICL”), was incorporated in 1960; and in 1962, AT acquired all 200 issued shares in the company in exchange for land which he put into the company. Of the 200 shares, AT held 50 shares, with his two sons holding the remaining shares equally. The falling out between JT and his father, AT, led to JT effectively taking over GICL together with his brother, John. This also precipitated the long running feud between father and son in which numerous lawsuits were filed. Insofar as GICL was concerned, AT commenced the present action when John purported to sell his shares in GICL to JT. AT applied to set aside the purported sale, and also issued a minority shareholder’s petition under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 alleging that GICL’s affairs were being conducted in a way that was prejudicial to his interests. In response, JT applied to strike out his father’s application under s 459 on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action and / or was an abuse of process of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Justice Weeks QC (“Weeks J”), who heard the case, allowed the striking-out application. He reasoned that it was almost inevitable that the majority shareholder, JT, would be ordered to buy out his father’s shares in the event that his father’s petition succeeded. Weeks J observed that cases where a majority shareholder was forced to sell his shareholding to the petitioning minority shareholder must be very rare: in the present case, the circumstances were not so exceptional as to make that a realistic possibility, especially since AT had for the past four years taken no active part in managing the company. As a minority shareholder, AT had no effective way of stopping the unfair treatment which he complained of. Weeks J therefore struck out AT’s petition on the basis that an offer had been made which realistically gave AT everything he could expect to obtain if he succeeded in his action (at pp 442 – 443). Weeks J rejected AT’s argument that he was entitled to have his day in court and that it would be inappropriate to have matters relating to the valuation of shares in the offer presented decided by an accountant rather than the court (at pp 441 – 442). Instead, Weeks J took the view that there was “great sense in avoiding a day in court and referring the matter, which was ultimately a matter of valuation” to an accountant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In <span class="font-italic">Re a Company No. 006834 of 1988</span> (1989) 5 BCC 218, the company was in the business of organising ski holidays in Savoie. It was started in 1978 by the respondent, Kramer, and one Guyatt. Kramer held two-thirds of the share capital with Guyatt holding the remaining one-third. In 1986, Guyatt decided to sever his connections with the company and sold his shares to the petitioner, Kay. Unfortunately for both Kramer and Kay, the business association was unsuccessful, and they agreed that the company should be dissolved. Kay made various complaints against Kramer, alleging, amongst other things that he had charged personal expenses to the company and allowed members of his family and friends to have holidays at the company’s expense. Kramer’s solicitors wrote to Kay with an open offer to buy his shares in the company at open market value, to be determined by an independent valuer jointly appointed by the parties. This offer supposedly went further than the common form pre-emption provision in the company’s articles which provided that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“A member desiring to transfer shares otherwise than to a person who is already a member of the company shall give notice in writing of such intention to the directors of the company, giving particulars of the shares in question. The directors as agents for the member giving such notice may dispose of such shares or any of them to members of the company at a price to be agreed between the transferor and the directors or failing agreement at a price fixed by the auditors of the company as the fair value thereof.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Kay brought a petition pursuant to s 459 of the Companies Act 1985, seeking an order that Kramer sell his shares to him, or alternatively, that he be ordered to buy Kay’s shares. In response, Kramer applied to strike out the petition on the ground that having regard to the provision of the company’s articles and the open offer, the presentation of the petition was an abuse of the court’s process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In allowing the striking out application, Hoffmann J (as he then was) summarised the applicable principle as follows (at 220). When it is “plain that the appropriate solution to a breakdown of relations is for the petitioner to be able to sell his shares at a fair price, and the articles contain provisions for determining a price which the respondent is willing to pay or the respondent has offered to submit to an independent determination of a fair price, the presentation or maintenance of a petition under s 459 will ordinarily be an abuse of process. Hoffmann J opined that it would be very unusual for the court to order a majority shareholder who was actively involved in the company’s management to sell his shares to the minority shareholder when he was willing and able to buy out the minority shareholder at a fair price. While it was possible that the court could make such an order, the present situation was not such a case. Hoffmann J also rejected (at 221) Kay’s argument that the offer would not give him all the relief sought in the petition given his allegations of improper application of the company’s funds. Notably, Hoffmann J held that<span class="font-italic"> it </span><span class="font-italic">was only in cases of impropriety by the respondent which had affected the value of the shares that it would be inappropriate for the matter to be dealt with by a straightforward valuation in an offer. On the present facts, the effect of the alleged improprieties on the valuation of shares in the company was likely to be minimal</span>. Further, the valuer would be concerned with applying a suitable multiple to the profits which the company might earn in the future; and Kramer had said that the valuer could take into account any sums which he considered to have been improperly disbursed. As for the objection that the independent valuer’s terms of reference did not prevent him from applying a discount to reflect Kay’s minority holding, Hoffmann J was of the view that in valuing the shares, the valuer was entitled to fix a value reflecting the involuntariness of the purchase as well as the involuntariness of the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">North Holdings Ltd v Southern Tropics Ltd and others </span>[1999] 2 BCLC 625 (“<span class="font-italic">North Holdings</span>”), in a decision delivered shortly after the judgement by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span>, the English CA allowed an appeal by the appellant N Ltd against the lower court’s order striking out the appellant’s petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985.  In its petition, the appellant – who was the minority shareholder in a company S Ltd – had alleged that it was being unfairly prejudiced by the respondent majority shareholders’ failure to account for the profit made by their own wholly-owned company K Ltd, whose establishment and rapid growth had been the result of the respondents’ misuse of S Ltd’s assets.  The respondents had applied successfully in the lower court to strike out the petition on the basis that further prosecution would be an abuse of the process of the court, since the appellant already had the power to require the respondents to purchase its shares at a fair price by exercising a put option in the shareholders’ agreement, or by accepting an offer to purchase made by the respondents. The lower court had struck out the petition on the basis that there was no realistic chance of the court making the order sought in the light of the respondents’ offer to buy the shares and the rights given by the shareholders’ agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 On appeal, the appellant argued that the value of the shares should be determined by the court because the appellant’s interests had been unfairly prejudiced by actions of the respondents which had been in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to S Ltd; and resolution of the issues raised in the petition involved mixed questions of fact and law appropriate to be determined by the court rather than by auditors of the company.  In agreeing with the appellants, the English Court of Appeal held that since there had not yet been any findings of fact as to whether the respondents had misused any of the assets of S Ltd, it was proper – for the purposes of determining whether the petition should be struck out – to assume that the pleaded allegations would be established.  It would not be right to conclude, at such an early stage of proceedings, that the appellant’s submissions could not succeed. As to whether or not the respondents’ actions amounted to a breach of their fiduciary duties, this was likely to depend upon the facts probably upon the extent and type of misuse; and that being so, it would not be right to strike out the petition.  The price to be paid for the shares would depend on a decision as to whether any part of the business of K Ltd was held on trust for S Ltd, and if so, how much: as the appellant had pointed out, this raised mixed questions of fact and law which should be decided by the court and not an accountant.  It followed that the respondents’ offer to purchase and the option in the shareholders’ agreement were not sufficient to remove any potential unfair prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,32,96,1) ">114 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Turning to recent cases post </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">O’ Neill, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Loveridge v Loveridge </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2021] EWCA Civ 1697</span>

While the assets of a company could be valued, valuing them rather than the share capital would not ordinarily result in a value attributable to the shares because it would ignore debts and other liabilities (at [124]–[125]). The court also rejected the argument that there was a risk that an expert would interpret the offer as requiring a valuation of Michael’s shareholding in the open market, which could be nil or close to nil, on the basis that there was no market for a minority shareholding.  The court pointed out that the offer letter had made clear that no minority discount was to be applied and that both parties would be permitted to make submissions to the expert; and it had also incorporated an invitation to identify any elements not in compliance with the requirements of the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">O’Neill</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> guidelines (at [126]).  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,32,96,1) ">115 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Critically, having made the above findings, the court proceeded to make the following observations (at [127]):</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether an offer complies with</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> O'Neill v Phillips</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> guidelines is not by itself determinative</span>.

</div> the second to fourth defendants applied to strike out a petition in which the petitioner sought a winding-up order against the first respondent company (at [1]). The then-solicitors to the respondents set out an offer to buy the petitioner’s shares at a fair value (at [14]). The court held that even if an alternative remedy existed and the petitioner was acting unreasonably in seeking to have the company wound up regardless of the offer, the court still had a discretion whether or not to strike out the petition (at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 On the facts in <span class="font-italic">Robinson</span>, the court held (at [62]) that the offer made was fair and the petitioner’s refusal to engage in its open-ended terms (namely, the invitation to submit details and counter-proposals) was unreasonable. First, although no offer was made in respect of monies previously applied for the second respondent’s benefit, the court noted that given the costs and inconvenience to all parties of a liquidation, coupled with the encouragement which a court should give to offerors to amend their offers, and the court’s assessment of “the limited extent to which a liquidator would likely engage in much beyond a fairly rough and ready approach to making adjustments for the respondents’ alleged wrongdoings”, the lack of such an offer in itself was insufficient to justify the offer being dismissed out of hand (at [39]). Second, although there was no detailed mechanism for valuation of the land, assets belonging to the company would be valued by the appointed expert as an intrinsic part of his valuation of the company’s assets, so as to arrive at a fair value of the shares. Moreover, if any of the assets were not company assets but were to be transferred under the offer, the petitioner could have raised this as a point of detail (at [41]). Third, while no offer was made to pay the petitioner’s legal costs, this was adequately excused by the fact that the offer had been made before the petition was issued: the principle remains that the absence of an offer to pay costs cannot serve an independent ground for dismissing a petition that is otherwise well founded (at [43]). Fourth, the refusal to provide information about the company paying the respondents’ costs of the proceedings was irrelevant to the court’s determination of the fairness of the offer. This point arose only in respect of costs incurred <span class="font-italic">after</span> the petition was presented (at [44]). Fifth, although it was argued that the offer did not address the parties’ dispute over jointly-owned private land, the court was of the view that this did not affect the reasonableness of the offer, as the offer was expressed to represent a full and final settlement of claims between the parties as shareholders of the company. A winding-up order would similarly not provide a solution to issues between the parties in relation to land privately owned by them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">118 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Re Sprintroom Ltd Prescott v Potamianos and another; Potamianos v </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Prescott and another </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2019] EWCA Civ 932 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Re Sprintroom</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”),</span>

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Dr Potamianos – as the minority shareholder in the company Sprintroom Ltd (“SEL”) – brought a petition under ss 994-996 of the UK Companies Act 2006, claiming that he had been excluded from the management of the company and that the affairs of the company were being carried on by the majority shareholder (a Mr Prescott) in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to Dr Potamianos’ interests. Dr Potamianos argued that Mr Prescott’s offers to buy out his shares in the company were not fair or reasonable (at [111]). At the same time, the company SEL brought suit against Dr Potamianos and his service company in respect of intellectual property rights in certain software (“the source code claim”). At first instance, the court ordered that the source code claim be tried together with the issues whether the company was a quasi-partnership and whether Mr Prescott had conducted the company’s affairs in an unfairly prejudicial manner, with any question concerning the reasonableness of Mr Prescott’s offers for Dr Potamianos’ shares – insofar as that question required expert valuation evidence – to be determined at a further trial. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On appeal, the English Court of Appeal held that the question whether Mr Prescott had made a reasonable offer to buy Dr Potamianos’ shares was not logically antecedent to questions of unfairly prejudicial conduct, because the factors that indicated the reasonableness or otherwise of an offer would often be closely bound up with the behaviour that was alleged to be unfairly prejudicial.  The terms and conditions of an offer were part of the overall consideration by the court of whether a petition should succeed. The value offered, or the means proposed for arriving at that value, would be an important factor. The fairness of the value might be linked with the substance of the unfair prejudice allegations.  Further, the Court of Appeal held that the first-instance judge had erred in deciding that he could not assess the reasonableness of the offers and of Dr Potamianos’ response without expert valuation evidence. In the Court of Appeal’s view, there was sufficient material to establish that the making and rejection of the offers were not factors that defeated Dr Potamianos’ petition by making his exclusion from the company fair: an evaluation of all the circumstances surrounding the offers showed that none of them rendered Dr Potamianos’ exclusion from the company fair. As such, the offers could not be relied on to defeat Dr Potamianos’ petition; and expert valuation evidence would make no difference to that conclusion.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It is worth noting that in coming to the above conclusions, the Court of Appeal highlighted that in cases decided post </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">O’Neill</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">where parties have cited the guidance in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">O’Neill</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“judges have counselled against treating the reasonableness of an offer as being a trump card in the hands of the respondent majority shareholder” (at [129]).

The ground relied on was that the first respondent, Mr Karvaski, had made an offer or offers to purchase the shares in the second respondent company (“Sitewatch” or “the company”) beneficially owned by Mr Paul Morris, (the effective Complainant), the refusal of which was unreasonable; and that in consequence, the continued prosecution of the petition was either an abuse or was bound to fail, for the reasons set out in Lord Hoffmann’s  judgment in <span class="font-italic">O'Neill v Phillips</span>.  In dismissing the respondents’ application, HHJ Cooke held that while the guidance provided in O’Neill went into considerable detail, “(n)evertheless it does not have the status of legislation”.  Importantly, in his view -</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The correspondence and argument between <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the parties in this case (eg the reference to an offer “in O'Neill v Phillips format”) appeared in my view to approach the matter as if what had to be</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> considered was the extent to which the offer made complied with these guidelines, or the precedents set out in Mr Joffe's textbook, and that if a sufficient degree of compliance was achieved, Mr Karvaski would inevitably be protected from any petition that Mr Morris might issue. That in my view would be a cardinal error. The question for the court is always whether in all the circumstances of the case the Applicant has satisfied the conditions required to have the petition struck out</span>, or summary judgment in his favour given on it. These Mr Shaw accurately summarised as being that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it must be shown that the continued prosecution of the petition after the making of the offer amounts to an abuse of process, or was bound to fail. The issue is highly sensitive to the facts and circumstances of each case, and consideration of the nature and terms of any offer made can only ever be an intermediate step in the process</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 On the facts before him, HHJ Cooke held that where there were issues in the petition relating to allegations of breach of duty owed to the company by one or other party, if they would go to the price of the shares, an expert valuer would not be in a position to determine the factual and legal disputes between the parties.  As he pointed out:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To take an obvious example, if a petitioner alleges that his co-shareholder has diverted business or misapplied assets, it would not be just to require him to accept a price for his shares determined by an expert without an authoritative determination of the claim. The expert could only express an opinion whether the value given to the potential claim in the company's accounts (probably nil) was appropriate, or what effect the existence of the disputed claim might have on the price an arm's length purchaser would be prepared to pay for the shares. Neither of these would be likely to give the petitioner anything like the benefit he would receive if the dispute were resolved in his favour and the breach made good or fully allowed for in the price. The Respondent, who must (at the stage of a strike out application) be assumed to be in breach, would benefit from the breach twice over in that he would not only have the proceeds of the breach itself, but be able to acquire the company at a price depressed by the consequences of his own breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Hong Kong cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In the interest of completeness, I note that the principles enunciated in the above English authorities have also been accepted and applied by the Hong Kong courts. In <span class="font-italic">Re Prudential Enterprise Ltd</span> [2001], the petitioners, who were the company’s minority shareholders and siblings of the first respondent (the majority shareholder), presented a petition seeking a winding-up order on the just and equitable ground and alternatively relief under s 168A of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap 32), including an order that their shares be purchased at a price to be determined. The petitioners alleged that the first respondent had misappropriated company funds through Interstitial Holdings Ltd, an offshore company (the Interstitial scheme). They further claimed that the first respondent had increased his shareholding from 26.86% to 68.85% by allotting 8,126 shares to himself at gross undervalue (the rights issue exercise) and that he had used the company funds or funds attributable to the company and generated from the Interstitial scheme to pay the $257.8m subscription money for the rights issue exercise. The Interstitial scheme and the use of company funds to finance the rights issue exercise were also the subject matter of a derivative action commenced by the petitioners. The first respondent subsequently offered to purchase the petitioners’ shares in the company (the revised offer), on the basis that the 8,126 shares allotted pursuant to the rights issue exercise had not been allotted. The value of the shares would be assessed by an independent expert valuer: the revised offer spelt out the terms on which such valuation would be conducted (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, that the petitioners were only to have information relevant to any point on which the valuer required submissions from the parties and could only make submissions to the valuer when required and called upon by the valuer). When the petitioners declined to take up the revised offer, the first respondent applied to strike out or stay the amended petition on the ground that the continued pursuit of the petition in the face of the revised offer constituted an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In dismissing the first respondent’s application to strike out, Chu J held that the basic requirements for a reasonable offer were as set out in the judgement of Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span>. However, not all petitions for s 168A relief could be suitably dealt with by referring the matter to an expert for valuation of the share price and by having the petitioner’s shares bought out at the value determined by the valuer. In the present case, both the rights issue exercise and the Interstitial scheme involved complicated issues of facts and law which an expert lacked the proper machinery to adjudicate upon. Further, the court was not relieved of the task of a trial on the complaints raised by the petitioners under the revised offer nor would it dispense with the hearing on the appointment of the provisional liquidator. The derivative action would go on and judicial resources as well as costs would remain to be incurred. There was no question of an abuse of process as the petitioners would have their day in court whether they rejected or accepted the revised offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Further, and in any event, Chu J held that it could not be said that the revised offer was plainly a suitable and reasonable one.  For example, the revised offer did not provide for ‘equality of arms’ between the parties. The mechanism envisaged by the revised offer only afforded the petitioners a limited access to company information and opportunity to make representations on the value of the company. It followed that the petitioners would not be able to draw to the valuer’s attention matters or areas of concern nor would they be able to make meaningful representation to the valuer on matters or areas of concern. That was hardly fair nor sufficient given the petitioners’ complaint was that the first respondent had been practising a scheme of manipulating of the company funds and assets. In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the petitioners to refuse to accept the revised offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The first respondent’s appeal against Chu J’s decision was dismissed: <span class="font-italic">Re Prudential Enterprise Ltd</span> [2002] 2 HKC 375. The Court of Appeal held that the petitioners were entitled to a fair and reasonable price for their shares, but that the requirements that were necessary to ensure that the petitioners would be given a fair and reasonable price varied, depending on the facts in each case. In the present case, in view of the limited scope of the information provided for in the revised offer by the first respondent, the revised offer was clearly not enough to meet the concerns of the petitioners. For example, while the expert was permitted to take into account the amount of $257.8m paid by the first respondent as subscription money for the new shares, the expert was precluded by the terms of the offer from giving reasons for his valuation; and the petitioners thus had no way of knowing whether he had in fact done so. The issue was not whether the expert knew that he had taken this amount into consideration but whether the petitioners knew on the information available to them whether all their requirements had been met in the valuation of the shares. Further, the petitioners had asked that the valuation be conducted on the basis that the transfer of shares to the first respondent had been wrongfully allotted and on the basis that the company’s investment in Interstitial’s preference shares be valued as if Interstitial had never existed. The offer did not take these matters into account.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the appropriate framework to be applied in considering the striking-out application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Having examined the above caselaw, I wish to make it clear, first of all, that I reject the second to fourth Defendants’ proposed three-stage framework (see above at [92]). The second to fourth Defendants’ framing of their proposed Stage 3 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the Court is able to utilise its tools and procedures to resolve any impediment to the petitioner’s acceptance of the offer) amounts in effect to over-liberalising the court’s approach to striking out claims for minority oppression, which would be acutely at odds with the high threshold for O 18 r 19 applications and the judicial recognition that striking out is a draconian practice. As Lord Hoffmann made clear in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span>, and as our Singapore courts too have held in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Li</span><span class="font-italic">m Swee Khiang</span> and <span class="font-italic">Lim Chee Twang</span>, the crux of the matter is that where a reasonable buy-out offer is made to a minority shareholder, and that offer would give the minority shareholder all that he could reasonably expect to obtain from a minority oppression claim, then that offer should generally be accepted. To bring a minority oppression claim in those circumstances would amount to an abuse of process because the relief sought in the proceedings would have been obtained had the offer been accepted. In this context, it is not the role of the court to wade into the fray and to “utilise its tools and procedures to resolve any impediment to the petitioner’s acceptance of the offer”. For one, any buyout offer is essentially a contract between the parties – and it is trite law that parties are free to contract as they see fit. It is not the role of the court to grease the wheels of contractual negotiation in a buyout offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Further, I have serious reservations as to the <span class="font-italic">legal basis </span>on which the court should “utilise its tools and procedures to remove any impediments to the petitioner accepting the offer”. In this regard, the second to fourth Defendants have sought to rely on the words of Morritt LJ in <span class="font-italic">North Holdings </span>at 639g: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Like Aldous LJ I would emphasise the need, in all such cases, for active case management at an early stage so as to reduce the time and expense involved in ascertaining the fair price to be paid for the petitioner’s shares. <span class="font-weight-bold">Where the issue is the basis of the valuation then the identification of the problem and the trial of a preliminary issue directed to it should remove that obstacle to an agreement.</span> Where the issue is the identity of the valuer the problem often arises because the person suggested in the articles or by the majority shareholder is the auditor. If the issue arises from the accounting treatment accorded to certain items then prima facie the auditor would not be a suitable person to carry out the valuation. But more often the objection arises from the belief of the minority shareholder that the auditor will feel beholden to the majority shareholders. <span class="font-weight-bold">In such cases the obstacle may be removed by the court itself appointing an expert to value the shares; in suitable cases the expert may be the auditor, but acting on appointment by the court rather than by the parties. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In similar vein (so the second to fourth Defendants say), within the framework of the Rules of Court 2014, O 33 rr 2 and 3 may be used by the court to determine the preliminary issue of the valuation of shares, rather than having a full trial on liability followed by an assessment of damages thereafter.  What the second to fourth Defendants have overlooked, however, in citing <span class="font-italic">North Holdings</span> (at 639g), is what Morritt LJ said in the preceding paragraph (at 639e):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the past the choice appeared to lie between striking out the petition as an abuse of the process of the court and allowing it to proceed to a full hearing.

Morritt J’s remarks must be read in that context – that given the change to the civil procedure rules in the UK, the court was empowered to actively manage cases, and could, to that end, make orders in an unfair prejudice petition to remove obstacles to an agreement between parties for the valuation and buyout of the shares. In contrast, under the Rules of Court 2014, there is no similar provision empowering the court to actively manage cases in such a manner (for the purposes of the present judgement, I do not find it necessary to discuss whether the court’s powers under the Rules of Court 2021 extend to making orders in minority oppression proceedings “to remove any impediments to the petitioner accepting the [buyout] offer”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For completeness, I also examine the principles in relation to O 33 r 2; specifically, whether they afford the court the power to “remove any impediments” to the plaintiff in a minority oppression suit accepting a buyout offer by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, ordering a preliminary trial of the valuation of shares. This point was raised by counsel for the first defendant, who sought and obtained leave to make short submissions to assist the court, on the basis that the first defendant – though not a party to the striking-out application <span class="font-italic">per se </span>– was nevertheless an interested party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 It is trite that O 33 r 2 is a power-conferring provision, and in deciding whether this power should be exercised, the only question the court has to consider is whether substantial time and expenditure would be saved in respect of the trial of the action as a whole if it is exercised: <span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and ors </span>[2017] 1 SLR 918 at [22], citing <span class="font-italic">Federal Insurance Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 982 at [25]. It is therefore clear that the court’s power under O 33 r 2 is meant to be exercised with a view towards saving time and expense at the trial itself. It is not designed as a tool for the court to remove any impediments which stand in a way of a minority shareholder accepting a buyout offer, especially absent any provision in the Rules of Court 2014 which are comparable to Rules 1.1 and 1.4 of the CPR 1998. I would add that even if it were open to me to exercise my power under O 33 r 2 in the manner suggested by the first defendant, I would decline to do so, as it is unclear whether ordering a preliminary trial of the valuation of the shares will save substantial time and expenditure.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Ultimately, the reason why the rejection of a reasonable buyout offer constitutes an abuse of process is because such an offer – if it gives the plaintiff all he could reasonably expect to obtain upon succeeding at trial – renders the suit <span class="font-italic">completely unnecessary</span>. Otherwise, the presence of a reasonable buyout offer <span class="font-italic">per se </span>is not inherently anathema to the plaintiff’s continued prosecution of his action. A close examination and comparison of what the plaintiff would receive under the buyout offer versus the reliefs sought in the suit should be undertaken so as to determine whether the buyout offer renders the suit completely unnecessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Having considered the existing authorities, I am of the view that in determining whether a minority oppression claim should be struck out where a buyout offer has been made, it will be helpful to adopt the following framework:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Stage 1:</span> Is the offer presented a “reasonable offer”, taking into account Lord Hoffman’s guidelines in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips</span>? This is a logical starting point – the offer must have been a reasonable one such that the plaintiff could be expected to accept it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Stage 2:</span> If the offer is a reasonable one, was the plaintiff justified in rejecting that offer and choosing to seek relief by bringing a claim for minority oppression? Here, one key consideration is whether the offer encompasses all the reliefs sought in the plaintiff ’s claim. To determine this, close attention must be paid to the reliefs sought and what the plaintiff can reasonably expect to obtain at trial. If the buyout offer contains all the reliefs which the plaintiff can reasonably expect to obtain at trial, then the striking out of his action would be appropriate, on the basis that the continued prosecution of his action serves no useful purpose and is an abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin </span>at [34(c)]). A related consideration at this stage is whether there are any disputed issues which are more appropriately determined by the court.  In approaching Stage 2 in the present case, it is also appropriate – for the purposes of determining whether Mr Kroll’s action should be struck out – to assume that the allegations he has pleaded <span class="font-italic">will</span> be established. As the English CA pointed out in <span class="font-italic">North Holdings</span> (at 635e–f), at such an early stage of proceedings, there will not yet have been any findings of fact made by the court vis-à-vis the plaintiff’s allegations of oppressive conduct; and it “is proper to assume that the pleaded allegations will be established”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The offer is a reasonable offer under the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">O’Neill</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> guidelines</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Applying the above framework, I accept that the Buyout Offer appears to be a reasonable one <span class="font-italic">per </span>the <span class="font-italic">O’Neill </span>guidelines. First, the offer is for the purchase of shares at fair value – having expressly provided no minority discount (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eck Hong</span>) and provided for the 7.67% shareholding that Mr Kroll claims to be entitled to. Second, a set of criteria has been set for the joint appointment of a suitably qualified assessor. Third, provision has been made for the date of valuation and for parties to propose factors and matters which could affect the valuation (see <span class="font-italic">Robinson</span>). Fourth, provision has also been made for parties to have equal access to documents and information and to make submissions to the assessor. Lastly, the Buyout Offer has considered the question of the costs of the assessor and assessment process as well as the legal costs in the Suit (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eck Hong</span>; <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No finding of abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 While I accept that the Buyout Offer is reasonable in that it meets the <span class="font-italic">O’Neill </span>guidelines, I am of the view that striking out is not warranted in the present case. I explain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 First, I do not find that the Buyout Offer has dealt with all issues in dispute in Suit 915, such that it results in there being no useful purpose served by Mr Kroll continuing with his claim (see <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin</span> at [34(c)]). For one, a reason (among several) given by Mr Kroll for rejecting the Buyout Offer is that it excludes the USD 180 million valuation of CTX. The dispute between the parties as to whether CTX has been rightly valued at USD 180 million as of May 2021 is  one which has not been addressed in the buyout offer. In Mr Kroll’s pleadings, he takes issue with what he claims to be differing valuations of CTX at different times, whereas Mr Wong alleges in his Defence and Counterclaim that the valuation at USD 180 million arose from the valuation benchmark agreed on in the ARIA, which came into being only after and as a result of the 30 April 2021 EGM (see above at [41]–[42]). I do not think that the invitation in the Buyout Offer to propose post-value adjustments suffices to resolve this issue, because the Buyout Offer sets the date of valuation at 30 April 2021, thereby precluding any discussion of whether the USD180 million valuation may still be adopted during the valuation process. Nor am I persuaded by the second to fourth Defendants’ assertion that the assessor will be free to consider the USD180 million figure as the appropriate valuation benchmark, given that the Buyout Offer sets the valuation date at 30 April 2021, and the USD 180 million valuation is said by the second to fourth Defendants to arise from developments <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I note that the second to fourth Defendants have sought to explain the 30 April 2021 valuation date stated in the Buyout Order on the basis that this was the date of the EGM at which resolutions were passed, leading to the dilution of Mr Kroll’s shareholding.  However, this explanation seeks unfairly to telescope Mr Kroll’s complaints of oppressive conduct into one single event – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the 30 April 2021 EGM – when in fact, an examination of his pleadings reveal that his complaints range far beyond the EGM and the resolutions that led to his share dilution.  From Mr Kroll’s SOC, it is evident that the oppressive conduct he complains of started <span class="font-italic">before </span>30 April 2021.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Thus, for example, Mr Kroll has charged

</div> that the second defendant Mr Wong and the fourth defendant Ms Hong – both of whom he alleges were shadow directors of CTX at all material times – caused CTX to enter into “questionable contracts involving large sums of money” sometime in 2019 that benefited a company named Zeepson Technology of which Ms Hong was the founder, CEO and / or majority shareholder. In oral submissions, counsel for Mr Kroll described this as “self-dealing” by the second to fourth Defendants which contributed to running down the company’s funds. Mr Kroll also pleads that around the same period, Mr Wong and Ms Hong caused CTX to enter into “questionable contracts involving large sums of money” with another company named Saibotan, in which another CTX shareholder Mr Yang was a director. Large sums totalling more than SGD 3 million – accounting for approximately 35% of CTX’s paid-up capital – were paid out to Zeepson and Saibotan pursuant to these contracts.  Mr Kroll further pleads that around April 2021, he was informed by Mr Wong and Ms Hong of alleged “problems” between Xiamen Anne (then a shareholder of CTX) and Chinese security regulators which necessitated CTX having to “automatically buy back” all of Xiamen Anne shares for SGD 10 million.

</div> When Mr Kroll declined to take up either of the two options given to him, he was shortly thereafter given one day’s notice of an EGM on 30 April 2021. On the same day, CTX’s ACRA records were also amended so as to reflect <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>Mr Wong’s shareholding at 51.9% (with Mr Kroll at 7.67%).  The shareholdings of two erstwhile directors Mr Chong and Ms Chan were removed and reduced respectively, while Dr Bai and his company Asia Green Fund were concurrently introduced as new shareholders holding a combined 24.5% of CTX’s shares.  These “carefully-timed” amendments to CTX’s ACRA records “provided Mr Wong with majority voting rights at the upcoming 30 April EGM”.

</div> They also entitled Dr Bai and Asia Green Fund to attend and vote at the 30 April 2021 EGM (though in the end, neither voted at the EGM).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Reading Mr Kroll’s SOC as a whole, therefore, his complaints about the oppression of his minority interest encompass events and conduct stretching back beyond 30 April 2021. There is some merit in his submission that the valuation must take into account disputed issues pre-dating the 30 April 2021 EGM. The Buyout Offer does not address this aspect of Mr Kroll’s claim at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Insofar as the second to fourth Defendants have tried to suggest that any such gaps would be addressed by the appointed assessor making “post-value adjustments”, no coherent explanation has been proffered as to how the assessor may go about making such adjustments to account for the pre-30 April 2021 instances of allegedly oppressive conduct. In any event, I am of the view that these allegations of oppressive conduct raise issues of mixed fact and law that are far more suitably determined by the court, rather than by an appointed assessor. The allegations relating to Zeepson, Saibotan and Xiamen Anne are essentially allegations about Mr Wong and Ms Hong running down CTX’s funds prior to their claims about CTX’s alleged “insolvency” and “cashflow difficulties” and their attempts to “pressure” Mr Kroll to exit the company at a low price. To borrow the words of HHJ Cooke in <span class="font-italic">Harbo</span><span class="font-italic">rne Road Nominees</span>, it would not be just in this situation to require Mr Kroll to accept a price for his shares determined by an assessor without an authoritative determination of his claims: the assessor can only express an opinion whether the value given to the potential claims in the company's accounts is appropriate, or what effect the existence of the disputed claims may have on the price an arm's-length purchaser will be prepared to pay for the shares. Neither of these options is likely to give Mr Kroll anything like the benefit he will receive if the dispute were resolved in his favour and the breaches made good or fully allowed for in the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Finally, I also find that there is some merit in Mr Kroll’s argument that pending the completion of the discovery process in this suit, he possesses insufficient information to consider the Buyout Offer in a meaningful manner.  Mr Kroll had earlier sought documents relating to the SGD 10 million repurchase of shares from Xiamen Anne. At the hearing, his counsel informed me that the Defendants had so far declined to produce these documents on grounds that they were confidential, and that nonetheless, having regard to parties’ discovery obligations in the litigation process, Mr Kroll expected these documents to surface during the discovery process.

The defendants have pointed to certain examples of Mr Kroll’s conduct as being indicative of his intention to use the proceedings as leverage to threaten and/or seek to embarrass or scandalise the defendants (see above at [72]). However, the second to fourth Defendants’ claims based on these examples seem somewhat speculative – even fanciful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Thus, for example, there is no basis to suggest that the filing of a generally-endorsed Writ of Summons or Mr Kroll’s delay in filing his SOC is a “scare tactic”. As stated in Mr Kroll’s affidavit, the request for an extension of time to file the SOC arose because parties had been engaged in without-prejudice settlement correspondence/discussions.

As I noted earlier, Mr Kroll’s complaint in paragraphs 57 to 59 of the Statement of Claim is that Mr Wong and Ms Hong caused CTX to enter into “questionable contracts involving large sums of money” which – as his counsel put it in oral submissions – contributed towards running down the funds of the company. As pleaded by Mr Kroll, large sums totalling more than SGD 3 million – accounting for approximately 35% of CTX’s paid-up capital – were paid out to Zeepson and Saibotan pursuant to these contracts.   Moreover, the Zeepson contracts benefited a company of which Ms Hong – allegedly a shadow director of CTX – was the founder, CEO and / or majority shareholder.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Viewed in this light, it is not plain and obvious to me that what is pleaded is factually unsustainable.

</div> at [81]). Essentially, as the company is a separate legal person in its own right, a shareholder has no standing to bring proceedings where wrongs <span class="font-italic">to the company </span>are concerned. The other side of the proper plaintiff rule is the bar on recovering reflective loss (“the no reflective loss principle”), where a a person may not initiate an action to recover a loss which he has suffered by virtue of a diminution in the value of his shares in a company which merely reflects the company’s own loss and for which the company can be made whole if it were to pursue its rights against the party responsible for that loss (<span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> at [82]). Taken together, the proper plaintiff rule and the reflective loss principle establish a delineation between personal and corporate rights. In essence, a breach of a right vested in a shareholder should be vindicated at the suit of the shareholder, while a breach of a right vested in the company should be vindicated at the suit of the company (<span class="font-italic">Ideal Design </span>at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 It is against the backdrop of this delineation between corporate and personal rights that the statutory regime of s 216 CA should be considered. S 216 CA is a mechanism by which shareholders can bring proceedings for <span class="font-italic">personal</span> wrongs. The rationale for limiting the application of s 216 CA to personal wrongs was laid out in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>”)

Andy Ong knew that Foo (and by extension, Sakae) trusted him and deliberately took advantage of that trust, using the Company as a vehicle through which he cheated Sakae. The result of this was that there were systemic abuses which benefitted one group of shareholders (namely, GREIC and, subsequently, ERC Holdings as well, both of which were controlled by Andy Ong at the material time) at the expense of the other (namely, Sakae)… these transactions taken together, coupled with the systemic nature of Andy Ong’s abuse, occasioned serious commercial unfairness to Sakae.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Sakae’s desired remedy of exiting the joint venture agreement, which was only available under s 216 CA, offered the only way in which it could vindicate the real injury it had suffered (<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [124], [125], [128]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">164 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Applying the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Ho Yew Kong</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">framework,</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I am of the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">view that Mr Kroll has a legal basis for claiming that a real and distinct injury has arisen.

As I understand it, Mr Kroll’s complaint is not merely that his shareholding was diluted at the 30 April 2021 EGM.  Mr Kroll claims that prior to 30 April 2021, the Defendants – specifically, Mr Wong and Ms Hong – had been running CTX as they pleased in an “opaque” manner; that in running CTX as they pleased, they had substantially depleted CTX’s funds with costly “questionable” transactions (the multi-million dollar payments to Zeepson and Saibotan, and later, the SGD 10 million “buy-back” of Xiamen Anne’s shares); that having brought about these “questionable” transactions, they had then sought to “pressure” him to exit the company at a “low price” by telling him that the company was “insolvent” and that its intended saviour Dr Bai would only inject new funds if he (Mr Kroll) left; and that when he refused the options they gave him for exiting the company, they had taken steps to dilute his shares at the 30 April 2021 EGM.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">166 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In sum, therefore, I do not find that Mr Kroll has failed to plead a distinct injury to himself </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">qua </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">shareholder.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  I reject the Defendants’ submission that the Zeepson and Saibotan pleadings merely disclose a corporate wrong.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Further, the essential remedy sought by Mr Kroll, like that sought in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>, allows him to exit CTX with minimal loss and to vindicate meaningfully the injury of a breach of his legitimate expectations. This is not a case where, assuming counsel for Mr Kroll successfully makes out the arguments it alludes to in its written submissions (see above at [164]), Mr Kroll would not be entitled to the remedy of a buyout of his shares or a winding-up.

For example, the description which counsel applied to the Zeepson and Saibotan contracts during oral submissions –<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, transactions which ran down the company’s funds – is not specifically pleaded (though paragraph 58 does plead the material facts relating to the allegedly disproportionate amounts paid).  As another example, while paragraph 57 expressly refers to the contracts having “benefitted companies linked to Ms Hong and Mr Yang” and while counsel characterised these contracts as instances of “self-dealing” by the Defendants, it is not clear why the contracts with Saibotan – of which <span class="font-italic">Mr Yang</span> is a director – would amount to <span class="font-italic">“self-dealing”</span><span class="font-italic"> by the Defendants</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I do not think the flaws in the pleadings are so irretrievably grave as to warrant striking-out at this juncture; and since counsel for Mr Kroll have indicated in their letter of 8 July 2022 that they are prepared to apply for leave to amend their pleadings, I will leave them to do the necessary in light of the comments I have made in this judgement.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Prayer 3: The MAS Form 11 Forgery Pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ respective positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The second to fourth Defendants’ position is that there is no link between this allegation of forgery and Mr Kroll’s claim for oppression,

Prayer 2, which seeks in the alternative the striking-out of paragraphs 57 to 59 of the Statement of Claim, is dismissed. Prayer 3, which seeks in the alternative the striking-out of paragraphs 55 to 56 of the Statement of Claim, is allowed: paragraphs 55 to 56 are to be struck out accordingly.  Prayer 4 is allowed: the plaintiff Mr Kroll is to have 7 working days from today to file and serve the amended Statement of Claim. I should make it clear that the amendments I refer to are the deletion of paragraphs 55 and 56. Any other amendments which Mr Kroll seeks to make to the Statement of Claim should be the subject of an application for leave to amend.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HC/RA 169/2022</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I address next RA 169, which is the second to fourth defendants’ appeal against the SAR’s order that the plaintiff Mr Kroll provide the three of them with security for costs totalling $70,000 for the period up to the conclusion of discovery.

</div> In addition, it is contended that where there are two (or more) co-defendants, the general rule is that only one set of costs is normally payable in the event that both (or all of them) succeed in the action – even if they are separately represented. The court should therefore not be minded to award any uplift based on the number of individual defendants.

The crux of the second to fourth defendants’ arguments is that the work done for the defence of one defendant is very different from the work to be done for the defence of the other defendants, and that this justifies an order for security of $62,500 <span class="font-italic">per </span>each defendant. However, as I observed in the course of the second to fourth Defendants’ oral submissions, an examination of the pleadings did not actually reveal that the second to fourth defendants had each taken a “very different” substantive position in their respective defences.
