<p xmlns=""><font color="#3322AA" face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>JUDGMENT:</strong></font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman">The claim</font></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    The plaintiff Arul

Chandran is a practising lawyer. He has been so for more than 30 years. This case concerns

an office of honour he held in the Tanglin Club, Vice-President, for one year from 25 May

1998. That office also made him a member of the general committee of the Club. There were

11 committee members all told.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    On 31 March 1999, he

was removed from office at a meeting of the general committee. It was the result of a

simple majority constituted by the six defendants in this case : William J Gartshore,

Colin A Taylor, Andre C Bouvron, Chim Hou Yan, Chan Kong Thoe, Kenneth Chew Keng Seng.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The plaintiff felt

deeply aggrieved by that decision. So he commenced this action. His purpose was to have

his removal declared unlawful and ineffective, with the result that he continued to hold

that office as elected Vice-President for the full term. Additionally, he sought as extra

relief general damages for mental distress and damage to reputation. As it was an office

of honour without an honorarium he did not assert any financial loss. When the

plaintiff’s counsel suggested general damages in the sum of $30,000 against each

defendant, I remarked that he should have gone to the District Court. In response he

mutated it to $50,000 against each defendant. According to him, the amount of compensation

the plaintiff was entitled to was directly proportionate to the number of defendants, even

though there was only one act and one indivisible damage. He never explained the logic of

this submission. I shall not let it detain me and I shall continue with the story.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    In his statement of

claim, the plaintiff pleaded his case on the basis of breach of the contract of membership

between the parties. The contract was a hypothesized contract which the law constructs for

the salvation of someone who has been unfairly victimized by Club politics. At the trial,

however, he abandoned his claim for general damages for defamation against the sixth

defendant only.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    In respect of the

expulsion, the plaintiff claimed general damages against all six defendants on the basis

that "he had suffered embarrassment, humiliation and damage to his reputation and

standing and had been unable to and/or been unfairly and/or unjustly deprived of his

elected office and/or been unable to attend to his elected duties at the Club as

Vice-President and a member of the general committee and had suffered embarrassment,

humiliation and damages to his position as a member of the Club".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    At the commencement

of the trial on 23 November 1999, the plaintiff indicated that he might amend his

statement of claim to plead conspiracy and add parties for that purpose, but eventually he

did not do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    The purported removal

was pursuant to the following rule in the constitution of the Club :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Any President, Vice-President, Honorary

  Treasurer or Member of the Committee who in the opinion of a majority of the Committee

  behaves in a manner prejudicial to the interest of the Club or conducts himself in a

  manner unbecoming a Member of the Committee or the Club shall cease to hold office and

  shall be removed from the Committee.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This rule hides a power which can lead to

division and destabilization in the Club. It enables six members of the general committee

to overthrow the President or the Vice-President, who might have been elected to that

office by six hundred members of the Club. There is much room for abuse because power

tends to be abused particularly when personal prejudices are involved. As long as that

power of removal remains in the hands of the general committee members, there is every

likelihood of litigation of the kind that is before me. It is not conducive to the good

name of the Club. That is something for the Club to ponder.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    The defendants sought

to defend the action. The cornerstone of their defence was that the plaintiff had acted

improperly in connection with a certain financial transaction relating to his position as

a member of the previous general committee. It went like this. The Club had taken out a

protection and indemnity insurance for the benefit of the members of the general

committee. In early 1998, all 11 members of the previous general committee were taken to

court by three ordinary members in respect of a separate matter. The present plaintiff was

a defendant in that action, in which he decided to be his own lawyer. The other 10

defendants in that action were represented by two sets of lawyers. The Court, Lee Seiu Kin

JC, decided against the committee members : See <i><b>Graeme McGuire v John Rasmussen</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46688&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 180</a>. They were ordered to pay the costs of the action. Following this, they

lodged a claim against the insurance company seeking an indemnity for their costs. The

insurers agreed. As the insurance was also for his benefit as a committee member the

present plaintiff asked the insurers whether they would pay him for the legal work he had

done. He revealed to the insurers that if they would not agree, he would not charge the

Club. The insurers agreed to pay his legal charges and eventually paid him. The amount the

plaintiff received was $17,000. The defendants in the present action felt that there was

something wrong in the plaintiff receiving that amount. It was on that score that they

acted in concert and voted him out of office. They said that in their opinion there was

sufficient justification to expel him from his elected office of Vice-President. I should

mention here that in relation to the legal expenses and any damages the present defendants

might have to pay in this suit, they have in fact sought refuge under the same insurance

facility as the plaintiff did.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    The case came up for

trial before me. The plaintiff was cross-examined. As the facts unfolded before me it

became evident that the act of the defendants amounted to an unwarranted interference with

the arrangement between the plaintiff and the insurers. The Club lost nothing by his act.

He had made the claim because he believed that the insurance policy taken out by the Club

was for his benefit and that it enabled him to make a claim against the insurers. The

insurers were also of the same view. The defendants therefore concerned themselves with

something which did not in any way alter or diminish the interest of the Club or the

committee. Indeed, someone had made a complaint to the Law Society about the

plaintiff’s conduct. The Society saw no warrant to impeach him for any impropriety.

The defendants’ course of action, therefore, was ill-founded on the facts by all

accounts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    In the event, even

before the conclusion of the cross-examination of the plaintiff in the trial before me,

the defendants threw in the towel and consented to judgment against themselves. The

consent judgment declared as follows : "The plaintiff’s removal as

Vice-President and as a member of the general committee of the Tanglin Club was wrongful

and consequently, the plaintiff remained the Vice-President and a general committee member

of the Tanglin Club until 25 May 1999". In addition it included a term that damages

were to be paid by the defendants. Such damages, if not agreed, were to be assessed by the

trial Judge. Damages were not agreed. More than that, the defendants radically changed

their position and said subsequently that as a matter of law substantial damages were not

payable. The matter came up before me. The assessment proceedings, in the event, became a

trial of an issue of a point of law on damages. It should be mentioned at this juncture

that in their defence the defendants did not raise any special defence on damages.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Denial of liability for damages</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    The arguments for

the defendants were advanced by the lawyers of the Club’s insurers. On the issue of

damages their submission went as follows : The plaintiff’s office at the Club as its

Vice-President and a general committee member was not an office of profit. Accordingly he

had not suffered any pecuniary loss as a result of his wrongful removal. In any case, the

plaintiff had not pleaded any pecuniary loss. The plaintiff was claiming damages for

breach of contract for embarrassment, humiliation and damage to his reputation and

standing. Save in very exceptional cases (of which this was not one), such damages were

not recoverable for breach of contract. The plaintiff’s claim for damages for loss of

reputation and standing could have been brought in defamation. In that situation the

defendants would have had their defences available. He had not pursued that course of

action. He had endorsed such a claim against the sixth defendant on the writ of summons

but decided to abandon it. The plaintiff had also indicated at the start of the trial that

he might amend his statement of claim to allege conspiracy and add parties. That, too, he

had decided not to proceed with. In the premises, the plaintiff was, at most, entitled to

nominal damages, which the defendants submitted should be limited to a sum of $1.00 each,

making a total of $6.00.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A trilogy of Singapore decisions</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    I shall preface the

analysis of the law on the issue before me by bethinking a trilogy of Singapore decisions

on the matter. In <i><b>Haron Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic Association</b></i> [

<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5652&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">1992] 1 SLR 18</a> I rejected a claim for general damages for mental distress in a club case.

I did so on the basis of <i><b>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd </b></i>[1909] AC 488. In <i><b>Haron

Mundir</b></i>,<i><b> </b></i>I attempted to explain one facet of the underlying reason

for the rule. Unbeknown to me, the law had turned a full circle. I shall explain this

later. Next, <i><b>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6086&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 884</a> I

refused a claim for general damages for injury to reputation in a breach of contract case.

Finally, in the case of <i><b>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49352&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 630</a>

ruled that the law will not award general damages for mental distress when damages are to

be assessed on a breach of contract basis. In that case, I made a further attempt to

explain another facet of the underlying reason for the rule. The last of the trilogy was

affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <i><b>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</b></i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Analysis of the law - Mental Distress</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    I now commence an

analysis of the law on the issue. Historically speaking, English law acted on the

apriorism that pure mental suffering without physical injury was an inevitable fact of

interpersonal relationships in private and public life alike. Unlike actionable physical

injury, which arises from an external cause, mental distress stems from inherent

predisposition of the individual. As it arose from the constitution and circumstances of

the individual it did not traditionally give a cause of action. After all, people must

learn to accept with a certain degree of stoicism the slings and arrows of this vale of

tears. In such instances, they should be slow to rush to the law with a tale of tears and

fears save in certain recognised circumstances. It makes no difference whether the event

causing such suffering was the commission of a tort or the breaking of a contract. In the

time-honoured language of the law, such suffering is too remote for recompense at law: see

<i><b>Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas</b></i> (1888) 13 AC 222. At one time, it

was thought that this was not a desirable situation because it failed to deter the callous

conduct of irresponsible people. So an attempt was made to move the boundary by Wright J

in <i><b>Wilkinson v Downton</b></i> (1897) 2 QB 57. Notably, that was not a contract

action. Even in tort the novelty failed to flourish. It is settled law that mental

distress by itself does not constitute sufficient damage to found a cause of action. In

1957, Devlin J stated the correct position in <i><b>Behrens v Bertram Mills Circus Ltd</b></i>

[1957] 2 QB 1 at 28 : "The general principle embedded in the common law that mental

suffering caused by grief, fear, anguish and the like is not assessable." It is apt

for me to repeat here what I said in <i><b>Haron Mundir v Singapore Amateur Athletic

Association</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5652&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 18</a> at p 31 :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The object of awarding damages in contract

  is different from tort. The underlying logic for the difference is that the law of

  contract is concerned with a defendant’s failure to improve the claimant’s

  position by his failure to keep a promise. In contract the loss is monetary and, being

  measurable in terms of money, is therefore special. The law of tort, on the other hand, is

  concerned with the plaintiff’s position made worse by a wrongdoing of the defendant.

  The damage is in the main non-economic and, being immeasurable, is general. Damages must

  be assessed. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Furthermore, in <b><i>Lonrho

v Fayed</i> (No 5)</b> [1993] 1 WLR 1489, the English Court of Appeal emphatically stated

that damages for injury to reputation and injury to feelings, though recoverable in an

action for defamation, could not be recovered in an action for conspiracy. To sustain a

claim for conspiracy, actual financial loss must be proved. The bottom line position is

that in tort damages for mental suffering became a subsidiary element in the assessment of

damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u><i> </i></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Present authorities</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    The position in

contract is very circumscribed. The present state of the law is stated clearly and

concisely in <i><b>Chitty On Contracts</b></i> 28<sup>th</sup> Edition, Para 27-069 as

follows :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">27-069 - Normally, no damages in contract

  will be awarded for injury to the claimant’s feelings, or for his mental distress,

  anguish, annoyance, loss of reputation or social discredit by the breach of contract; as

  where an employee is wrongfully dismissed in a humiliating manner. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    <i><b>Halsbury’s

Laws of England</b></i>, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, Vol 12(1) encapsulates the current law in

these words : </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">957<b> - </b>Whether damages are

  recoverable in contract for loss of enjoyment, loss of amenity, disappointment, vexation,

  distress or similar suffering caused by breach depends on the nature of the contract

  broken and on whether the innocent party suffers any accompanying physical discomfort or

  inconvenience. Such damages are awarded only exceptionally and awards are traditionally

  modest.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">958 - The general rule is that a contract

  breaker is not liable for distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension

  or aggravation caused to the innocent party by the breach of contract. The rule is one of

  policy and applies notwithstanding the foreseeability of the distress or other adverse

  event.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    The American wisdom

on the matter is accurately articulated in <i><b>Modern Law of Contracts</b></i>, 1999

Revised Edition, by Howard O. Hunter at p 18-12 :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Recovery for mental distress,

  disappointment, and anguish is inappropriate in contract actions for four reasons : (1) it

  is not directly related to the economic effect of the breach; (2) it is open to

  speculation; (3) it may be the subject of frivolous claims; and (4) it is not reasonably

  within the contemplation of the breaching party.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Damage to reputation</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    Closely related to

the problem of awarding damages for mental distress is the problem of damage to

reputation. As far back as English legal history can go, English law has recognised damage

to one’s reputation as a cause of action. This was because reputation carries greater

value than material wealth. This justification was well expressed in these words in <i><b>Otello

Act III Scene 3</b></i>.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It is on that moral fundament that the

torts of libel and slander were founded. Since, save in certain exceptional circumstances,

no general damages would be awarded in breach of contract cases, financial loss resulting

from damage to reputation must be proved in contract cases.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    Para 27-071 <i><b>Chitty

On Contracts</b></i> states the true principle that "Damages for loss of reputation

as such are not normally awarded for breach of contract, since protection of reputation is

the role of the tort of defamation". See also <i><b>Malik v Bank of Credit And

Commerce International SA</b></i> [1998] AC 20 where at page 40 Lord Nicholls said :

"I agree that the cause of action known to the law in respect of injury to reputation

is the tort of defamation."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Malik case</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    (i) However, that

recent decision of <i><b>Malik v Bank of Credit And Commerce International SA</b></i> made

a slight variation to the above rule. This case made it possible to recover financial

loss, that is special damages, where breach of a contract damages one’s reputation

which in turn causes foreseeable <i>financial loss</i> to the claimant. The claim is

subject to the established limiting principles of remoteness causation and mitigation. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The <i><b>Malik</b></i> case arose

out of a contract of employment and the disastrous collapse of the infamous bank –

Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA ("BCCI") ("the bank").

Malik was the head of deposit accounts and customer services at a branch office of the

bank. When the bank was ordered to be wound up he was dismissed by the provisional

liquidators on the ground of redundancy. He brought an action asserting that he had lost

more than his job. He said that by reason of the corrupt and/or dishonest manner in which

the bank operated and the consequential collapse of the bank he was at a handicap on the

labour market because he was stigmatised by reason of his employment by the bank. He

claimed £50,000 based on some "table of service". His claim was based on an

implied term in his contract of employment that "the employer will not, without

reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or

seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and

employee." The liquidators rejected the claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) On appeal Evans-Lombe J refused to

imply the term contended for. The Judge found <i><b>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd</b></i> the

principal stumbling block. On appeal the Court of Appeal was prepared to imply a term to

the effect that the bank was under a duty not, without reasonable and proper cause, to

conduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the

relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. Nevertheless,

"stigma damage" as a head of compensation was not recoverable in law. Once again

<i><b>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd</b></i> provided the justification for the decision. Malik

appealed to the House of Lords. His appeal was allowed. The House of Lords ruled that the

bank had broken its implied obligation of trust and confidence. Accordingly Malik was

entitled to damages for the financial loss suffered by him upon proof and to the extent

that his future employment prospects were prejudiced by the stigma of his employment with

the eggregious employer. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) The <i><b>Malik</b></i> case does

not, however, affect the law relating to general damages for breach of contract. It must

at once be appreciated that this was not a case of wrongful termination of employment. The

breach there related to an independent implied term. Next, it was not a claim for general

damages but special damages – that is to say financial loss. Despite <i><b>Malik</b></i>’s

case, the general rule remains that for breach of contract, the compensation is for proven

financial loss and not general damages</font></p>

<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Ruxley Electronics case</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    It is now necessary

to consider another House of Lords decision, namely, <i><b>Ruxley Electronics and

Construction v Forsyth</b></i> [1996] AC 344. This case gives effect to the ancient Greek

wisdom : "Nothing too much". That saying was transformed into a rule of law by

the great American judge – Cardozo J. In the leading case of <i><b>Jacob &amp; Youngs

Inc v Kent</b></i> (1921) 129 N.E. 889 Cardozo J, delivering the judgment of the majority

of the Court of Appeals of New York, held that the court will not award damages which

would be grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be obtained. In the <i><b>Ruxley

Electronics</b></i> case, the defendant had contracted to build a swimming pool with a

diving area 7 feet 6 inches deep. On completion the diving area was only 6 feet deep. The

owner claimed £21,500 being the estimated cost of rebuilding it to the contractual dept

of 7 feet 6 inches. The plaintiff had no intention of reconstructing the pool to the

contractual depth. Judge Diamond QC rejected the claim of special damages and awarded

general damages in the sum of £2,500 for loss of pleasurable amenity. The Court of Appeal

reversed the decision. The House of Lords restored the decision of Judge Diamond QC. The

House of Lords held that the plaintiff was entitled to something for loss of amenity. The

claim for the estimated cost of reinstatement in the circumstances of the case was

unreasonable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The plaintiff’s arguments </font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    The present

plaintiff pitched his case at a high level. It was postulated to depend on the proposition

that general damages would be awarded for mental distress and its cognates arising from

breach of contract if that was within the contemplation of the parties. The plaintiff

relied on<i><b> Cox v Philips Industries Ltd</b></i> [1976] 1 WLR 638 which first

articulated the proposition in 1975.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    Another case relied

on by the plaintiff was <i><b>Tippett v International Typographical Union</b></i> (1976)

71 DLR (3D) 146. In that case, it was held that general damages within reasonable bounds

were recoverable for loss of reputation and mental distress arising from breach of

contract. The case applied the test of foreseeability. The court sidestepped <i><b>Addis v

Gramophone Co Ltd</b></i> on the understanding that in that case the mental distress was

not foreseeable. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    The plaintiffs

further cited <b><i>Brown v Waterloo Regional Board of Commissioners of Police</i> </b>(1982)

136 DLR (3d) 49. The case stated, inter alia, the following at p 56 :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is now clear that damages are

  recoverable for mental suffering flowing from a breach of contract if such damage is

  within the contemplation of the parties at the time they enter the contract. Normally, in

  ordinary commercial contract situations, it is not contemplated that mental suffering will

  result from a breach of contract; however, where the contract affects "personal,

  social and family interests", the likelihood of mental suffering in the event of a

  breach may be foreseen. There has been a dramatic breakthrough in the law in this area in

  recent years. The earlier law as set out in <i>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd</i> is being

  abandoned.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    In the above case,

the Court relied on <i><b>McGregor on Damages</b></i> 13<sup>th</sup> Ed (1972) and the

following proposition of Lord Denning MR in <i><b>Cook v S</b></i> [1967] 1 All ER 299 at

p 303 "I think that, just as in the law of tort, so also in the law of contract,

damages can be recovered for nervous shock or anxiety state if it is a reasonably

foreseeable consequence".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    Great reliance was

placed by the plaintiff on a New Zealand case : <i><b>Whelan v Waitaii Meats Ltd</b></i>

[1991] 2 NZLR 74. In that case the New Zealand High Court awarded $50,000 as general

damages in a wrongful dismissal case. The principal reason the court gave for not

following <i><b>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd</b></i> was that the proposition that the law

did not permit general damages for breach of contract was no longer the law as the House

of Lords itself had departed from it in <i><b>Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd</b></i>

[1920] AC 102.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    After reviewing the

relevant authorities, I concluded that the plaintiff relied on outdated law based on

outdated cases and books. <i><b>Cox v Philips Industries Ltd</b></i> was overruled by <i><b>Bliss

v South East Thames Regional Health Authority</b></i> [1987] 1 C.R. 700. The 16<sup>th</sup>

edition of <i><b>McGregor On Damages</b></i> has abandoned the purported changes in law

stated in earlier editions. By 1991, attempts to put an end to the conventional wisdom had

died a silent death. The law had turned a full circle. In 1991, in the case of <i><b>Watts

v Morrow</b></i> [1991] 1 WLR 1421, Bingham L.J. lucidly put the point and purpose of the

correct rule at 1445 :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A contract-breaker is not in general

  liable for any distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension or

  aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party. This rule is

  not, I think, founded on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable, which

  they surely are or may be, but on considerations of policy. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">But the rule is not absolute. Where the

  very object of a contract is to provide pleasure, relaxation, peace of mind or freedom

  from molestation, damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or

  if the contrary result is procured instead. If the law did not cater for this exceptional

  category of case it would be defective. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In <i><b>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49352&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 630</a>, counsel for the claimant declared with great fanatical force that it was

a monstrous principle and vowed to have it reversed on appeal. The case went on appeal.

The Singapore Court of Appeal, on the basis of <i><b>Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd,</b></i> as

further amplified in <i><b>Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd</b></i> [1973] 1 All ER 71 and <b><i>Malik</i>
</b>cases, held that general damages are not recoverable for mental distress arising from

breach of contract. See <i><b>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</b></i> (Civil Appeal No 303 of

1998) <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49598&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 560</a>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u><i> </i></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    On the basis of the

above discourse I have no alternative but to dismiss the claim for substantial general

damages. I award nominal damages of $1 against each defendant. In doing so I should make

it clear that the disallowance of the plaintiff’s extra relief for damages does not

in any way discount the exculpation he has been given with the agreement of his opponents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    Had the plaintiff

been suspended from or deprived of his Club membership I would have given general damages

under the exception of loss of amenities. In this case the plaintiff remained a member at

all times.</font></p>
