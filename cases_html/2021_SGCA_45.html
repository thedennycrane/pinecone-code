The arbitral process, generally speaking, commences with a Notice of Arbitration setting out the nature and scope of the dispute. This would typically be followed by the Statement of Claim shortly after the constitution of the tribunal. While the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim lay out the dispute from the claimant’s perspective, it would be incorrect to treat them as <span class="font-italic">exhaustively </span>defining the jurisdiction of the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Whether the scope of the dispute and hence the jurisdiction of the tribunal extends beyond the matters referred to in the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim must depend on the subsequent pleadings. Indeed, this was precisely brought to the fore by the arbitration between the parties to this appeal (the “Arbitration”). While the respondent, which was the claimant in the Arbitration, had not raised arguments in relation to the “second launch” of a vessel, the appellants, in anticipation that the point might subsequently be raised, referred to the “second launch” and expressly denied it in their Defence and Counterclaim. Thereafter, the issue in relation to the “second launch” was featured in the subsequent pleadings, the agreed list of issues (“ALOI”), the evidence in the Arbitration, and the parties’ respective submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Proceeding on the flawed premise that the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was somehow defined <span class="font-italic">only</span> by the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim, the appellants applied to set aside the arbitral award on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the basis that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it ruled on the “second launch” in favour of the respondent. The appellants might have had a case had they not introduced the “second launch” in their pleadings such that the “second launch” featured prominently in the proceedings thereafter. In that way, ironically, it was the appellants’ <span class="font-italic">own</span> pleadings which vested jurisdiction on the Tribunal to rule on the “second launch”. The mere fact that the respondent’s <span class="font-italic">principal</span> case in the Arbitration was not based on the “second launch” is a <span class="font-italic">non-sequitur. </span>As long as the issue of the “second launch” was properly before the Tribunal, that would suffice to confer jurisdiction on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We heard and dismissed the appeal on 8 April 2021 with brief grounds. In our detailed grounds below, we also take the opportunity to address the point as to whether we should adopt the position of the Hong Kong courts in awarding costs on an indemnity basis as the <span class="font-italic">default</span> position where an application to set aside an arbitral award has been unsuccessful. For the reasons set out below, we decline to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The facts have already been eloquently set out in the decision of the Judge below (the “Judge”), and we do not propose to repeat them in any great detail. Briefly, the appellants and the respondent entered into the following agreements on 9 June 2013:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A contract (“the Contract”) between the first appellant and the respondent where the respondent agreed to design, build, launch, equip, commission, test, complete, sell, and deliver to the first appellant a Self-Erected Tender Rig and a Derrick Equipment Set (collectively, the “Hull”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A company guarantee by the second appellant in favour of the respondent in respect of the Contract (the “Guarantee”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 After having entered into the Contract, the parties entered into a number of addenda to the contract. Addendum No. 2 was entered into on 24 September 2014. Of central importance to the present appeal is Article 6(d) of Addendum No. 2, which varied the payment term in the Contract such that 10% of the total contract sum (the “Fourth Instalment”) would become payable upon “launching and receipt of [the] invoice issued by the [builder, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the respondent]”. A further stipulation in Addendum No. 2 provided that “launching [was] subject to prior approval by the [ship classification society], [the first appellant], and [the respondent] collectively”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 20 January 2015, the respondent purported to launch the Hull into the water for the purposes of Art 6(d) of Addendum No. 2. That same day, the first appellant’s project manager emailed the respondent stating, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that it “[did] not consider the floating as launching”. Following the disputed launch on 20 January, various meetings involving the parties’ representatives were held on 21 January, 7 April, and 28 April 2015 (collectively, the “Construction and Progress Meetings”). The purpose of the Construction and Progress Meetings was, among other things, to iron out and update various outstanding items or deficiencies in the construction of the Hull that the first appellant required the respondent to remedy. It was the respondent’s position that by 28 April 2015, all outstanding issues and/or deficiencies in relation to the Hull had been resolved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 3 May 2015, the Hull was launched (the “second launch”). On 5 May 2015, the respondent demanded payment of the Fourth Instalment. As payment continued to be withheld, the respondent issued a default notice on 3 August 2016 pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee requesting that the appellants pay the Fourth Instalment. As payment was still not forthcoming, the respondent commenced the Arbitration against the appellants. The Notice of Arbitration was filed on 26 September 2016. Following the usual exchange of pleadings, an oral hearing took place between 21 and 25 May 2018, where both sides called factual and expert witnesses. Thereafter, detailed written closing and reply submissions were exchanged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The central issue in question at the Arbitration was, for present purposes, whether the respondent (the claimant in the Arbitration) was entitled to the Fourth Instalment. The Tribunal found that the respondent, first appellant, and the relevant ship classification society had collectively given their approval for the launch of the Hull, with the first appellant having given its approval on 28 April 2015 for the second launch on 3 May 2015.  The Tribunal found that the minutes of the Construction and Progress Meetings that took place on 7 and 28 April 2015 recorded that the respondent had resolved all the remaining items which the first appellant required the respondent to remedy before the Hull was considered to be in “[l]aunching condition”. The Tribunal also found that the minutes recorded the first appellant’s clear acceptance that the outstanding requirements had been met. By its acceptance that the outstanding issues had been resolved, the Tribunal found that the first appellant had also given its approval for the second launch. Even if the minutes did not show that the first appellant had given its <span class="font-italic">express </span>approval for the second launch of the Hull, the Tribunal was prepared to conclude that the first appellant ought to be treated as having approved it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Tribunal thus found that there was no valid reason for the appellants to withhold payment of the Fourth Instalment. Accordingly, in its award (the “Award”), the Tribunal ordered the appellants to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, pay the respondent the sum of US$13.9m (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Fourth Instalment) with interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The appellants then applied to set aside the part of the Award relating to the respondent’s claim for the Fourth Instalment under the Contract. The grounds the appellants relied on were twofold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 First, relying on Article 34(2)<span class="font-italic">(a)</span>(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the “IAA”), the appellants argued that the Award had been made in excess of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellants submitted that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the first appellant had, on 28 April 2015, approved the second launch of the Hull, thereby fulfilling the condition precedent that the respondent needed to satisfy prior to the second launch on 3 May 2015.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was also contended by the appellants that the Tribunal had <span class="font-italic">transposed</span> approval which had been given for the second launch in May 2015 <span class="font-italic">retrospectively</span> as consent for the earlier launch on 20 January 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Second, the appellants alleged that the Award had been made in breach of the right to present their case, in violation of Article 34(2)<span class="font-italic">(a)</span>(ii) of the Model Law and/or in breach of the rules of natural justice, in violation of s 24<span class="font-italic">(b)</span> of the IAA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellants complained that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice by deviating from the parties’ pleaded cases when it determined that the Hull had been properly launched in the second launch, and that the respondent had thus satisfied the conditions for payment of the Fourth Instalment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellants also asserted that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice by “disallowing the cross-examination of the [respondent’s] expert witness regarding the Contract … contrary to his Witness Statement and Responsive Report”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Judge dismissed all of the appellants’ attempts to impugn the Award in their entirety, finding that they were not borne out by the record from the Arbitration. Dissatisfied, the appellants appealed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On appeal, the appellants abandoned most of their arguments below. Instead, the appellants’ remaining submissions were twofold:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in  finding that there had been the requisite approval in April 2015 for the second launch of the Hull in May 2015. Accordingly, the Tribunal had also exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the Fourth Instalment had fallen due.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice and the appellants’ rights to be heard because the ground that the Tribunal had relied on, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that approval had been given for the <span class="font-italic">second</span> launch, was not in issue in the Arbitration. Accordingly, the appellants had been denied the opportunity to present their case on that issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the outset, it is essential to bear in mind that while the appellants relied on (a) an excess of jurisdiction and/or (b) a breach of natural justice to justify setting aside the impugned segments of the Award, the factual matrix for <span class="font-italic">both</span> grounds was in fact identical. Put another way, the breach of natural justice alleged by the appellants <span class="font-italic">required</span> the Tribunal to have exceeded its jurisdiction, because the appellants accept that if they had the opportunity to engage the issues which had in fact been placed before the Tribunal, it would follow that the Tribunal could not have acted in breach of natural justice. Thus, as was conceded by the appellants’ counsel before us, the appellants failing to establish that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction would necessarily be fatal to their breach of natural justice argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 We turned therefore to consider the question of whether the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in finding that the second launch had been approved by the parties and provided a basis for the Fourth Instalment to fall due. The law in this regard is fairly well-established. In <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank </span>SA [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [40] and [44], this Court set out a two-step inquiry on an application to set aside an award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law for excess of jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Court must identify what matters were within the scope of submission to the arbitral tribunal; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the arbitral award involved such matters, or whether it involved a “new difference … outside the scope of the submission to arbitration and accordingly … irrelevant to the issues requiring determination”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the Tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The question of what matters were within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration was answerable by reference to five sources: the parties’ pleadings, ALOI, opening statements, evidence adduced, and closing submissions at the Arbitration. Having reference to those sources, it was clear beyond peradventure that the issue as to whether the parties had approved the second launch such that the Fourth Instalment became payable was squarely before the Tribunal. There was thus no basis to contend that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in making that finding. We considered the five sources in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In determining the scope of a party’s submission to arbitration, the pleadings filed in the arbitration provide a convenient way to define the jurisdiction of the tribunal: <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals</span> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Prima</span>”) at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The appellants argued that the Statement of Claim and Notice of Arbitration did not make any reference to the second launch as providing a basis for the Fourth Instalment becoming payable. Accordingly, it was contended that the Tribunal’s reliance on the events of May 2015 concerning the second launch constituted reliance on unpleaded material. This was simply mistaken. The jurisdiction of a tribunal in deciding the dispute was <span class="font-italic">not </span>framed only by the Statement of Claim and Notice of Arbitration. There is ample authority for this fundamental proposition:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">PT Prima</span> at [34], this Court observed that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…in order to determine whether an arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to adjudicate on and make an award in respect of a particular dispute, it is necessary to refer to the pleaded case of each party to the arbitration and the issues of law or fact that are raised in the pleadings to see whether they encompass that dispute.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">There was no suggestion that the “pleadings” referred only to the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim. Moreover, the reference to the pleaded case “of each party” makes clear that the Defence and other such pleadings must also be included in determining the issues raised in the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 768 at [150] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It goes without saying that a particular chain of reasoning will be open to a tribunal if it arises from the party’s express pleadings. Significantly, an issue raised in a party’s pleadings remains in play throughout the arbitration unless [it] is expressly withdrawn, no matter how weakly the party may actually advance it …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Again, there was absolutely nothing to suggest that the reference to “pleadings” ought to be construed narrowly to <span class="font-italic">only</span> the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim. No authority was cited by the appellants to that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On the facts, it was not in contention that the initial claim (based on the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim) in the Arbitration was “premised on [the first] launch of 20 January [2015]”, and did not make reference to the second launch in May 2015. However, ironically and presumably in anticipation of the respondent’s full case, the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim expressly addressed the issue of whether the first appellant had granted its approval on 28 April 2015 for the second launch. Of particular note is the <span class="font-italic">repeated</span> reference to the second launch on 3 May 2015, and the appellants’ attempts to deny that approval for launch had been granted <span class="font-italic">at all</span>, rather than merely in relation to the January launch:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Prior to the alleged 1st Launch, and on 20 January 2015 itself, being the date of the alleged launch, [CDM] had made it known to [CDP] that [CDM] did not agree and/or consider [the Hull] to be ready for launch. It is and was therefore [CDM]’s position that [CDP] did not launch [the Hull] in accordance with the terms of [the Contract] on 20 January 2015, <span class="font-weight-bold">or at all to qualify for the fourth instalment</span>, being 10% of the contract price. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 [CDP] had agreed to make the necessary modifications and/or rectifications to [the Hull], and had subsequently arranged for a launch to take place on 3 May 2015 (the “2nd Launch”). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 Despite [CDP]’s attempt at the 2nd Launch, [CDM] was still not satisfied with the quality and workmanship of the construction of [the Hull], and still did not consider the launch to have been effectively carried out.

The respondent’s <span class="font-italic">primary</span> case, as the appellants themselves recognised, was that the Hull had been properly launched in January 2015. The mere fact that the full panoply of the respondent’s alternative and secondary case had not been reflected in the very brief and limited outlines in the ALOI cannot be taken to undo the fact that extensive reference had been made in relation to the second launch and the grant of approval in April 2015 in the parties’ pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Parties’ Opening Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Our conclusion above that the parties <span class="font-italic">had</span> in fact joined issue over the approval granted on 28 April 2015 for the second launch on 3 May 2015 was buttressed by the extensive arguments concerning these developments in the parties’ opening statements.

In the respondent’s reply closing submissions, it argued that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 [CDP] validly launched [the Hull] on 20 January 2015 as confirmed by the [Classification Society] Statement of Fact, which is conclusive evidence that [the Classification Society] assented to the launch. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Further</span>, the [appellants] agreed that [the Hull] would be in launching condition when [CDP] resolved its outstanding issues, which it did by 5 May 2015. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Alternatively</span>, the [appellants] are estopped from arguing that [the Hull] was not launched by 5 May 2015 because [CDP] had resolved the outstanding issues raised by the [appellants]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in bold underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Tellingly, the appellants did in fact acknowledge, at [88] of their Appellants’ Case, that this extract <span class="font-italic">did</span> cover the basis upon which the Tribunal eventually made its key findings. The appellants’ only argument in response was that “it was far too late for the [respondent] to be raising a new point in submission … which was neither pleaded nor foreshadowed”. Setting aside the fact that the pleadings, ALOI, opening statements, and evidence adduced illustrate that it cannot viably be said that the arguments over the second launch were “neither pleaded nor foreshadowed”, the appellants did not raise <span class="font-italic">any</span> jurisdictional objections <span class="font-italic">whatsoever</span> about the respondent’s reply closing submissions. The appellants’ silence in this regard was deafening.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This absence of any jurisdictional objections was perhaps unsurprising given the appellants’ <span class="font-italic">own</span> reply closing submissions at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Even if the [respondent] say[s] they [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">launched </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">[the Hull] correctly in May 2015</span>, after having completed all the outstanding works, the [respondent] had still <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">failed to request and obtain the [appellants’] consent to launch</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">compliance with all the conditions precedent under Article 6 of Addendum No. 2</span> had still not been satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in bold underline] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In a single sentence, the appellants succinctly and, ironically given their case, summed up the entire basis upon which the Tribunal eventually decided this issue. For the appellants to claim that these points had not been raised over the course of the Arbitration flies in the face of reality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellants’ arguments on the Tribunal’s alleged excess of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In support of their assertion that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in considering whether approval had been granted for the second launch of the Hull in May 2015, the appellants made three arguments. First, it was contended that the Tribunal had erred in finding that the Hull had been “launched”, as was required in Contract Addendum No. 2, as the Hull had only been “floated” or “undocked and later docked again”. Second, the appellants argued that the respondent’s <span class="font-italic">only</span> alternative argument made at the Arbitration, apart from the respondent’s primary case that the Hull had been launched in January 2015, was one arising out of estoppel. On this argument, any reference to the second launch in May 2015 pertained only to the context of estoppel, and did not provide a basis for the Tribunal to make its finding that the obligation to pay the Fourth Instalment had been triggered. Third, the appellants claimed that even if there had been reference made to the second launch and approval for the second launch, such reference was not the “crux” or “focus” of the parties’ cases in the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With respect, we did not find any of these arguments persuasive. Turning to the appellants’ first argument, it is trite that a Court determining an application to set aside an arbitral award on the basis of an alleged excess of jurisdiction is not concerned with the merits of the dispute, but only with the <span class="font-italic">process</span>. The correctness or otherwise of the tribunal’s decision is not in issue. Rather, the key question lies in determining the ambit of the tribunal’s jurisdiction. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Sui Southern Gas</span> <span class="font-italic">Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Sui Southern Gas</span>”) at [37]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) … is <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not concerned with the substantive correctness of the arbitral tribunal’s … decision</span> on a matter that was properly within its jurisdiction. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">If an issue is firmly within the scope of submission to arbitration, I fail to see how it can be taken outside the scope of submission to arbitration simply because the arbitral tribunal comes to a wrong, even manifestly wrong, conclusion on it</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in bold underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As for the appellants’ second argument, that the <span class="font-italic">only</span> alternative case pursued by the respondent in the Arbitration was one of estoppel, this was simply untrue. As is evident from the extracts above, the second launch was squarely before the Tribunal and issue had been joined by both parties on it. Moreover, the respondent’s arguments on estoppel were in an altogether different and separate segment of the relevant pleadings. Perhaps this fact is best manifested by the appellants’ counsel’s <span class="font-italic">own</span> acknowledgment (see [32] above) that the respondent’s case on the second launch had become clear from the respondent’s opening statement in the Arbitration, and the respondent’s reply closing submissions in the Arbitration (see [39] above), which unequivocally distinguished between the respondent’s alternative submission that launch had in any event occurred by May 2015, and the respondent’s <span class="font-italic">further</span> alternative case on estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The appellants’ third argument is similarly untenable. The fact that a party to arbitration has formed the view that the tribunal had decided the dispute on a matter which it perceived as not being the “focus” or “crux” of the dispute is not a basis for asserting that the tribunal had acted in excess of jurisdiction. Put simply, whether or not a particular facet of a dispute is identified by a party as being the nub of a dispute may come down to the competence and ability of counsel to sift through material and identify the central issues. Moreover, even the best-intentioned and most able counsel may find themselves blinkered in focusing only on areas which they and their clients deem to be the most significant. Accordingly, a tribunal deciding a dispute based on an issue which is allegedly not the “crux” or “focus” of the proceedings is neither here nor there so long as that issue does in fact fall within the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As was observed in <span class="font-italic">Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 114 at [51] in the context of the requirement for parties to have the opportunity to present their cases, such a requirement does <span class="font-italic">not</span> shield a party from its own failures or strategic choices not to utilise the opportunity afforded. Further, and again in the context of the requirement for parties to have the opportunity to present their cases, the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Terna Bahrain Holding </span><span class="font-italic">Company WLL v Al Shamsi &amp; ors</span> [2012] EWHC 3283 (Comm) made clear at [106] that a tribunal does not act unfairly in deciding a case on a point which was not emphasised by the party raising it, or which is not the subject matter of any great exposition. Provided the issue is raised, however briefly, the opposing party can avail itself of the opportunity it has to address the issue at whatever length and in whatever detail it so decides. We see no reason why this reasoning should not also apply where an award is challenged for excess of jurisdiction – if an issue has been submitted to the tribunal for adjudication, the fact that parties might not have made extensive submissions on it does not somehow remove that issue from the tribunal’s jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the facts of this case, the extracts from the pleadings, ALOI, opening statements, evidence adduced, and closing submissions all speak with one voice in establishing that the issues upon which the Tribunal based its decision were <span class="font-italic">categorically</span> within the ambit of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The appellants’ arguments were thus uniformly rejected. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the Tribunal act in breach of natural justice?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Given our conclusion that the Tribunal had not exceeded its jurisdiction, and the appellants’ own acknowledgment that the breach of natural justice alleged was entirely dependent on the Tribunal having in fact exceeded its jurisdiction (see [16] above), there was no need to consider the breach of natural justice alleged by the appellants in any detail. That argument was rendered unsustainable and fell <span class="font-italic">in limine</span> given that the appellants had ample opportunity to address the second launch, and did in fact do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 A significant question of law as to costs had been broached in this case. The respondent contended at first instance that it, having been successful in resisting the appellants’ attempt to set aside the Award, should be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis. While the respondent later abandoned this position at the hearing before us, following the recent decision in <span class="font-italic">BTN and another v BTP and another </span>[2021] SGHC 38 (“<span class="font-italic">BTN</span>”), we nonetheless take this opportunity to set out our brief views on whether there should be a presumption of indemnity costs in the event of an unsuccessful application for setting aside an arbitral award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In support of its position below and in its written submissions on appeal, the respondent placed reliance on two Hong Kong decisions. The first was <span class="font-italic">Pacific China Holdings Ltd (in liq) v Grand Pacific Holdings Ltd (No 2) </span>[2012] 6 HKC 40, which held that a party who was unsuccessful in an application to set aside an arbitral award should, in the absence of special circumstances, be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis. The second was <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Fully Best Trading Ltd </span>[2016] 1 HKC 149 (“<span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span>”), where the Hong Kong Court of First Instance stated at [10] that the basis of awarding costs on an indemnity basis was that parties had consensually agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration and accept the arbitral award as final and binding on them, but one party was going back on this. The respondent contended that given Singapore’s pro-arbitration policy, the courts here should adopt the Hong Kong position and award costs on an indemnity basis as the <span class="font-italic">default</span> position where an application for setting aside has failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Before we outline our views on the respondent’s contention, we pause to set out the Hong Kong position more fully. The Hong Kong courts adopt a default rule that indemnity costs will be granted when an award is unsuccessfully challenged in Court, unless special circumstances can be shown. This approach was first elucidated in <span class="font-italic">A v R</span> [2010] 3 HKC 67 (“<span class="font-italic">A v R</span>”), a decision of Anselmo Reyes J (as he then was) in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance. As Reyes J explained, there were three considerations animating this approach: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, at [67], Reyes J opined that a person who obtains an award in his favour pursuant to an arbitration agreement should be entitled to expect that a court will enforce the award as a matter of course. Hence, applications by an award debtor to appeal against or set aside an arbitral award should be regarded as exceptional events, and where such applications are unsuccessful, indemnity costs should be warranted, absent special circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, an unmeritorious challenge against an award was said (at [69]) to be incompatible with the award debtor’s duty to assist the court in the just, cost-effective, and efficient resolution of a dispute. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the award debtor should bear the full costs consequences of bringing an unsuccessful application, and the award creditor should not be made to incur costs arising from the losing party’s attempt to challenge the award, particularly when the award creditor had already won at arbitration. To illustrate this third point, Reyes J explained at [70] that “[i]f the losing party is only made to pay costs on a conventional party-and-party basis, the winning party would in effect be subsidising the losing party’s abortive attempt to frustrate enforcement of a valid award”, and would be out of pocket for the remaining amount. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 <span class="font-italic">A v R</span> was approved by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gao Haiyan and another v Keeneye </span>Holdings<span class="font-italic"> Ltd and another</span> [2012] HKCU 226 at [13]. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal also adopted the reasons set out by Reyes J. <span class="font-italic">A v R</span> was also subsequently applied in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco </span>at [10].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Hong Kong position notwithstanding, we were not persuaded that there should be a default position that an unsuccessful application to set aside will attract indemnity costs. In this regard, we noted the recent decision of Belinda Ang J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">BTN</span>, where the High Court had been invited to award indemnity costs following an unsuccessful application to set aside an arbitral award. Ang J declined to award indemnity costs, noting at [8] that it was well established in Singapore that the imposition of costs on an indemnity basis was “dependent on there being exceptional circumstances to warrant a departure from the usual course of awarding costs on a standard basis”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 We agreed with Ang J’s reasoning. While the category of “exceptional circumstances” attracting indemnity costs is not closed (see, for instance, <span class="font-italic">Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 103 (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”) at [22]–[24]), it would do violence to the notion of such circumstances having to be “exceptional” if <span class="font-italic">every</span> instance of an award being challenged unsuccessfully could be said to, at least presumptively, be an “exceptional” circumstance warranting indemnity costs. More fundamentally, such an approach is not reflective of Singapore’s approach to indemnity costs. While the Court has a broad discretion to award costs, particularly in exceptional circumstances (under O 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)), there is nothing in both the case law and the ROC which suggests that an entire <span class="font-italic">area</span> should be presumptively hived-off as attracting costs on an indemnity basis <span class="font-italic">purely</span> because of the subject matter it concerns. Rather, the assessment of whether indemnity costs are warranted turns on a highly fact-specific assessment of the <span class="font-italic">totality</span> of the facts and circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> at [18]. This is, after all, a corollary of the circumstances having to be “exceptional” before indemnity costs are warranted. Thus, rather than create a presumption that indemnity costs apply in <span class="font-italic">every</span> instance where an application to set aside has been unsuccessful, the setting-aside context should be merely one of the factors the Court takes into consideration – as it is already empowered to under O 59 r 5 of the ROC – when deciding whether or not to order indemnity costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This reasoning was underpinned by strong conceptual reasons as well. While arbitration is a distinct species of dispute-resolution, applications for setting aside, enforcement, or other relief before the courts would engage the courts’ jurisdiction. It would be neither appropriate nor permissible for parties to seek to engage the jurisdiction of the courts to set aside an award, but at the same time insist on different treatment from other cases before the courts in terms of costs. There was simply no justification for this treatment of arbitration as an altogether separate category. A party seeking relief from the Court, even if in the context of an application to set aside an arbitral award, was, like any other litigant, a party before the Court, and bound by the Court’s rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Hong Kong position proceeded on the reasoning that (a) parties to arbitration recognise arbitral awards as final and binding; (b) any challenge to arbitral awards in court would therefore be tantamount to going back on this recognition by the parties; and (c) indemnity costs should thus be ordered. With respect, we disagreed with this reasoning. It fails to recognise that the limited avenues available to challenge an arbitral award are <span class="font-italic">statutorily</span> provided for in the same way as a right of appeal against a decision of the court below. There is no principled reason to draw any distinction between the two in assessing whether exceptional circumstances exist for the purpose of awarding indemnity costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 We emphasise that in deciding whether to order indemnity costs, the Court should have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and whether a party has behaved <span class="font-italic">unreasonably</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Co of the Bank of England (No 6) </span>[2006] EWHC 816 (Comm) at [25]). Critically, “[c]osts on an indemnity basis should only be ordered in a special case or where there are exceptional circumstances” (<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties) </span>[2011] 1 SLR 582 at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For context, a case which fell within such an exceptional category was this Court’s recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v SBM Offshore NV</span> [2021] SGCA 36, where we found that there had been “deliberate material non-disclosure” (at [28]) contrary to the duty of full and frank disclosure in an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application. Worse, the non-disclosing party had completely failed to provide any explanation for the non-disclosure, save a perfunctory assertion that it was not deliberate. That party had also not been forthcoming in conceding that there had been material non-disclosure, with such acknowledgment only emerging at the end of the hearing before the Judge below. It was in such circumstances that this Court found that the non-disclosing party’s “conduct was incontrovertibly beyond the pale”. Had the respondent maintained its submission for indemnity costs, we would have found that the instant facts disclosed behaviour far less egregious than that in <span class="font-italic">Tecnomar</span>, and that the threshold for awarding costs on an indemnity basis had not been crossed.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SUPREME COURT OF SINGAPORE</strong></p>
<p>5 May 2021</p>
<p><strong>Case Summary</strong></p>
<p><em>CDM and anor v CDP </em>[2021] SGCA 45<em><br/>
Civil Appeal No 53 of 2020</em></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Steven Chong JCA):</strong></p>
<p>Outcome: Court of Appeal dismisses the appeal against the decision of the Judge below that an arbitral award should not be set aside. The appellants had sought to set the award aside on grounds of excess of jurisdiction and/or breach of natural justice. The Court of Appeal finds, in light of the parties’ pleadings, agreed list of issues (“ALOI”), evidence adduced, and submissions in the arbitration, that none of the grounds for setting aside relied on by the appellants is made out. The Court of Appeal also declines to adopt the position in Hong Kong, where there exists a default position that a party which has unsuccessfully sought to set aside an arbitral award will be liable to pay the successful party’s costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is, for the most part, defined by the pleadings filed in the arbitration. While the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim lay out the dispute from the claimant’s perspective, it would be incorrect to treat them as <em>exhaustively </em>defining the jurisdiction of the tribunal: at <strong>[1]</strong>.</li>
<li>The fact that a party to arbitration has formed the view that the tribunal had decided the dispute on a matter which it perceived as not being the “focus” or “crux” of the dispute is not a basis for asserting that the tribunal had acted in excess of jurisdiction: at <strong>[44]</strong>.</li>
<li>While the category of “exceptional circumstances” attracting indemnity costs is not closed, it would do violence to the notion of such circumstances having to be “exceptional” if <em>every</em> instance of an award being challenged unsuccessfully could be said to, at least presumptively, be an “exceptional” circumstance warranting indemnity costs. More fundamentally, such an approach is not reflective of Singapore’s approach to indemnity costs. Thus, rather than create a presumption that indemnity costs apply in <em>every</em> instance where an application to set aside has been unsuccessful, the setting-aside context should be merely one of the factors the Court takes into consideration when deciding whether or not to order indemnity costs: at <strong>[53]</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background to the appeal</strong></p>
<p>1.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellants and respondent entered into the following agreements on 9 June 2013:
</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a. A contract (“the Contract”) between the first appellant and the respondent where the respondent agreed to design, build, launch, equip, commission, test, complete, sell, and deliver to the first appellant a Self-Erected Tender Rig and a Derrick Equipment Set (collectively, the “Hull”); and</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>b. A company guarantee by the second appellant in favour of the respondent in respect of the Contract.</p>
<p>2.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>After having entered into the Contract, the parties entered into a number of addenda to the contract. Addendum No. 2 was entered into on 24 September 2014. Of central importance to the present appeal is Article 6(d) of Addendum No. 2, which varied the payment term in the Contract such that 10% of the total contract sum (the “Fourth Instalment”) would become payable upon “launching and receipt of [the] invoice issued by the [respondent-builder]”. A further stipulation in Addendum No. 2 provided that “launching [was] subject to prior approval by the [ship classification society], [the first appellant], and [the respondent] collectively”.</p>
<p>3.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 20 January 2015, the respondent purported to launch the Hull into the water for the purposes of Art 6(d) of Addendum No. 2. That same day, the first appellant’s project manager emailed the respondent stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that it “[did] not consider the floating as launching”. Following the disputed launch on 20 January, various meetings involving the parties’ representatives were held on 21 January, 7 April, and 28 April 2015 (collectively, the “Construction and Progress Meetings”). The purpose of the Construction and Progress Meetings was, among other things, to iron out and update various outstanding items or deficiencies in the construction of the Hull that the first appellant required the respondent to remedy. It was the respondent’s position that by 28 April 2015, all outstanding issues and/or deficiencies in relation to the Hull had been resolved.</p>
<p>4.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>On 3 May 2015, the Hull was launched (the “second launch”). On 5 May 2015, the respondent demanded payment of the Fourth Instalment. As payment continued to be withheld, the respondent issued a default notice on 3 August 2016 pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee requesting that the appellants pay the Fourth Instalment. As payment was still not forthcoming, the respondent commenced arbitral proceedings (the “Arbitration”) against the appellants. The Notice of Arbitration was filed on 26 September 2016. Following the usual exchange of pleadings, an oral hearing took place between 21 and 25 May 2018, where both sides called factual and expert witnesses. Thereafter, detailed written closing and reply submissions were exchanged.</p>
<p>5.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The central issue in question at the Arbitration was, for present purposes, whether the respondent (the claimant in the Arbitration) was entitled to the Fourth Instalment. The Tribunal found that the respondent, first appellant, and the relevant ship classification society had collectively given their approval for the launch of the Hull, with the first appellant having given its approval on 28 April 2015 for the second launch on 3 May 2015. The Tribunal found that the minutes of the Construction and Progress Meetings that took place on 7 and 28 April 2015 recorded that the respondent had resolved all the remaining items which the first appellant required the respondent to remedy before the Hull was considered to be in “[l]aunching condition”. The Tribunal also found that the minutes recorded the first appellant’s clear acceptance that the outstanding requirements had been met. By its acceptance that the outstanding issues had been resolved, the Tribunal found that the first appellant had also given its approval for the second launch. The Tribunal thus found that there was no valid reason for the appellants to withhold payment of the Fourth Instalment. Accordingly, in its award (the “Award”), the Tribunal ordered the appellants to, <em>inter alia</em>, pay the respondent the sum of US$13.9m (<em>ie </em>the Fourth Instalment) with interest.</p>
<p>6.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellants then applied to set aside the part of the Award relating to the respondent’s claim for the Fourth Instalment under the Contract:
</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a. First, relying on Article 34(2)<em>(a)</em>(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the “IAA”), the appellants argued that the Award had been made in excess of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>b. Second, the appellants alleged that the Award had been made in breach of the right to present their case, in violation of Article 34(2)<em>(a)</em>(ii) of the Model Law and/or in breach of the rules of natural justice, in violation of s 24<em>(b)</em> of the IAA.</p>
<p>7.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Judge dismissed all of the appellants’ attempts to impugn the Award in their entirety, finding that they were not borne out by the record from the Arbitration. The appellants appealed, making two broad arguments:
</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a. First, that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction in finding that there had been the requisite approval in April 2015 for the second launch of the Hull in May 2015. Accordingly, the Tribunal had also exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the Fourth Instalment had fallen due.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>b. Second, that the Tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice and the appellants’ right to be heard because the ground that the Tribunal had relied on, <em>ie</em> that approval had been given for the <em>second</em> launch, was not in issue in the Arbitration. Accordingly, the appellants had been denied the opportunity to present their case on that issue.</p>
<p><strong>The Court of Appeal's decision</strong></p>
<p>8.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal dismissed CA 53 of 2020.</p>
<p>9.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>While the appellants relied on (a) an excess of jurisdiction and/or (b) a breach of natural justice to justify setting aside the impugned segments of the Award, the factual matrix for <em>both</em> grounds was in fact identical. Put another way, the breach of natural justice alleged by the appellants <em>required</em> the Tribunal to have exceeded its jurisdiction, because the appellants accept that if they had the opportunity to engage the issues which had in fact been placed before the Tribunal, it would follow that the Tribunal could not have acted in excess of jurisdiction. Thus, the appellants failing to establish that the Tribunal had acted in excess of its jurisdiction would necessarily be fatal to their breach of natural justice argument: at <strong>[16]</strong>.</p>
<p>10.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The question of what matters were within the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration was answerable by reference to five sources: the parties’ pleadings, ALOI, opening statements, evidence adduced, and closing submissions at the Arbitration. Having reference to those sources, it was clear beyond peradventure that the issue as to whether the parties had approved the second launch such that the Fourth Instalment became payable was squarely before the Tribunal. There was thus no basis to contend that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in making that finding: at <strong>[18]</strong>.</p>
<p>11.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellants made three arguments in support of their assertion that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction in considering whether approval had been granted for the launch of the Hull in May 2015. First, it was contended that the Tribunal had erred in finding that the Hull had been “launched”, as was required in Contract Addendum No. 2, as the Hull had only been “floated” or “undocked and later docked again”. Second, the appellants argued that the respondent’s <em>only</em> alternative argument made at the Arbitration, apart from the respondent’s primary case that the Hull had been launched in January 2015, was one arising out of estoppel. On this argument, any reference to the launch in May 2015 pertained only to the context of estoppel, and did not provide a basis for the Tribunal to make its finding that the obligation to pay the Fourth Instalment had been triggered. Third, the appellants claimed that even if there had been reference made to the second launch and approval for the second launch, such reference was not the “crux” or “focus” of the parties’ cases in the Arbitration: at <strong>[41]</strong>.</p>
<p>12.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>None of the appellants’ arguments was persuasive:
</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>a. Turning to the appellants’ first argument, it is trite that a Court determining an application to set aside an arbitral award on the basis of an alleged excess of jurisdiction is not concerned with the merits of the dispute, but only with the <em>process</em>. The correctness or otherwise of the tribunal’s decision is not in issue. Rather, the key question lies in determining the ambit of the tribunal’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>b. As for the appellants’ second argument, that the <em>only</em> alternative case pursued by the respondent in the Arbitration was one of estoppel, this was simply untrue. As is evident from the extracts above, the second launch was squarely before the Tribunal and issue had been joined by both parties on it. Moreover, the respondent’s arguments on estoppel were in an altogether different and separate segment of the relevant pleadings.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>c. The appellants’ third argument is similarly untenable. The fact that a party to arbitration has formed the view that the tribunal had decided the dispute on a matter which it perceived as not being the “focus” or “crux” of the dispute is not a basis for asserting that the tribunal has acted in excess of jurisdiction. Whether or not a particular facet of a dispute is identified by a party as being the nub of a dispute may come down to the competence and ability of counsel to sift through material and identify the central issues. Moreover, even the best-intentioned and most able counsel may find themselves blinkered in focusing only on areas which they and their clients deem to be the most significant. Accordingly, a tribunal deciding a dispute based on an issue which is allegedly not the “crux” or “focus” of the proceedings is neither here nor there so long as that issue does in fact fall within the scope of parties’ submission to arbitration: at <strong>[42]–[44]</strong>.</p>
<p>13.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>If an issue has been submitted to the tribunal for adjudication, the fact that parties might not have made extensive submissions on it does not somehow remove that issue from the tribunal’s jurisdiction: at <strong>[45]</strong>.</p>
<p>14.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Given the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the Tribunal had not exceeded its jurisdiction, there was no need to consider the breach of natural justice alleged by the appellants in any detail. That argument was rendered unsustainable and fell <em>in limine</em> given that the appellants had ample opportunity to address the second launch, and did in fact do so: at <strong>[47]</strong>.</p>
<p>15.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court then considered whether there should be a presumption of indemnity costs in the event of an unsuccessful application for setting aside an arbitral award. A number of Hong Kong cases had taken the position that there should be such a presumption. The respondent in this case had sought costs on an indemnity basis below, though it withdrew that submission on appeal: at <strong>[48]–[51]</strong>.</p>
<p>16.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that there should be a default position that an unsuccessful application to set aside will attract indemnity costs. It adopted the reasoning of Belinda Ang J in <em>BTN and another v BTP and another </em>[2021] SGHC 38, that it was well established in Singapore that the imposition of costs on an indemnity basis was “dependent on there being exceptional circumstances to warrant a departure from the usual course of awarding costs on a standard basis”: at <strong>[52]</strong>.</p>
<p>17.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>While the Court has a broad discretion to award costs, particularly in exceptional circumstances (under O 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)), there is nothing in both the caselaw and the ROC which suggests that an entire <em>area</em> should be presumptively hived-off as attracting costs on an indemnity basis <em>purely</em> because of the subject matter it concerns. Rather, the assessment of whether indemnity costs are warranted turns on a highly fact-specific assessment of the <em>totality</em> of the facts and circumstances. This is, after all, a corollary of the circumstances having to be “exceptional” before indemnity costs are warranted. While arbitration is a distinct species of dispute-resolution, applications for setting aside, enforcement, or other relief before the courts would engage the courts’ jurisdiction. It would be neither appropriate nor permissible for parties to seek to engage the jurisdiction of the courts to set aside an award, but at the same time insist on different treatment from other cases before the courts in terms of costs. A party seeking relief from the Court, even if in the context of an application to set aside an arbitral award, was, like any other litigant, a party before the Court, and bound by the Court’s rules: at <strong>[53]–[54]</strong>.</p>
<p>18.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Moreover, the Hong Kong position fails to recognise that the limited avenues available to challenge an arbitral award are <em>statutorily</em> provided for in the same way as a right of appeal against a decision of the court below. There is no principled reason to draw any distinction between the two in assessing whether exceptional circumstances exist for the purpose of awarding indemnity costs. In deciding whether to order indemnity costs, the Court should have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and whether a party has behaved <em>unreasonably</em>. Had the respondent maintained its submission for costs on an indemnity basis, the Court of Appeal would have found that the threshold for awarding costs on an indemnity basis had not been crossed : at <strong>[55]–[57]</strong>.</p>
