</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">        The appellant was tried in

the district courts on two charges of employing illegal immigrants under s 57(1)(e) of the

Immigration Act (Cap 133) at his stall in Tekkar Market. The first charge related to his

employment of Md Serajul Islam ("Md Serajul"), a Bangladeshi, for the period

between 4 August and 23 August 2001. The second charge related to his employment of an

Indian national, Sheikh Abdullah, between 15 August and 23 August 2001.  The

appellant was convicted on both charges and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on

each charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently. I dismissed his appeal

against conviction and affirmed the sentences imposed. I now give my reasons.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Background facts</p></i>
<p align="justify">2        The appellant ran a stall

"Haji MM Shahul Hameed" in Tekkar Market, selling fresh mutton. His stall stood

back-to-back with another mutton stall, "Johara Mutton Stall". Both stalls were

separated only by a narrow space which was used between them as a common working area.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        Johara Mutton Stall was

licensed to one Mdm Joharabee. She gave evidence that she was in India from July to

September 2001 and that her stall was closed during her absence. Prior to that, between

January and May 2001, she had employed an assistant named "Nagore" who would run

the stall on her behalf. It was the unchallenged evidence of Mdm Joharabee that Nagore had

stopped working for her since May 2001 and had returned to India.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">The prosecution’s case</p></i>
<p align="justify">4        On 23 August 2001, at about

7:00am, Sheikh Abdullah was observed by Jailani Abdul Kadir, an employment inspector of

the Ministry of Manpower, ("MOM"), to be putting some mutton into a plastic

basket just in front of "Johara Mutton Stall". Jailani Abdul Kadir also observed

Md Serajul handling mutton, in the common working area between the appellant’s stall

and the Johara Mutton Stall. According to him, Md Serajul, who had a piece of mutton in

front of him and a chopper by his side, looked poised to cut the meat into smaller pieces.

There was no one supervising Md Serajul and Sheikh Abdullah, who were observed to be the

only two persons present at the stall that morning. Jailani Abdul Kadir subsequently

arrested Sheikh Abdullah, while Md Serajul was arrested by another employment inspector of

MOM. The two MOM inspectors gave evidence that upon their arrest, both immigration

offenders told them that they worked for the "Johara Mutton Stall" and that

their boss was away in India.</p>
<p align="justify">5        Md Serajul subsequently

testified that he was working for the appellant for about 17-18 days prior to his arrest.

He had found employment at the appellant’s stall through a friend ‘Amir’

sometime in August. Amir had informed him that the appellant would pay him $30 a day to

work at his stall from 7am to 10pm. On his first day at work, the appellant informed him

that his scope of work included cleaning the shop, clearing the rubbish, delivering meat

to various shops in Serangoon as well as "managing" the Bangladeshi customers

who frequented the stalls. He testified that during the period of his employment, he

worked in the common working area between the appellant’s stall and the Johara Mutton

Stall. According to him, the appellant paid him $100 about 10-12 days later for the work

done and promised to give him the remaining monies later. Md Serajul also stated that he

had told the appellant that he was a Bangladeshi National who entered Singapore from

Malaysia.</p>
<p align="justify">6        Sheikh Abdullah also

testified that it was the appellant who employed him and that he had been working for the

appellant for about a week prior to his arrest. He gave evidence that it was only after

his third attempt in asking for work that the appellant employed him to work at his stall

from 6am to 1pm. On the first occasion, he asked for a job but was turned down. At their

next encounter, one week later, he asked the appellant for a job again. This time round,

the appellant told him to come back and see him one week later. During this third

occasion, the appellant asked to see his work permit. Sheikh Abdullah then showed him a

forged, photocopied work permit. He lied to the appellant that the original permit was

with his company and that the name on the work permit was his. As the appellant did not

ask any further questions about his immigration status nor ask to see any other documents,

Sheikh Abdullah assumed that the appellant had believed his story. It was only when he

started work one week later that he told the appellant he was an Indian national. The

appellant did not ask him to produce further identification papers at any time after

starting work. He also testified that it was the appellant who would personally pay him

his daily wage of $20 every day of that week except on the day he was arrested.</p></font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defence</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">7        The appellant’s

defence was one of denial. He denied knowing either of the immigration offenders and

denied having employed them at his stall. According to him, there was already sufficient

help at the stall. He employed two workers, one Yusoff, a Singaporean and one Abdul

Kuthoos, a permanent resident. In addition, his son, a polytechnic student, would help out

at the stall in the afternoon if he did not have any classes. In this connection, the

appellant argued that he would not have hired additional workers as he already had

sufficient manpower. The appellant also claimed that the immigration offenders had

colluded to falsely implicate him so that they could prolong their stay in Singapore and

obtain a special pass by testifying against him. The appellant even went so far as to

suggest that the true employer of the immigration offenders was either Joharabee or her

assistant, Nagore.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></i>
<p align="justify">8        The trial judge ruled that,

since the immigration offenders were found in the vicinity of the Johara Mutton Stall and

that there was no evidence of the appellant having actual "charge, management or

control" of the premises where they were found, the fairest thing to do would be to

assess the evidence on the basis that the presumption in s 57(8) of the Immigration Act

did not operate. This was notwithstanding that she was of the opinion that it was arguable

that <i>de facto</i> control by the appellant of the premises could be inferred – a

point which the prosecution had failed to argue.</p>
<p align="justify">9        At the close of the trial,

the trial judge found the appellant to be disingenuous and even far-fetched. She

disbelieved his defence as well as the appellant’s other witnesses whom she found

lacking in impartiality. In contrast, the trial judge found Md Serajul and Sheikh Abdullah

to be honest and credible witnesses. She accepted their evidence in relation to their

employment by the appellant and found that, based on their account, the appellant had

reasonable grounds to believe that Md Serajul and Sheikh Abdullah were immigration

offenders. </p>
<p align="justify">10        As the trial judge was

satisfied that the two charges against the appellant were proven beyond all reasonable

doubt, she convicted him of them.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify">11        The appellant appealed

against his conviction and sentence. His main ground of appeal was that the trial judge

had erred in finding that the prosecution had proven beyond all reasonable doubt his

employment of the two immigration offenders as well as the necessary <i>mens rea</i>

vis--vis their immigration status. As the appeal turned entirely on the findings of fact

made by the trial judge, the main issue was whether the trial judge’s findings were

clearly against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the immigration offenders were credible witnesses</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">12        According to the

appellant, the trial judge had clearly erred in accepting and relying upon the evidence of

the immigration offenders. This was because their evidence was fraught with serious and

material inconsistencies, which, in turn, impacted on their credibility as witnesses. The

appellant also attacked the credibility of the immigration offenders on the basis that

they had an ulterior motive to implicate him.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The discrepancies</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        In his written submission,

the appellant highlighted a number of discrepancies in the evidence of both immigration

offenders that he considered to be of a "serious and material" nature. On the

basis of these discrepancies, the appellant contended that the evidence of the immigration

offenders should, as a whole, be rejected. Having reviewed the evidence before me, I found

these discrepancies to be either of a minor nature, in that they had no direct bearing on

the facts in issue, or could be satisfactorily explained. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        Assessing the evidence of

each immigration offender in turn, the alleged discrepancies relating to Md Serajul’s

account were as follows: </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i    Md Serajul had denied that the appellant was his

    employer when the appellant had confronted him about it in the police lock-up in the

    presence of three police officers; </p>
<p align="justify">ii    Md Serajul’s evidence that he was harboured

    at 120A Rowell Road was contradicted by other evidence; and</p>
<p align="justify">iii    Md Serajul’s evidence that he and Sheikh

    Abdullah were arrested with another person named "Sedak" was contradicted by the

    evidence of the MOM inspectors.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        The appellant’s claim

that Md Serajul had retracted his allegation in the police lock-up was firmly denied by Md

Serajul, who testified that even though he had seen the appellant whilst in the lock-up on

24 August 2001, he had not engaged in any conversation with him. In my opinion, the trial

judge had good reasons to prefer Md Serajul’s account over that of the appellant.

First, as she had aptly pointed out, no attempt was made by the appellant to put these

allegations to police witnesses during the main trial. Secondly, it would be highly

improbable for the police to have allowed the appellant, an accused person, to speak with

and question a key witness at the police lock-up, especially when investigations were

still ongoing.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">16        At the trial below, the

appellant had attempted to discredit Md Serajul on the basis that Md Serajul had tried to

frame the appellant by maliciously fabricating a story about being harboured by the

appellant at the residence of his sister at Rowell Road. In support of his contention, the

appellant called upon his sister, Naina and one Bahurdeen Kader Beevi

("Bahurdeen") who worked as a maid in one of the residences to which Md Serajul

was said to have brought the police. Barhudeen gave a confused account of a

"person" being brought to the flat by police officers. As it turned out,

Barhudeen’s account was based on what she had heard through her employers. As such,

her evidence was hearsay and could not be relied upon. Naina testified that Md Serajul

brought some police officers to show them the flat in which he had stayed and had wrongly

identified her flat as being the one where he had stayed. The trial judge held that all

that Naina’s evidence could establish was that Md Serajul had made a mistake in

identifying the flat where he had stayed for a few days. This was plausible given that he

was brought to the flat by a co-worker named "Sedak" and had only stayed in the

flat for a few days. </p>
<p align="justify">17        In a similar vein, the

appellant also sought to discredit Md Serajul on the basis that he had lied about the

existence of a person named "Sedak" who was a co-worker at the stall. The

appellant’s argument had been canvassed before the trial judge who found that the

available evidence did not in the least contradict Md Serajul’s claim about there

being two Indians working at the appellant’s stall – Sheikh Abdullah and one

other whom he knew as "Sedak". In the circumstance, she was of the opinion that

Md Serajul’s flawed recollection of having being arrested with Sedak was

understandable in light of the shock and confusion Md Serajul must have experienced at the

time of his arrest. </p>
<p align="justify">18        Having reviewed the

evidence before me and bearing in mind the trial judge’s advantage of having had the

opportunity of observing the demeanour of the witnesses under cross-examination, I did not

consider the trial judge’s findings of fact and her decision to attach little weight

to these discrepancies to be against the weight of the evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">19        In relation to the

evidence of Sheikh Abdullah, the appellant highlighted the following discrepancies: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i Sheikh Abdullah had given a very confused and inconsistent account of

    the dates pertaining to his entry into Singapore and his subsequent employment by the

    appellant; and</p>
<p align="justify">ii Sheikh Abdullah’s evidence that he had surrendered his

    photocopied work permit to the MOM inspectors during his arrest was not consistent with

    the evidence of the MOM inspectors.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">20        According to the

appellant, the fact that Sheikh Abdullah had contradicted himself many times in his

evidence regarding his estimation of the dates at which he had entered Singapore and his

subsequent employment by the appellant, served to undermine his credibility as a witness.

Given that these events took place more than a year ago, I found that these discrepancies

were really a result of human fallibility in retention and recollection, and amounted to

nothing more than minor inconsistencies. In any event, considering that the

appellant’s defence was not one of alibi but one of total denial, Sheikh

Abdullah’s inability to recall the exact dates did not impinge upon the material

aspects of his evidence. In this regard, Sheikh Abdullah gave very clear and cogent

evidence about his employment by the appellant, which was also corroborated by the

evidence of Md Serajul. </p>
<p align="justify">21        While the second

discrepancy relating to Sheikh Abdullah’s evidence was immaterial in that it did not

relate directly to the facts in issue, the appellant contended that it must be taken to be

a deliberate concoction, which militated against the credibility of Sheikh Abdullah. It

should be noted that, even if Sheikh Abdullah had lied about the eventual whereabouts of

his work permit, this did not mean that his evidence must be rejected as a whole. It is a

well-established principle that a court may accept one part of a witness’ testimony

whilst rejecting another part: <i>Sundra Moorthy Lankatharan v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11130&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 464</a>, <i>Ng

Kwee Leong v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47168&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 942</a>. I was satisfied that the trial judge gave due

consideration to this inconsistent aspect of Sheikh Abdullah evidence in assessing the

veracity of his evidence as a whole. Accordingly, I was not willing to disturb her

findings of fact.</p>
<p align="justify">22        Another discrepancy that

the appellant had emphasised was that the immigration offenders had, upon their arrest,

informed the MOM inspectors that they were employed by the boss of "Johara Mutton

Stall" who was away in India. The trial judge who noted that the immigration

offenders had remained consistent in their stand that the appellant had employed them

despite vigorous cross-examination, accepted the immigration offenders explanation that

they had "babbled" the above statement in the midst of fear and confusion when

they were arrested. I found this explanation to be plausible and consistent with the

surrounding evidence.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Ulterior motive to implicate the appellant</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">23        The appellant also claimed

that the immigration offenders had colluded to implicate him as they had an ulterior

motive to "ingratiate themselves with the prosecution and wily nily find ways to

lengthen their stay in Singapore". I found his claim to be of no merit whatsoever.</p>
<p align="justify">24        Not only did the appellant

fail to produce any evidence of this alleged collusion between the immigration offenders,

both immigration offenders were in fact already serving their one-year terms of

imprisonment at the time when they testified at the trial. They clearly had nothing to

gain in laying false allegations against the appellant once they were caught by the

immigration authorities. In addition, they would risk being punished for offences of

perjury and giving false information if they were exposed for telling lies against the

appellant who claimed to be a relatively "well-known" stall-holder.</p>
<p align="justify">25        Having reviewed the

evidence in light of the alleged discrepancies and collusion, I was even more convinced

that the trial judge had treated the evidence of the immigration offenders with the

necessary caution in assessing whether the prosecution’s case was proven beyond

reasonable doubt. In my judgement, her findings as to the consistency of the immigration

offenders’ evidence were also supported by the independent evidence of the MOM

inspectors who testified that these immigration offenders were found in the early hours of

the morning, within the immediate vicinity of the appellant’s stall, handling meat.

The photographs tendered in evidence also showed that the appellant’s stall was the

only mutton stall, in the immediate vicinity of where the immigration offenders were

observed to be working, that was open at the time. It was also patently clear from the

photographs that, although Sheikh Abdullah was observed to be handling meat in front of

the Johara Mutton Stall, the stall was closed at the material time. In fact, it was the

unchallenged evidence of Mdm Joharabee that her stall had been closed since May 2001.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the appellant’s defence should have been rejected</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">26        The appellant argued that

the trial judge was wrong in rejecting his defence and giving little weight to the

evidence of the defence witnesses. He further submitted that, in so doing, the trial judge

had ignored the fact that, until the point of their arrest that morning, no one was

observed to be supervising the immigration offenders who were positioned nearer the

vicinity of the Johara Mutton Stall than of the appellant’s stall. </p>
<p align="justify">27        The appellant’s

defence was one of total denial. It was his position that he had never had any dealings

with the immigration offenders. He also tried to reason that he was not in need of any

additional workers apart from Yusoff, Abdul Kuthoos and his son. His claims, however, were

shown to be untrue in light of the evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">28        In relation to his first

claim, the appellant was unable to provide a valid explanation for why the immigration

offenders were privy to the personal details of the appellant. Not only did they know that

the appellant’s name was "Mustafa" and that he came into work at 9 am every

morning, they also knew who "Yusoff" was and that he was a Singaporean Malay.

Furthermore, Sheikh Abdullah even knew that the appellant would do the accounting for his

business at the stall. I found that the immigration offenders’ familiarity with these

details were, at the very least, inconsistent with the appellant’s claim that he had

had no dealings with the immigration offenders.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        More telling of the

untruthfulness of the appellant’s claim of having had no dealings with the

immigration offenders, was his inability to provide a reasonable explanation as to why the

immigration offenders were seen at 7 am in the morning near the vicinity of his stall

handling meat. One explanation which he provided was that the space between his stall and

the Johara Mutton Stall was a public passageway where anyone could come and go as they

pleased. From the photographs of the stalls tendered in evidence, it was patently clear to

me that this was not true. Not only was this so called "passageway" between the

stalls extremely narrow, the "passageway" appeared to be a common working area

shared by both stall operators. In relation to his other explanation that the immigration

offenders were employed by the Johara Mutton Stall, I found that it contained no merit,

for the simple reason that it was the unchallenged evidence of Mdm Joharabee that she had

closed her stall in May 2001 and that Nagore had stopped working for her since then. As

for the fact that the immigration offenders were seen handling meat nearer the Johara

Mutton Stall than the appellant’s stall, I did not think it inconceivable for the

appellant and his workers to take the opportunity to utilise the space at the Johara

Mutton Stall, considering that it had been closed since May 2001.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">30        The appellant’s

second claim that he did not require additional workers was thoroughly examined by the

trial judge and rejected. The appellant himself was away from the stall for the greater

part of the afternoon; Yusoff only worked at the stall two or three days a week and

usually left by the afternoon; the appellant’s son only worked on a part-time basis

whenever his commitments in school would allow for it; as for Abdul Kuthoos, the

appellant’s evidence that Abdul Kuthoos worked six days a week and only took an

off-day each Monday, was contradicted by the appellant’s subsequent testimony that

Abdul Kuthoos was not working on 23 August 2001, a Thursday. Moreover, neither Yusoff nor

Abdul Kuthoos spoke Bengali. This meant that in the absence of the appellant and his son,

there was no one else capable of dealing with the Bangladeshi customers who frequented the

stall. Based on the above evidence, I did not find it improbable that the appellant would

be in need of additional workers. </p>
<p align="justify">31        In fact, I found that the

appellant’s claims, coupled with his inability to back them with proper evidence,

only served to reveal his inconsistent stand and no doubt led the trial judge to form the

opinion that he was "disingenuous, and even far fetched".</p>
<p align="justify">32        In so far as the three

defence witness were concerned, I agreed with the trial judge that their evidence was of

little use to the appellant. The evidence of Naina, the appellant’s sister, was

relevant mainly to disprove Md Serajul’s allegation that he had been harboured by the

appellant at his sister’s residence. Vejakahumar gave evidence that he did not see

either of the immigration offenders working at the appellant’s stall whenever he

delivered mutton to the appellant. The trial judge was of the opinion that he was an

interested witness as he was a good friend of the appellant and came across as being very

protective of the appellant. The third defence witness, Yusoff, gave evidence that the

immigration offenders were not fellow employees at the appellant’s stall. After a

careful review of Yusoff’s evidence, the trial judge found that it was "rife

with internal inconsistencies" and ruled that it was unreliable and of little value.

Based on the available evidence, I found the trial judge to be justified in her findings.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Appeal against sentence</p></i>
<p align="justify">33        Apart from stating that he

found his sentence of 12 months imprisonment per charge to be manifestly excessive, he did

not furnish any reasons in support of his contention.</p>
<p align="justify">34        In light of the fact that

the benchmark sentence for an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act has been

raised from six months to twelve months, I did not find the prescribed sentence of 12

months per charge to be manifestly excessive on the facts of his case. This was especially

since the terms of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently making it a total of 12

months imprisonment for both charges.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify">35        This was an appeal that

turned entirely on the findings of fact by the trial judge. Having reviewed the evidence

before me, and taking into account the discrepancies raised by the appellant, I was

satisfied that the trial judge was fully justified in choosing to accept the evidence of

the immigration offenders over the appellant’s evidence. In the circumstances, I

found no reason to disturb her findings of fact, and accordingly dismissed the appeal

against conviction and sentence.</p>
