<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal is brought by the Appellant, a
                    Singapore registered Traditional Chinese Medicine (“TCM”)
                    practitioner, against the decision of the Respondent, the Traditional Chinese
                    Medicine Practitioners Board (“the Board”), to cancel the
                    Appellant’s registration as a TCM practitioner. The Board’s decision
                    was made on 19 March 2008 after considering the findings and recommendations of
                    the Investigation Committee No. 2005/1 (“IC 2005/1”) in respect of
                    three complaints made against the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The complaints made against the Appellant were
                    as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The first complaint was by Ms Eileen Tan Hui
                            Kim to the Board on 1 July 2004 concerning allegedly questionable
                            medical treatment rendered by the Appellant on her late father
                            (“the Patient”) at the Appellant’s clinic in Johor
                            Baru, Malaysia (“the Johor Clinic”). In addition, the
                            first complaint also dealt with the Appellant’s conduct in
                            allegedly shouting and yelling at her late father’s relatives
                            during the treatment.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The second complaint was submitted by the Health
                            Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 5 January 2007 in
                            respect of the Appellant’s conviction under section 5 of the
                            Poisons Act (Cap 234) for possessing scheduled poisons for sale without
                            a valid licence. The Appellant faced seven charges but the HSA proceeded
                            on four out of the seven charges, with the remaining three charges taken
                            into consideration for sentencing. The Appellant pleaded guilty and was
                            convicted and fined a total of $10,000.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The third complaint was made by the Board on 10
                            August 2007 in respect of the Appellant’s failure to keep proper
                            and accurate medical records of the Patient’s treatment at the
                            Appellant’s Rochor Clinic in Singapore as required under
                            Regulation 3 of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners
                            (Practice, Conduct and Ethics) Regulations (Cap. 333A, Section
                            14(4)).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The findings of IC 2005/1 were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in respect of the first complaint, the Appellant
                            had performed improper treatment on the Patient and was guilty of
                            professional misconduct under section 19(1)(i) of the Traditional
                            Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act (Cap. 333A) (“the TCM
                            Act”). The allegations concerning the Appellant’s rude
                            behaviour were not made out.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">for the second complaint, the Appellant’s
                            conviction under the Poisons Act implied a defect in character which
                            rendered him unfit to practise under section 19(1)(h) of the TCM Act
                            because he had prescribed medicines other than TCM medicines to his
                            patients and deliberately flouted the law by possessing the scheduled
                            poisons for sale, thereby endangering the welfare and safety of patients
                            and members of the public.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">concerning the third complaint, the Appellant had
                            admitted during the inquiry hearing that he did not keep proper records
                            of the Patient’s treatment at the Rochor Clinic and such conduct
                            fell within section 19(1)(f) of the TCM Act.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the light of its findings, IC 2005/1, in a
                    report dated 28 January 2008 (“the Report”), recommended that
                    the Appellant’s registration as a TCM practitioner be cancelled. The Board
                    informed the Appellant of its inclination to accept IC 2005/1’s
                    recommendations and invited him to make representations before it on
                    28 February 2008. After that hearing, on 19 March 2008, the Board
                    informed the Appellant that it was exercising its power under section 19(1)
                    of the TCM Act to cancel his registration as a TCM practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant, who is also a TCM practitioner in
                    Malaysia, accepted the decision of the Board in agreeing with IC 2005/1’s
                    findings in respect of the second and third complaints. However, being
                    dissatisfied with the Board’s decision to accept IC 2005/1’s
                    findings on the first complaint and with the Board’s decision to cancel
                    his registration as a TCM practitioner, the Appellant filed this appeal on the
                    following grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Board erred in taking into account the
                            Appellant’s treatment of the Patient at the Johor Clinic in
                            determining if he was guilty of professional misconduct under section
                            19(1)(i) of the TCM Act;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Board erred in finding that the
                            Appellant’s treatment of the Patient at the Johor Clinic was
                            against TCM practice and that it amounted to professional misconduct
                            under section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Board’s decision to cancel the
                            Appellant’s registration as a TCM practitioner was manifestly
                            excessive punishment and he should have been fined or suspended
                            instead.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As the grounds of the Appellant’s appeal
                    relate to the Board’s findings with regards to the first complaint, I
                    shall start by stating some of the salient facts concerning the
                    Appellant’s treatment of the Patient at the Johor Clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Essentially, the Patient had been diagnosed with
                    terminal rectal cancer in late 2002 and was being treated by doctors from the
                    Singapore General Hospital. In 2003, these doctors indicated to the Patient and
                    his family that he had only three more months to live.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In January 2004, the Patient’s family
                    approached the Appellant at his Rochor Clinic located at Block 1 Rochor Road,
                    #02-528 Rochor Centre, Singapore 180001 to seek alternative treatment in order
                    to prolong the Patient’s life and to relieve the symptoms of his illness.
                    The Appellant agreed to provide medical services to the Patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sometime in 2004, the Appellant informed the
                    Patient and his family that he also operated a clinic in Johor and that he had
                    certain special equipment there that might be able to help the Patient. The
                    Patient agreed to go to the Johor clinic for treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the occasions when the Patient was treated
                    by the Appellant at the Johor Clinic, the Appellant performed the following
                    treatments on him:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">On or around March 24 2004, the Appellant applied
                            some form of soft gelatin on the Patient’s stomach. He then used
                            an ultra sound therapy machine to sweep over the Patient’s
                            stomach.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Patient’s family members testified that
                            the Appellant administered certain injections on the Patient on multiple
                            occasions, including once at the Johor Clinic on 13 May 2004. .
                            Although the Appellant denied having administered these injections,
                            large quantities of syringes and needles were found in the Rochor clinic
                            when a joint inspection was done by the Board with HSA officers on
                            25 February 2005.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">On or around 4 June 2004, the Appellant used
                            an “electro-thermal needle” machine (“the
                            “Machine’) on the Patient. This consisted of a machine
                            heated needle that was inserted into the Patient’s tumour
                            area.</div>

<p class="Judg-1">There is nothing in section 19(1)(i) indicating whether the phrase
                    “professional misconduct or negligence” is confined to acts
                    committed within Singapore by a TCM practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Accordingly, the point of contention between
                    the parties was whether section 19(1) of the TCM Act allows the Board to
                    take into account the Appellant’s treatment of the Patient at the Johor
                    Clinic for the purposes of determining whether he was guilty of professional
                    misconduct. Due to the significance of this determination for future cases under
                    section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act and for disciplinary tribunals constituted
                    under other Acts where similar wording appears, Ms Koh Swee Yen (“Ms
                    Koh”) was invited as <em>amicus curiae</em> to make
                    submissions on this specific issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The essence of the Appellant’s
                    submissions was that section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act did not apply to acts
                    committed by a TCM practitioner outside Singapore. In support of this, he
                    invoked the following arguments.</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It is a well known principle of statutory
                            interpretation that a statute is not to be interpreted as having
                            extra-territorial effect unless the statute expressly so provides (I
                            shall henceforth refer to this as the “presumption against
                            extra-territoriality”). There is no express provision in
                            section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act that provides for extra-territorial
                            effect.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Furthermore, section 19(1)(c), (g) and (h)
                            of the TCM Act contain phrases such as “in any other
                            country” and “in Singapore or elsewhere”,
                            indicating that Parliament expressly intended for these subsections to
                            have extra-territorial effect. The lack of similar phrases in
                            section 19(1)(i) shows that Parliament did not intend for it to
                            have extra-territorial effect.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Predictably, the Respondent made the opposite
                    submission that section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act applied to acts committed
                    by the Appellant outside Singapore. It raised the following arguments in support
                    of this proposition:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act
                            (Cap. 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation Act”) requires the
                            court to interpret a statute in a way that would promote its underlying
                            purpose.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The primary purpose of the Act, as evinced by the
                            record of Parliamentary proceedings relating to the Act, was to regulate
                            the standard of TCM practice in order to ensure the safety and well
                            being of patients in Singapore. This purpose would be frustrated if a
                            TCM practitioner could escape disciplinary action simply by treating his
                            patients in a nearby overseas jurisdiction.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Appellant had treated the Patient in his
                            capacity as a TCM practitioner registered with the Board. Hence, the
                            Board’s power to regulate his activities remains unfettered
                            regardless of where the Appellant chose to treat the
                        Patient.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Courts in other jurisdictions have taken the view
                            that statutes, under which disciplinary tribunals are constituted to
                            investigate instances of professional misconduct, should be interpreted
                            in a way that allows these tribunals to consider misconduct occurring in
                            a foreign jurisdiction.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Many disciplinary tribunals in Singapore have
                            taken into consideration acts committed by a member in a foreign
                            jurisdiction.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The position taken by Ms Koh was similar
                    to that of the Respondent. However, Ms Koh also challenged the very
                    application of the presumption against extra-territoriality to
                    section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act. Her arguments were as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The presumption against extra-territoriality
                            applied only to offence creating statutes. This presumption did not
                            apply to section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act because that section is
                            not an offence creating statute but simply confers upon the Board the
                            disciplinary power to determine whether a person should be permitted to
                            remain as a registered TCM practitioner in Singapore.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Once the presumption against extra-territoriality
                            was out of the picture, it became clear that the purpose of
                            section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act could only be served by allowing
                            the Board to take into consideration acts committed by a registered TCM
                            practitioner in his capacity as such, even if those acts were committed
                            in a foreign jurisdiction.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General comments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Before I proceed with the substantive
                    analysis, I would just make some comments regarding the presumption against
                    extra-territoriality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     My first comment relates to
                    Ms Koh’s submissions that the presumption against
                    extra-territoriality applies only to “offence creating” statutes
                    and that there is no such presumption when the statute in question is not an
                    “offence creating” one. In support of this proposition, she cited
                    the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Pong Tek Yin</em>
                    [1990] 1 SLR(R) 543, where the court held at [16] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is one of construction, and in construing that section it
                        must be borne in mind that there is a well-established presumption that in
                        the absence of clear and specific words to the effect a statute which
                        creates an offence is not intended to make an act taking place outside the
                        territorial jurisdiction of the country an offence triable in the courts
                        here: <em>Air-India v Wiggins</em> [1980] 2 All
                        ER 593.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While Ms Koh’s argument is an
                    attractive one, it may not be easy to determine whether a particular law is an
                    offence creating statute or not. Virtually every law that purports to regulate
                    behaviour provides for a penalty (either a fine or a jail sentence) in the event
                    that it is breached. For example, in <em>Mackinnon v Donaldson
                        Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp</em> [1986] Ch. 482, Hoffman J
                    invoked the presumption against extra-territoriality in refusing to interpret
                    section 7 of the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act 1879 (UK) (c.11), which
                    allowed a court to order the inspection of entries in a banker’s book, as
                    having extra-territorial effect (at 493). Although the said section 7 did
                    not explicitly make a party’s refusal to comply with a court inspection
                    order a criminal offence, such refusal would certainly have been regarded as
                    contempt of court and would have attracted a fine or even a jail sentence. In
                    this sense, every statutory instrument can be regarded as an “offence
                    creating” statute by virtue of the state’s exercise of its coercive
                    power in enforcing it. In this case, section 19 of the TCM Act relies
                    primarily on the Board’s power to cancel a practitioner’s
                    registration to ensure compliance with its rules. At first glance, this may seem
                    to be a “non offence” because the penalty of cancellation of
                    registration is different from traditional criminal penalties like a fine or a
                    jail sentence. However, section 19(2)(b) of the TCM Act also allows the
                    Board to impose a penalty of up to $10,000 in lieu of such deregistration.
                    Although the TCM Act refers to it as a “penalty” and not a fine
                    and section 19(4) provides that this penalty is recoverable “as a
                    debt due to the Board”, it is difficult to see how this penalty differs
                    conceptually from a fine in its effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The definition of an “offence
                    creating’ statute may be narrowed by making references to traditional
                    notions of what constitutes a crime. Yet even this path is fraught with
                    difficulty. As many academics have pointed out, there is no clear definition of
                    what constitutes a crime (e.g. G. Williams, ‘The Definition of
                    Crime’ (1955) <em>Current Legal Problems</em> 107, at
                    130; A. Simester and G. Sullivan, <em>Criminal Law: Theory and
                        Doctrine</em> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 2007), at
                    3-4.)). The concept of crime can be defined in many ways. One way is to define
                    it to mean all activities that are prohibited by the state and which are
                    enforced by penalties imposed directly by it. Another way to define it is by
                    looking at factors such as the type of proceedings that are brought to enforce
                    it, the type of evidence that can be adduced and the burden of proof that is
                    required. In the absence of any consensus as to what exactly is an
                    “offence creating” statute, I shall proceed on the basis that
                    there is a presumption against extra-territoriality in the construction of all
                    statutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, the cases dealing with the
                    presumption against extra-territoriality tend to do so in a way that suggests
                    that there is a strict dichotomy between laws with extra-territorial effect and
                    laws that do not. Of course, reality is more complex than that and it is
                    probably more accurate to speak of degrees of extra-territoriality than to think
                    of extra-territoriality as a discrete category. For example, a law that affects
                    the actions of foreigners in a foreign jurisdiction is clearly more
                    “extra-territorial” than one which only seeks to control the
                    actions of a country’s citizens in a foreign jurisdiction, although both
                    can be regarded as having some form of extra-territorial effect. In so far as
                    the presumption against extra-territoriality is based on a hypothetical
                    legislative concern about the problems that extra-territorial effect may create,
                    the strength of the presumption may vary depending on the extent to which
                    extra-territorial effect is claimed, since a law with lesser extra-territorial
                    effect can be expected to present lesser problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Thirdly, counsel for the Respondent and
                    Ms Koh have cited many cases where the acts of professionals in foreign
                    jurisdictions were taken into consideration in disciplinary proceedings.
                    Strictly speaking, these cases are not of direct relevance to the question of
                    whether section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act should be construed as having
                    extra-territorial effect since they were based on the interpretation of
                    different statutory instruments. However, insofar as the courts had, in these
                    cases, identified the purpose which the statutes were meant to serve and
                    determined that those purposes could only be fulfilled by interpreting the
                    statutes to have some degree of extra-territorial effect, they provide helpful
                    guidance as to the degree of extra-territorial effect that is required to
                    achieve a certain purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purpose, enforceability and comity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 9A of the Interpretation Act
                    requires the court to interpret a written law in a way that would promote the
                    purpose or object underlying the written law. One of the ways to determine the
                    underlying purpose or object of a statute is by looking at the Parliamentary
                    debates. During the second reading of the Traditional Chinese Medicine
                    Practitioners Bill on 14 November 2000 (Singapore Parliament Debates,
                    Official Report (14 November 2000), Volume 72, sitting number 11), the
                    Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Mr Chan Soo Sen,
                    informed Parliament that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In July 1994, the Ministry of Health appointed a Committee to look into
                        the regulation of TCM. The Committee recommended a phased approach, (ie a
                        step by step approach) to the regulation of TCM practitioners in order
                            <b><u>to safeguard patients’ interest and safety,
                            as well as to enhance the standard of training and professionalism of
                            TCM practitioners in Singapore</u></b>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]tatutory regulation of TCM practice is necessary <b><u>to safeguard patients’ interest and safety</u></b>. We have to
                        ensure that TCM practitioners are properly trained and qualified before they
                        are allowed to practise. There should also be a framework to raise the
                        professional standard of TCM practitioners in Singapore…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is clear from the above that the overriding
                    purpose of the TCM Act is to ensure the safety and well being of patients by
                    ensuring a minimum standard of professionalism among the TCM practitioners. The
                    legislative intent of the TCM Act is reinforced by the Ethical Code and Ethical
                    Guidelines for TCMP (January 2006) (“Ethical Code”), which
                    provides at page 5 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This “Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines for TCM
                        Practitioners” represents the fundamental tenets of conduct and
                        behaviour expected of TCM practitioners practising in Singapore, and
                        elaborates on their applications. They are intended as a guide to all TCM
                        practitioners as to what the Board regards as the minimum standards required
                        of all TCM practitioners in the discharge of their professional duties and
                        responsibilities in the practice of TCM in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fairness, the Ethical Code does mention “practising
                        <em>in Singapore</em>” and “the practice
                    of TCM <em>in Singapore</em>”, thus implying that it
                    accepts the presumption against extra-territoriality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Having determined the purpose of the TCM Act,
                    the next step is to select an interpretation of section 19(1)(i) of the TCM
                    Act that would best serve that purpose. In doing this, it is important to
                    remember that the number of ways which a statute can be interpreted depends on
                    the number of factors which the interpreter regards as being legally
                    significant. Hence, if a court finds that a statute ought to be interpreted as
                    having extra-territorial effect in a particular factual situation, it should
                    also highlight the legally significant factors that form the basis for its
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A survey of the cases suggests that there are
                    two main problems associated with interpreting a statute to have
                    extra-territorial effect. The first is the problem of enforceability while the
                    second is that of comity among nations. In <em>Parno v SC Marine
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 377, the Court of Appeal
                    held at [41] that Parliament could not have intended the provisions of the now
                    defunct Factories Act (Cap 104, Rev Ed 1998) to apply to factories abroad
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…enforcement of the Act would be impossible without infringing on
                        the sovereignty of another state, let alone the practical difficulties
                        associated with such enforcement worldwide. The main object of the Act is
                        clearly to protect and ensure the safety of the many workmen who work on
                        industrial premises in Singapore. To hold that the Factories Act is
                        applicable to the case at hand, when there is no doubt that the <em>Sumpile 8</em> was at the material time within the
                        territorial waters of Myanmar, would be to intrude into the jurisdiction of
                        another state.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court in <em>Carson v
                        Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</em> [2002] 3 All E.R. 994
                    explained the rationale behind the presumption against extra-territoriality in
                    terms of enforceability and comity thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The comity of nations is doubtless one basis for this presumption: one
                        state should not be taken to interfere with the sovereignty of another state
                        by enacting legislation extending to its territory. Another is practicality:
                        most legislation cannot practically be applied to those present in another
                        state.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, there are different degrees of extra-territoriality
                    and correspondingly varying degrees of problems with enforcement and comity
                    issues. The question of enforcement is essentially a practical one and depends
                    largely on whether the penalty that is sought to be imposed on the party who has
                    infringed the statute can be done so effectively. Where the party against whom
                    enforcement is sought has substantial links to the domestic jurisdiction (either
                    because he is a citizen of that jurisdiction or has substantial property there),
                    enforcement is more likely to be more successful. Finally, to use an example
                    that is more relevant to the case at hand, where the penalty sought to be
                    imposed involves the cancellation of a licence that allows the infringer to
                    engage in some regulated activity in the domestic jurisdiction, there is
                    certainty of successful enforcement for obvious reasons. This probably explains
                    why many courts in different jurisdictions have been willing to find that
                    disciplinary tribunals are entitled to consider the acts of their members that
                    were committed overseas when determining if disciplinary action should be taken
                    against them. (See <em>Marinovich v General Medical
                        Council</em> [2002] UKPC 36; <em>Re Legault and Law
                        Society of Upper Canada</em> (1975) 58 DLR (3D) 641; <em>Ewachniuk v Law Society (British Columbia)</em> [1998]
                    Carswell BC 358].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Comity is a more controversial concept. Unlike
                    enforceability which is usually a pure question of fact, the idea of comity is
                    affected both by customary international law and legal history. For example, the
                    interpretation of a statute to cover acts committed by a country’s
                    nationals in a foreign jurisdiction is regarded as less harmful to comity than
                    if that statute were interpreted to cover acts committed by foreigners in that
                    foreign jurisdiction. This is so despite the fact that in both situations, the
                    state is seeking to punish an individual for acts committed in a foreign
                    jurisdiction. The reason is probably because historically, law was regarded as
                    personal and it was only until the advent of the territorial state that it
                    became more fixed to the territory over which the state had effective control
                    (Brierley, James L., ‘The Lotus Case’, <em>Law
                        Quarterly Review</em> 44 (1928): 155-156). Furthermore, states do
                    claim some form of jurisdiction over acts committed by their citizens in foreign
                    jurisdictions (see for example, section 8A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap.
                    185, 2008 Rev Ed) and section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap.
                    241, 1993 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Both Ms Koh and counsel for the
                    Respondent have cited the case of <em>Re Wong Sin Yee</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 676 to show that a statute should be interpreted
                    as having extra-territorial effect if doing so would serve its underlying
                    purpose. In that case, the High Court had to determine whether section 30 of the
                    Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap. 67, 2000 Rev Ed)
                    (“CLTPA”), which allows the Home Affairs Minister to detain
                    individuals without trial for up to 12 months, could be used to authorize the
                    detention of a person for criminal activities committed outside Singapore. The
                    detainee relied on the presumption against extra-territoriality to support his
                    case for a narrow interpretation of section 30 of the CLTPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The detainee’s argument was rejected by
                    Tan Lee Meng J who held that section 30 of the CLTPA allowed the Minister
                    to take into consideration activities committed outside Singapore in determining
                    whether the detention order was required in the interests of public safety,
                    peace and good order in Singapore. He stated, at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the Minister must be satisfied that a detention order is required in
                        the interests of public safety, peace and good order in Singapore, it does
                        not follow that the threat to public safety, peace and good order must
                        result from criminal activities in Singapore. Otherwise, a person who is
                        believed to be a threat to public safety, peace and good order in Singapore
                        because of his criminal activities abroad must be given some time to become
                        involved in criminal activities in Singapore before he can be detained under
                        s 30 of the CLTPA. The applicant's first ground for challenging the
                        Detention Order thus fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">No doubt this decision was fully justified because of the obvious
                    purpose of the CLTPA. However, it is worth mentioning that the detainee in that
                    case was a Singaporean, hence the abovementioned problems of enforcement and
                    comity did not feature there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Accordingly, I find that the question of
                    whether a statute should be interpreted as having any degree of
                    extra-territorial effect depends on the extent to which its purpose would be
                    served by such an interpretation and whether this interpretation would result in
                    problems relating to enforcement and international comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Having regard to the fact that the overriding
                    purpose of the TCM act is to ensure the safety and well being of patients by
                    ensuring a minimum standard of professionalism among TCM practitioners, I must
                    now choose an interpretation of section 19(1)(i) that will best achieve
                    this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I accept the Board’s submission that to
                    hold that section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act does not apply in the present
                    case would undermine its underlying purpose. Registered TCM practitioners who
                    wish to perform unauthorized and possibly unsafe treatments on their patients
                    will have a ready mechanism: they can simply cross the Causeway and perform
                    those treatments there with seeming impunity. This is a loophole that cannot be
                    accepted. Accordingly, an interpretation of section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act
                    that covers the facts of the present case would better serve its underlying
                    purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What are the legally significant factors that
                    form the basis of this decision? In this respect, the case of <em>Re Linus Joseph</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 12
                        (“<em>Re Linus Joseph</em>”) provides
                    useful guidance. In that case, the defendant was an advocate and solicitor of
                    both the Singapore bar and the Brunei bar. The defendant had allegedly
                    dishonestly withheld professional fees from his employers, a Brunei firm of
                    advocates and solicitors, whilst in the employment of that firm in Brunei. The
                    issue in that case was whether the Disciplinary Committee could take this
                    alleged misconduct into consideration when determining whether the defendant was
                    guilty of grossly improper conduct under section 80(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1985 Rev
                Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Court held that the words “guilty
                    of fraudulent or grossly improper misconduct in the discharge of his
                    professional duty” under section 80(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Profession Act referred to the discharge of a
                    solicitor’s duty in his capacity as an advocate or solicitor of the
                    Supreme Court of Singapore. Since it was clear that the defendant’s acts
                    had been committed in his capacity as a Brunei solicitor, they did not fall
                    within section 80(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal
                    Profession Act. More significantly, the Court considered that if a solicitor had
                    acted improperly in his capacity as a Singapore solicitor, such conduct would
                    fall under section 80(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal
                    Profession Act notwithstanding that it took place in a foreign
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Court in <em>Re Linus
                        Joseph</em> chose the capacity in which the defendant solicitor acted
                    as the legally significant factor for determining the jurisdictional ambit of
                        section 80(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Profession
                    Act. In my opinion, an interpretation of section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act to
                    cover all sorts of professional misconduct committed by a registered
                    practitioner in his capacity as such, regardless of where those acts were
                    committed, best serves the underlying purpose of the TCM Act and does not result
                    in an overreaching effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This interpretation will not create any
                    substantial problem with enforcement or comity. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>, there is unlikely to be any problem with the
                    enforcement of statutes relating to professional disciplinary bodies regardless
                    of the extent of extra-territorial effect that is claimed because the mode of
                    enforcement (i.e., the cancellation of registration) is one that can be effected
                    easily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Neither will there be comity problems if the
                    basis of the jurisdiction under section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act is linked
                    to the TCM practitioner acting in his capacity as a Singapore registered
                    practitioner. After all, the cancellation of the practitioner’s registered
                    status only prevents him from practising TCM in Singapore. He is still free to
                    practise TCM in other jurisdictions. Hence, the foreign jurisdictions’
                    power to regulate the type of treatments that may be performed within their
                    territory is unaffected. Furthermore, jurisdiction that is linked to the
                    capacity in which the TCM practitioner acts is quite similar to the type of
                    nationality-based jurisdiction mentioned in paragraph <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above. Just as nationality-based jurisdiction is justified
                    on the ground that a citizen who enjoys the protection of his state should
                    accept the restrictions imposed on him, the jurisdiction of
                    section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act extends to a TCM practitioner whenever he
                    conducts himself as a Singapore registered TCM practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According, I find that section 19(1)(i)
                    of the TCM Act extends to a TCM practitioner whenever and wherever he conducts
                    himself as a Singapore registered TCM practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is not disputed that the Appellant had met
                    the patient in his Singapore Rochor Clinic and was treating him in his capacity
                    as a Singapore registered TCM practitioner. Neither is there any doubt that when
                    the Appellant performed the treatment on the patient at the Johor clinic, he was
                    doing so in that same capacity. Accordingly, the Board was right in taking into
                    account these acts when considering whether the Appellant was guilty of a charge
                    under section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Although I have held that
                    section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act applies whenever a person acts in his
                    capacity as a Singapore registered TCM practitioner, this does not necessarily
                    mean that everything he commits outside of his capacity as a Singapore
                    registered TCM practitioner cannot be taken into consideration under another
                    provision of the TCM Act. It bears noting that in <em>Re Linus
                        Joseph</em>, the Court expressly left open the question of whether the
                    defendant’s conduct would have rendered him liable to disciplinary
                    proceedings under a different provision in the Legal Profession Act. Using the
                    same reasoning set out earlier for section 19(1)(i), it may be difficult to
                    argue that section 19(1)(j) of the TCM Act should not be interpreted to
                    include improper acts or conduct committed by a TCM practitioner anywhere
                    outside of his capacity as a Singapore registered TCM
                practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the Board err in finding that the Appellant’s treatment of
                the Patient at the Johor Clinic was against TCM practice and amounted to
                professional misconduct under section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In his second ground of appeal, the Appellant
                    alleged that the Board erred in its decision that the administration of
                    injections and the use of the Machine on the Patient were not established TCM
                    practice. The basis of this allegation is that no expert witnesses were called
                    to ascertain whether or not such practices were established TCM
                practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Established TCM practice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Section 2 of the TCM Act defines
                    “practice of traditional Chinese medicine” as meaning the various
                    acts or activities set out in the definition and “prescribed practice of
                    traditional Chinese medicine” as any type of practice of TCM that has
                    been declared as such prescribed practice by the Minister under
                    section 14(1). The TCM Act does not state that a failure by any TCM
                    practitioner to adhere to established TCM practice amounts to professional
                    misconduct or negligence under section 19(1)(i). According, questions such
                    as whether a particular practice amounts to established TCM practice and whether
                    a failure to adhere to established TCM practice amounts to professional
                    misconduct can only be answered by referring to the particular norms of TCM as
                    well as general legal principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Ethical Code is a helpful starting point
                    for this inquiry. Paragraph (e) at section 4.1.1 of the Ethical Code states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A TCM practitioner shall only <b><u>use appropriate and
                            generally accepted methods of TCM treatment when attending to his
                            patient</u></b>. He shall not use unorthodox TCM treatment or any
                        treatment that may tarnish the reputation of the TCM profession. Where a TCM
                        practitioner has any doubt as to whether any treatment is unorthodox or may
                        tarnish the reputation of the TCM profession, the TCM practitioner shall
                        obtain clarifications from the Board in writing before proceeding with such
                        treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Accordingly, a TCM practitioner’s
                    failure to use appropriate and generally accepted methods of TCM treatment would
                    be a breach of the Ethical Code and may amount to professional misconduct or
                    negligence. In addition, the Ethical Code also suggests that the question
                    whether a particular practice is an established TCM practice depends on whether
                    the treatment is generally accepted as an appropriate treatment for a particular
                    ailment. The purpose of ensuring that TCM practitioners use only established TCM
                    treatments to treat their patients is no doubt to ensure that patients do not
                    suffer the unpredictable effects of unorthodox treatments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Gobinathan Devathasan v
                        Singapore Medical Coucil</em> [2010] SGHC 51 (“<em>Devathasa”</em>), the Court of three Judges had the
                    opportunity to decide how a tribunal should determine whether a particular
                    medical practice was a generally accepted one. It accepted (at [46]) the expert
                    witnesses’ testimony that the following factors were essential:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there had to be at least “one good
                            study”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the results of the study can be replicated and
                            reproduced under the same sort of like treatment parameters and
                            conditions;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the study had been written up in publications and
                            presented at meetings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the study had received peer
                        review;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the study had to have “clear-cut
                            results” and the sample had to be “statistically
                            significant”; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the study had to have some form of controls, such
                            as randomised double-blind trials.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In my opinion, the requirements that have to
                    be satisfied in order for a medical practice to be an accepted one should not be
                    transplanted wholesale to TCM practice. There are distinctions between the
                    medical profession and the TCM profession and it may be unfair to judge them
                    according to a single standard. While medical advances are usually subject to
                    intensive clinical trials and heavily documented in medical journals, TCM
                    practices are often developed through experience and shared through more
                    informal settings. This is not to suggest, of course, that TCM is in any way
                    inferior to general medical treatment. Ultimately, the question whether a
                    particular TCM practice is an established one is a purely factual question and
                    depends substantially on how generally accepted it is among the TCM
                    practitioners in Singapore and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Court in <em>Devathasan</em> also set out how the burden of proof should be
                    discharged where a medical professional was charged with having given treatment
                    that was not generally accepted by the medical profession as a form of clinical
                    treatment. Essentially, the Disciplinary Council bore the burden of showing that
                    the particular practice was not generally accepted by the medical profession as
                    a form of clinical treatment. However, this fact merely created a presumption
                    that the treatment, because of its lack of general acceptance, was not
                    appropriate. The medical professional in question could still defend himself by
                    showing some evidence that the treatment may do some good but will do no harm to
                    the patient. As the Court held at [62]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the charge is for inappropriate treatment because that treatment
                        is not indicated for that condition and not generally accepted by the
                        profession, then the <em>evidential</em> burden is on
                        the defending doctor to prove that safety of the patient is a reason to
                        negative an assumption of inappropriate treatment on the analogy of
                        “off-label” treatment. We are of the opinion that where a
                        doctor embarks on a treatment that is not indicated or generally accepted in
                        the profession, but the doctor is of the view that his novel treatment may
                        do some good, but will do no harm to the patient, placing such a burden on
                        him to establish that no harm will come to that patient strikes a correct
                        balance between two important considerations in medicine, <em>viz</em>, promoting innovation and progress, provided that the
                        patient’s well-being is not compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Court’s approach in <em>Devathasan</em> strikes a proper balance between the
                    promotion of scientific progress in medicine and the protection of the
                    patient’s well being. This approach should also be used in determining
                    whether a particular TCM practice is an appropriate and generally accepted
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The injections</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Board found that the Appellant had
                    administered injections on the Patient on multiple occasions. This finding of
                    fact was based on witness testimony from the family members of the Patient to
                    the effect that they saw the Appellant inject clear and red fluids into the
                    Patient’s body. The fact that large amounts of syringes and needles were
                    discovered at the Appellant’s Rochor Clinic during a joint inspection by
                    the Board and HSA also provided strong circumstantial evidence that the
                    Appellant had the practice of administering injections on his patients. The
                    Appellant’s attempts to explain the presence of these needles and syringes
                    in his Rochor Clinic were not credible and were unsupported by any evidence. In
                    the light of this, I could see no reason to disagree with the Board’s
                    finding of fact that the Appellant did administer injections on the
                    Patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There is no doubt that the Appellant’s
                    administration of injections was contrary to established TCM practice. Indeed,
                    as Counsel for the Board correctly pointed out, the Appellant himself had
                    admitted in his Affidavit of Evidence In Chief (“AEIC”) that TCM
                    practitioners were not allowed to administer injections on patients. The
                    Appellant stated at paragraph 97 of his AEIC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am a qualified TCM practitioner and was in the first batch of accredited
                        acupuncturists and TCM physicians in Singapore. I am aware of what falls
                        within the scope of my role as a TCM practitioner and am fully aware that I
                        am not trained to administer injections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Having regard to the Appellant’s own
                    admission that he was not trained to administer injections, there was no need
                    for the Board to call expert witnesses to testify on this issue. Accordingly,
                    the Board was fully justified in finding that the Appellant’s acts of
                    administering injections on the Patient amounted to a breach of the Ethical Code
                    and constituted professional misconduct under section 19(1)(i) of the TCM
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The use of Machine on the Patient</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     With respect to the Appellant’s use of
                    the Machine on the Patient to cure or alleviate his rectum cancer, IC 2005/1
                    found that this treatment was not in accordance with established TCM practice.
                    The Appellant’s argument that IC 2005/1 should not have come to this
                    conclusion without the aid of expert evidence is not correct. It is well
                    established that expert evidence is only required if the tribunal is unable to
                    come to its conclusion without the aid of specialized knowledge. In <em>Chou Kooi Pang and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 3
                    SLR(R), the Court of Appeal held at [16]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is well established that <b><u>expert opinion is only
                            admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is
                            likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge</u></b>.
                        If, on the proven facts, a judge can form his own conclusions without help,
                        the opinion of an expert is unnecessary: <em>Regina v Turner
                            (Terence)</em> [1975] QB 834. Thus, a psychiatrist's
                        evidence was held inadmissible where its purpose was, in effect, to tell a
                        jury how an ordinary person, not suffering from any mental illness, was
                        likely to react to the strains and stresses of life: <em>R v
                            Weightman</em> (1991) 92 Cr App R 291. In <em>R v Masih</em> [1986] Crim LR 395, the court
                        expressed the view that in the case of an IQ which, though low, was within
                        the range of normality as understood by psychologists, the adducing of
                        expert evidence was not justified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In this case, most of the members of the
                    investigation committee in IC 2005/1 were experienced TCM practitioners.
                    Mr Ng Cheong Kim, the Chairman of the tribunal, and Mr Ang Liang, a
                    member, had 31 years of practice experience each. Two other members,
                    Mr Chew Wee Heong and Ms Tan Siew Buoy, had 29 and 28 years of
                    practice experience respectively. The fifth member was not a TCM practitioner.
                    The 4 TCM practitioner members were undoubtedly experts in TCM practice. I
                    therefore doubt the utility of having an experienced TCM practitioner testify to
                    something which was already well within the experience and knowledge of four out
                    of five members of IC 2005/1. Under these circumstances, IC 2005/1 was clearly
                    justified in reaching the conclusion that the Appellant’s use of the
                    Machine on the Patient was not in accordance with established TCM
                    practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Under the principles propounded in <em>Devathasan</em>, the Appellant could still have justified his
                    use of the Machine on the Patient by providing some evidence to show that such
                    treatment may do some good but will do no harm to the patient. Unfortunately,
                    the objective evidence suggested that the Appellant himself had no idea what
                    exactly the Machine could do for the patient. In fact, he could not even say
                    that the use of the Machine on the Patient would not do any harm to him. During
                    the inquiry, the Appellant admitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The machine is new. I don’t know the effectiveness of this machine.
                        The main feature is the needle when it is pierced in the tumour, it
                        won’t burn but it will be like a fire needle to burn the tumour away.
                        So it would improve his cancer symptoms and prolong his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When asked by IC 2005/1 whether he was aware of the consequences of
                    using the Machine, the Appellant answered that he had only seen and heard of the
                    Machine and was not sure of the consequences of using it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is therefore clear that the use of the
                    Machine was not established TCM practice and the Appellant’s use of the
                    Machine on the Patient was against established TCM practice and amounted to an
                    act of professional misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Board’s decision to cancel the Appellant’s
                registration as a TCM practitioner is manifestly excessive punishment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     An appellate court that hears an appeal from
                    the decision of a disciplinary committee should afford a measure of deference to
                    it. As Lord Hailsham stated in <em>Julius Libman v General
                        Medical Council</em> [1972] AC 217 at 221, a finding or
                    order of the disciplinary committee should be not displaced:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... unless it can be shown that something was clearly wrong either (i) in
                        the conduct of the trial or (ii) in the legal principles applied or (iii)
                            <em>unless it can be shown that the findings of the
                            committee were sufficiently out of tune with the evidence to indicate
                            with reasonable certainty that the evidence had been
                        misread</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The reason for this deference lies in the fact
                    that the disciplinary committee has specialized knowledge of the seriousness of
                    the particular act of misconduct and is better placed than the appellate court
                    in determining what kind of measure is required to deal with it. Hence, Lord
                    Millet held in <em>Ghosh v General Medical Council</em>
                    [2001] 1 WLR 1915 at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Evans v General Medical
                            Council</em> (unreported) 19 November 1984 the Board [of the
                        Privy Council] said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The principles upon which this Board acts in reviewing sentences
                            passed by the Professional Conduct Committee are well settled. It has
                            been said time and again that a disciplinary committee are the best
                            possible people for weighing the seriousness of professional misconduct,
                            and that the Board will be very slow to interfere with the exercise of
                            the discretion of such a committee ... The committee are familiar with
                            the whole gradation of seriousness of the cases of various types which
                            come before them, and are peculiarly well qualified to say at what point
                            on that gradation erasure becomes the appropriate sentence. This Board
                            does not have that advantage nor can it have the same capacity for
                            judging what measures are from time to time required for the purpose of
                            maintaining professional standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     These principles have been adopted by our
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Low Cze Hong v Singapore Medical
                        Council</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 (“<em>Low Cze Hong</em>”) at [40] to [43]. The present
                    approach of the court is to give a measure of deference to the decisions reached
                    by a disciplinary committee but not in a way that will effectively render
                    nugatory the appellate powers granted to the court under respective statutes. In
                        <em>Low Cze Hong</em>, the Court of Appeal indicated
                    that it would adopt the approach stated by Lord Phillips in Council for
                        th<em>e Regulation of Health Care Professionals v General
                        Medical Council and Ruscillo</em> [2005] 1 WLR 717 (at
                    [78]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where all material evidence has been placed before the disciplinary
                        tribunal and it has given due consideration to the relevant factors, the
                        council and the court should place weight on the expertise brought to bear
                        in evaluating how best the needs of the public and the profession should be
                        protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     When the appeal from the Disciplinary
                    Committee’s decision concerns an issue of sentencing, the appellate court
                    is unlikely to overturn the sentence unless there has been a misapprehension of
                    facts, a misdirection of facts or if the sentence is out of line with other
                    precedents dealing with acts of misconduct that are of equivalent severity:
                        <em>Tan Sek Ho</em> v <em>Singapore

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the present case, IC 2005/1’s
                    recommendation to cancel the Appellant’s registration as a TCM
                    practitioner was based on the three complaints against him as stated at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above. While the Appellant’s
                    prescription of medicines that were not TCM medicines (under the second
                    complaint) as well as his failure to keep proper records of his patients (under
                    the third complaint) were serious, these acts might not have warranted a
                    cancellation of his registration as a TCM practitioner. However, the
                    Appellant’s conduct in respect of the first complaint was extremely
                    serious because it reflected a disregard of the Patient’s safety, as well
                    as a deliberate intent to flout the Ethical Code. The Appellant’s
                    administration of injections on the Patient was prohibited and could have caused
                    serious consequences for the Patient. The Appellant’s use of the Machine
                    on the Patient also caused severe pain and there was simply no evidence that
                    this treatment had any beneficial effect on the Patient at all despite the
                    Appellant’s claim that it had prolonged the Patient’s life. These
                    two acts amounted to a high degree of professional misconduct under
                    section 19(1)(i) of the TCM Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In these circumstances, I am unable to say
                    that IC 2005/1 and the Board erred when they came to the conclusion that the
                    cancellation of the Appellant’s registration was the appropriate sanction
                    on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal with
                    costs. By virtue of section 19(5) of the TCM Act, the cancellation of the
                    Appellant’s registration took effect from the date of my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I would like to record my deep appreciation
                    for the efforts put in by all counsel involved in contacting other professional
                    disciplinary bodies to enquire about their experience concerning the issue of
                    extra-territoriality and for their immense assistance in presenting the
                    arguments in a clear and fair manner. I thank Ms Koh especially for having
                    agreed to assist in this appeal at short notice and for her clear and crisp
                    thoughts on the issue assigned to her as <em>amicus
                        curiae</em>. I also thank the following professional bodies for
                    providing the information sought:</p>
