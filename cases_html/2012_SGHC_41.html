<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The first plaintiff, Breezeway Overseas Ltd
                        (“<b>Breezeway</b>”), is a customer of
                    the first defendant, UBS AG (“<b>UBS</b>”).
                    Breezeway is a family investment vehicle controlled by the second plaintiff,
                    Vasanmal Murli, who is one of its directors; the other directors are his wife
                    and two daughters. Breezeway held accounts with the Hong Kong and Singapore
                    branches of UBS, ie the fourth and fifth defendants respectively. At the
                    material time, Breezeway was initially serviced by the second and then the third
                    defendants, who were his client advisers and employees of the Singapore branch,
                    ie fifth defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">History of summons application and order for discovery in
                stages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present summons was taken out by the
                    plaintiffs for discovery to be carried out in accordance with a proposed
                    electronic discovery protocol. The second and third defendant had, by the time
                    the summons came up for hearing, left the employment of UBS. They had also
                    deposed to the fact that they did not have in their possession, custody or power
                    any discoverable documents – all discoverable documents had been turned
                    over to UBS when their employment with UBS came to an end. As UBS was not
                    familiar with how these documents had been organised, the use of search terms to
                    identify discoverable documents would be conducive to the efficient management
                    of discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After hearing submissions from counsel, I had
                    ordered that parties adopt an electronic discovery protocol that provided for
                    discovery to be carried out in stages and for the use of search terms. Parties
                    were directed to discuss and agree on the search terms and liberty to apply was
                    granted for parties to apply to court for determination of any disputed search
                    term. Eventually, parties came back before me for determination of disputed
                    search terms. UBS has now appealed against my decision in relation to the search
                    terms that had been ordered. I set out the reasons for my decision in these
                    grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The <em>raison d’être</em> for discovery
                in stages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In olden days, there was better discipline in
                    maintaining a more or less complete set of documents in a single file. The paper
                    file would usually be kept by the department concerned with the transactions in
                    question or sometimes centrally. Duplicates of certain documents were maintained
                    by other departments: for example, by the finance or accounts department as part
                    of their payment records. Employees usually were not expected to maintain their
                    personal files; and their working papers, unless incorporated into the
                    departmental file on the matter, were usually discarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In more recent times, e-mail messages have taken
                    over the functions of printed correspondence to a large extent. This has
                    resulted in two phenomena – first, the proliferation of copies and second,
                    the decentralisation of records. Electronic mail is personal in the sense that
                    each employee has his own e-mail account. The ease of inserting multiple
                    addressees in an e-mail makes it easy to send the same message to a number of
                    persons. Documents are also thus sent to multiple recipients as attachments to
                    the e-mail message. As a result, the same message appears in each
                    recipient’s e-mail account; and the same documents may be stored on each
                    recipient’s computer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Concomitantly, the practice of maintaining a
                    central file of paper documents that is also a complete record became a practice
                    that was no longer assiduously observed in many organisations. Although document
                    management systems are available that enable an organisation to maintain a
                    central electronic record of documents and e-mails, not many organisations have
                    implemented these systems. Consequently, it is now much more difficult for an
                    organisation like UBS to be able to “pull out the relevant file”.
                    It has to look for documents in the e-mail accounts and computers of all
                    employees involved in the matter. The problem is compounded where, like in the
                    present case, the employees who were most actively involved in the matter are no
                    longer in their employ. Without a centralised document management system, it has
                    to potentially look for discoverable documents in the e-mail accounts and
                    computers of all the employees who had anything to do with Breezeway’s
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This poses a challenge to the application of
                    traditional discovery principles to modern civil litigation. The old rules
                    worked well when all one had to do was to “pull out the relevant
                    file” and identify documents relevant to the issues in dispute. The
                    relevant file was centralised and the problem of duplicates not so severe. In
                    the modern office, the relevant file translates to the e-mail account, the
                    computer hard disk and (frequently) the network storage of each employee. The
                    oftentimes indiscriminate copying of e-mails to multiple addressees will assure
                    that the party giving discovery will have to expend time and resources in
                    identifying and removing duplicates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Although there are computer programs that will
                    be able to identify duplicates – ie de-duplication software – these
                    work only on electronic documents. The effort of identifying and removing
                    duplicates, particularly when documents from multiple custodians and
                    repositories have been collated, should not be underestimated. There is a more
                    efficient and cost-effective way to manage discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">How discovery may be conducted in stages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Conducting discovery in stages requires that
                    parties identify at the close of pleadings both the issues in dispute and the
                    witnesses that are key to these disputed issues. For the purpose of electronic
                    discovery, these witnesses are referred to as custodians: an emphasis on their
                    role as custodians of both knowledge of the relevant facts as well as custodians
                    of the relevant documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Once the key custodians are identified,
                    attention is turned to the repositories of electronic documents in their
                    possession, custody or power. The repositories will typically include their
                    e-mail accounts, hard disks on their desktop and notebook computers, removable
                    storage media, online storage locations on the network, etc. Again, it is not
                    necessarily the case that every repository under the possession, custody or
                    power of each custodian has to be within the scope of the initial stage of
                    discovery. Much depends on the amounts at stake and the significance of the
                    issues in dispute: ie proportionality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Having identified the custodian and the
                    repositories, it is open to parties to either identify the relevant storage
                    media or folders within storage devices (eg hard disks) to be disclosed or
                    parties can agree that a reasonable search be conducted on the identified
                    repositories. Where the custodian has been assiduous in his electronic filing,
                    he may have organised his e-mails and documents into structured folders, much
                    like how paper files used to be kept. In such felicitous circumstances, it will
                    in fact be possible to “pull out the relevant file” by producing a
                    copy of the relevant electronic folders and their content. This will be almost
                    like traditional discovery. The party giving discovery may review the identified
                    electronic folders for irrelevant e-mails and documents before making a copy of
                    the relevant electronic documents for his adversary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Oftentimes, e-mails and electronic documents
                    are not so neatly organised and a keyword search may need to be conducted to
                    identify documents for discovery. In the parlance of our practice directions on
                    electronic discovery, this is a “reasonable search” – an
                    electronic search conducted on the repositories using a set of agreed search
                    terms with reasonable limits: <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata
                        (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd</em> [2011] SGHC 61,
                        at [22]. The search is
                    delimited in two respects.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, parties have to decide
                        whether the entire storage device (eg hard disk) or storage medium is to be
                        searched, or only certain folders and sub-folders. For hard disks, parties
                        should usually identify the relevant folders and sub-folders as modern
                        operating systems usually establish a set of folders where documents are
                        stored. This will obviate the necessity of searching a multitude of folders
                        where operating system, application software, library and configuration
                        files are stored.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, parties have to agree on the time period during which the
                        relevant documents were created or received. This will serve to exclude
                        documents responsive to the search term but which are likely to be
                        irrelevant. The time period may differ for different key words, repositories
                        or custodians.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The search results are presumed to be relevant
                    without the need for a further review of each document for relevance: <em>Sanae Achar v Sci-Gen Ltd</em> [2011] 3 SLR 967;
                    [2011] SGHC 87, at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Conducting discovery in stages will ameliorate
                    the effects of the proliferation of copies and decentralisation of records. By
                    focusing on the key custodians, the party giving discovery need not (at least
                    initially) go beyond those persons who are likely also to be the key witnesses
                    of fact at trial. As has been observed in <em>Goodale &amp; Ors v
                        The Ministry of Justice &amp; Ors</em> [2009] EWHC B41 (QB),
                        at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In terms of a search one should always start with the most important
                        people at the top of the pyramid, that is, adopt a staged or incremental
                        approach. Very often an opposing party will get everything they want from
                        that without having to go down the pyramid any further, often into duplicate
                        material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It must be stressed that in conducting
                    discovery in stages, it is open to parties to proceed with a subsequent stage
                    involving other custodians and repositories after the conclusion of the initial
                    stage. Subsequent stages will be conducted in the same manner as the initial
                    stage: identification of additional custodians and repositories, drawing up
                    search terms and agreeing on the limits for reasonable searches, etc. In the
                    limited experience of this court, a subsequent stage has not been necessary in
                    any case thus far. However, that is very different from saying that subsequent
                    stages will never be necessary. In any event, parties may always make an
                    application for specific discovery under O 24, r 5 based on documents
                    disclosed in the initial stage of discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The order for the initial stage of discovery </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     An order for discovery in stages has to be
                    tailored to the facts of each case, the issues in dispute and the custodians
                    involved. Crucially, the extent of the order must be proportionate to the
                    amounts at stake and the significance of the issues in dispute. Ultimately, the
                    order is calculated to enable the cost-effective management of the discovery
                    stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, the following custodians

                    online in UBS’s servers. This being general discovery, I did not think
                    that any of the issues between parties warranted the restoration and searching
                    of backup tapes. Hence, I ordered that the reasonable search be conducted on the
                    current personal network profiles of employees still under the employ of UBS;
                    and for ex-employees, UBS need only restore the personal network profile as at
                    the last date of his employment or the last date of the relevant period,
                    whichever was earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Based on the issues that were raised during
                    submissions, I also ordered that the reasonable search be further limited to the
                    following periods for the respective custodians:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>February and
                            August 2008.</b> This was the period when Breezeway alleged that
                        misrepresentations were made resulting in its decision to purchase the
                        leveraged bonds. A reasonable search limited to this period was ordered to
                        be conducted on the repositories of Susan Abraham, Anandraj Jain, Kurt
                        Kumschick and Vikrant Kanyal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>February and June 2009.</b>
                        This was the period when Breezeway alleged that inaccurate information was
                        provided leading to its decision to liquidate the leveraged bonds, which in
                        turn led to UBS reassessing the value of Breezeway’s collateral and
                        making a margin call. A reasonable search limited to this period was ordered
                        to be conducted on the repositories of all identified
                    custodians.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As parties had not discussed the search terms
                    to be used in the reasonable search, an adjournment was granted for parties to
                    discuss and agree on a set of search terms to be used, with liberty to apply for
                    a determination in the event of disputes over the search terms to be used. I
                    further directed that parties perform a preliminary search using the disputed
                    keywords before applying for a determination on the disputed search
                    terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Apart from the order for discovery to be
                    conducted in stages and the use of reasonable searches set out above, I made
                    several other orders for specific discovery and interrogatories. As these are
                    not relevant to the subject matter of the Registrar’s Appeal, I need not
                    set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Disputes over search terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Parties were, unfortunately, unable to agree
                    on the list of search terms to be used for the reasonable search. Good faith
                    attempts led to an agreement of 7 search terms, but parties were unable to agree
                    on the remaining 23. Having conducted a preliminary search, parties came back
                    before me for determination of the search terms to be used. After hearing
                    submissions, I allowed a further 10 search terms. I set out hereunder the
                    approach that I had adopted in selecting the search terms to be used and my
                    reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Approach in selecting search terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Search terms function as a proxy for ocular
                    review of electronic documents by identifying documents based on keywords and
                    search operators. The use of keywords and search operators has become almost
                    second nature when we look for material on the Internet. With desktop search
                    engines becoming standard features on modern desktop operating systems, this is
                    fast becoming the natural way for many individuals to look for documents and
                    e-mails stored on their desktop or notebook computers. Modern search engine
                    technology is relied upon to manage the increasingly overwhelming volume of
                    information that is amassed on personal computing devices and to ameliorate the
                    effects brought about by lackadaisical habits in managing and categorising
                    electronically stored documents and e-mails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As has been observed earlier, electronic
                    documents, if assiduously categorised and stored, can be retrieved efficiently.
                    The decentralisation of records without the concomitant discipline of records
                    management leads to the common situation where electronic documents are not
                    properly categorised in the storage medium, thereby making it difficult for
                    orderly retrieval. The problem is compounded where, like the present case, the
                    employees are no longer with UBS and UBS has to discharge its discovery
                    obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As a proxy for ocular review, selection of
                    keywords and search operators has to be made with reference to the pleadings and
                    the issues in dispute; in other words, they must be relevant: <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd</em>. The
                    selection must be made having in mind the ultimate goal: the identification of
                    relevant documents. In selecting keywords and formulating search terms, we ought
                    to guard against the tendency to cast as wide a net as we can in order to obtain
                    the highest number of documents in the search results. This has emerged as a
                    pattern of behaviour in certain types of cases, where the party seeking
                    discovery tries to use searches to draw out as many documents as possible from
                    his adversary, with the hope that he may find the proverbial smoking gun. That
                    would, to my mind, be tantamount to trawling or the emptying out of the
                    adversary’s filing cabinets while hiding behind the mask of search
                    terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As an aside, if a party makes use of search
                    terms to identify documents which he then puts through a process of review in
                    order to identify discoverable document as a means of discharging his discovery
                    obligations, the situation is a little different. As he is not imposing this on
                    his adversary, he can choose to manage the discovery of his own documents in any
                    manner he deems necessary. However, there may potentially be the question
                    whether, if he had adopted a patently inefficient and resource-intensive method
                    of managing discovery, the entire costs of the discovery effort ought to be
                    recoverable as part of party-and-party costs. This is an issue which may need to
                    be addressed at some point in the future when the appropriate case comes up for
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The proper approach in crafting search terms
                    is to have firmly in mind the effects of decentralisation of records without the
                    concomitant discipline of proper records management. Search terms are, on this
                    view, a means of re-establishing a system of categorisation of electronic
                    documents and e-mails. Of course, this is not the only purpose. Search terms can
                    legitimately be used to identify documents based on new parameters that would
                    not have been possible with traditional filing or paper record-keeping
                    practices. It would be wrong to eschew these new options offered by search
                    technology to the discovery process. These may be adopted if they facilitate the
                    ultimate goal of efficient management of the discovery process in a manner
                    proportionate to the amounts at stake and the significance of the issues in
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision relating to the disputed search terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This is the approach which I think ought to be
                    adopted in determining the relevance of keywords and the formulation of search
                    terms. <em>First</em>, commence with the specific before
                    expansion to broader search terms. Specific search terms would include the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>Unique reference
                            numbers.</b> For example, bank account numbers or client account
                        numbers where the context is in a banking relationship. In the context of
                        other commercial transactions, if one party has in place a file reference
                        number or account identification number, these may be used as well. This
                        very closely approximates the traditional paper filing
                    system.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>Names of specific projects.</b> This can be an important
                        keyword particularly where the dispute arises from a developmental project
                        or commercial transaction which has been assigned a project name, eg
                            <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte
                            Ltd</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <b>Keywords which identify the key witnesses (or
                            custodians).</b> For example, e-mail addresses, contact numbers
                        and names or initials. Search terms may be formulated based on such
                        keywords. For example, e-mail addresses of two key witnesses appearing in
                        the same e-mail in order to identify e-mail conversations between them, eg
                            <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte
                            Ltd</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <b>Significant events and locations.</b>
                        Depending on the facts, there may have been a significant meeting which took
                        place. It has proven useful in some cases to make use of the meeting
                        location or a short-hand reference to a key meeting as a search term. This
                        may identify correspondence and documents that have been generated
                        surrounding the event. However, care must be taken in selection of
                        locations. In the present case, there were some meetings which took place at
                        the offices of UBS. The search term “Suntec meeting” did not
                        turn up any hits in the preliminary search. Using “Suntec”
                        alone would have turned up too many, as the standard e-mail footer from
                        employees of UBS contains their office address, which is located in Suntec.
                        However, locations have been useful as a keyword for some other cases, eg
                        meeting at the lobby of Furama hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     
          <em>Next</em>, we can
                    consider search terms incorporating keywords which are unique to the facts of
                    the case or the context of the dispute. The capabilities of the search engine
                    – viz the search operators available – to be used are particularly
                    important for this stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>Product
                            names.</b> Where the dispute centres around the purchase of
                        certain product, the product may be used. However, one should bear in mind
                        the facts of the case. Product names alone would, for example, be unsuitable
                        if the product is one commonly sold by one of the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>Unique phrases.</b> For some industries, there may be
                        unique terms or phrases that can be used to identify significant
                        correspondence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As has been observed elsewhere, we should
                    avoid words which are commonly used, either in daily usage or in the context of
                    the industry: see <em>Robin Duane Littau v Astrata (Asia Pacific)
                        Pte Ltd</em>. Additionally, words which are legal concepts that may be
                    part of the lawyers’ vocabulary and thought process may not always be
                    helpful as keywords, eg breach of contract, confidential, etc. If such keywords
                    are to be used, the search term will have to be carefully crafted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The choice of keywords and formulation of
                    search terms depends on the facts of each case and the issues in dispute. The
                    guidelines and approach set out above provides a means to navigate these waters,
                    but cannot be in any way considered definitive or exhaustive. Further,
                    familiarity with the capabilities of the search engine to be used will in almost
                    all cases be particularly helpful. This will assist the court in formulating
                    search terms which could include keywords which are common words, as in this
                    case (see below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Applying this approach to the keywords which
                    were placed before me, I had permitted an additional 10 search terms. The
                    reasons for permitting them are set out below. First, it ought to be noted that
                    parties had agreed to the use of 7 keywords which fall within the categories of
                    unique reference numbers (ie bank account numbers) and keywords which identify
                    key witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I had permitted keywords based on financial
                    products, ie leveraged bonds, which Breezeway had purchased. These may be
                    further categorised into two baskets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     Products which were fairly unique to
                        the banker-customer relationship between UBS and Breezeway. These were
                        leveraged bonds which had been recommended to Breezeway by the client
                        advisers:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">“Kuznetski” and “Bank of
                                Moscow” – these refer to 2 leveraged bonds which are in
                                dispute, the “7.335% Kuznetski Loan Participation Lot 1 Notes
                                2006 (Bank of Moscow Reg S)” and “7.335% Kuznetski
                                Loan Participation Lot 2 Notes 2006 (Bank of Moscow Reg
                                S)”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">“Kaupthing” – refers to
                                one of the leveraged bonds in dispute; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">“Republic of Venezuela”
                                – similarly refers to one of the leveraged bonds in
                                dispute.</div>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     These keywords
                        were permitted to be run on the repositories and for the periods previously
                        ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
                        were 2 other leveraged bonds – “ICICI” and
                        “VTB” – which were heavily traded by the India desk and
                        which had been recommended to Breezeway. For these, I allowed them but with
                        restrictions. Based on the number of preliminary hits, these were restricted
                        to the e-mail mailboxes of Susan Abraham and Vikrant Kanyal (including the
                        e-mail archive), but not the documents stored on their personal network
                        profile stored online in UBS’s servers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     One of the issues in dispute is whether the
                    loans which Breezeway had taken were secured against collateral, and if so,
                    whether there was any identification of which banking assets had been marked as
                    collateral against the loans. There are also disputes of fact in relation to
                    requests by UBS for additional collateral or margin call. Hence, I had also
                    permitted the keyword “collateral” but restricted to their e-mail
                    mailboxes (including the e-mail archive), having in mind the number of hits in
                    the preliminary search.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Another of the issues in dispute is whether
                    the terms and interest rates of the loans taken by Breezeway was “fixed
                    to maturity”. This is a major issue in dispute as Breezeway’s case
                    is that they were advised to take these loans in order to purchase the bonds on
                    a leveraged basis. In so doing, Vasanmal Murli had insisted that the terms and
                    interest rates of the loans were fixed to maturity. Hence, I allowed the search
                    term using a proximity search of “fixed” within 10 words of
                    “maturity”. For this same reason, I also allowed the search term
                    “fixed loan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I further allowed the keyword
                    “protest”. Although “protest” is a common word, its
                    use in the context of the correspondence between Breezeway and UBS is
                    particularly relevant to one key issue: UBS’s alleged unilateral decision
                    to reduce the “loanable value” of the leveraged bonds which was in
                    turn used by UBS as a basis for the margin call. Breezeway had protested to UBS
                    against this reduction and margin call. In this context, the keyword
                    “protest” was relevant; and the preliminary search did not reveal
                    a surfeit of hits. Hence, the keyword was allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review for privilege and provision of copies <em>in
                    lieu</em> of inspection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Although the search results are deemed to be
                    relevant and no further review for relevance is necessary, time was allocated
                    for UBS to conduct a review for documents and e-mails in the search results
                    which may potentially be privileged or for which there may be good reasons to
                    prevent disclosure, eg documents subject to banking secrecy and which clearly
                    relate only to accounts of the bank’s other customers. In this privilege
                    review process, search terms can also be used effectively in order to identify
                    privileged or confidential information. For example, using the e-mail address of
                    external counsel to identify privileged documents; or account numbers of other
                    customers of the bank handled by the client advisers in order to identify
                    documents which relate to these other customers. Once identified, these
                    documents may either be excluded from the search result or a redacted copy
                    disclosed instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The list of documents serves the role of
                    identifying documents which are disclosed and (for the party entitled to
                    inspection) a means of identifying documents for inspection (and the supply of
                    copies). Any subsequent dispute over disclosure may be settled by reference to
                    the list of documents. When soft copies of electronically stored documents are
                    provided in their native format on finalised optical discs, the list of
                    documents is effectively supplanted by the optical disc. The optical disc
                    functions both as the carrier of copies and also a (directory) listing of
                    documents so supplied. Furthermore, since the optical disc is finalised and no
                    new files may be added (and similarly, no existing file removed), the risk of
                    tampering is significantly reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Hence, I ordered that after UBS has completed
                    its privilege review, discovery was to take place by the provision of softcopies
                    of documents and e-mails in their native formats on a finalised optical disc.
                    E-mails from the Outlook e-mail system can be provided in native PST files. I
                    further directed that parties be dispensed from enumerating each electronic
                    document in the list of documents as individual items. Instead, parties were to
                    categorise and organise the documents and e-mails into folders and sub-folders
                    in the optical disc. The optical disc is to be identified as a single item in
                    the list of documents and its contents given brief descriptions, preferably in
                    accordance to the categorisation in its folders. This conflates the
                    traditionally separate steps of disclosure and supply of copies, and should
                    result in significant savings in time and costs that would otherwise have to be
                    expended for the preparation of the list of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Discovery of electronically stored documents
                    would therefore take place by the provision of the optical disc together with
                    the abbreviated list of documents. For paper documents, the traditional practice
                    of individual enumeration was to be observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally, electronic copies are near perfect
                    duplicates of the original electronic document, particularly where the copy is
                    in native format with metadata intact. The need for inspection of the digital
                    original would usually be unnecessary. Hence, it is appropriate that a different
                    regime be adopted: one based on a <em>request</em> for
                    inspection as opposed to the traditional regime in general discovery where the
                    notice in the list of document makes an <em>offer</em> for
                    inspection (see O 24, r 9). For soft copy documents, inspection was
                    therefore ordered to be deferred and O 24, r 10 was ordered to apply
                    to the list of documents as it applies to pleadings and affidavits. Further, the
                    time for objections under O 27 was ordered to run from the date of exchange
                    of the optical disc or the date of actual inspection, whichever is the
                    later.</p>
