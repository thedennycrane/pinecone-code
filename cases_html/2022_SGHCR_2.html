On 31 October 2021, the Defendant’s solicitors requested softcopies of the documents within the various categories listed in P4SLOD. On 1 November 2021, the Plaintiff’s solicitors informed the Defendant’s solicitors that the Plaintiff was compiling the softcopies and that the originals were located overseas (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“HKSAR”)). On 3 November 2021, the Defendant’s solicitors highlighted to the Plaintiff’s solicitors that (a) the Plaintiff failed to sufficiently enumerate documents in P4SLOD; (b) the Plaintiff failed to produce softcopies of the documents ostensibly listed in P4SLOD; and (c) the Defendant wished to inspect originals of the documents. On 5 November 2021, the Defendant’s solicitors reiterated the Defendant’s positions on the issues above, but there was no response from the Plaintiff’s solicitors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 8 November 2021, six working days after the 28 October 2021 deadline, the Plaintiff’s solicitors provided softcopies of the documents to the Defendant’s solicitors. These softcopy documents were organised in folders, with each document bearing a detailed filename (see a simplified representative schematic in the appended table). According to the Plaintiff, the additional six working days were required to organise the documents in this manner, “to enable the Defendant to clearly see what documents were being disclosed”.

Defendant’s counsel disagreed, arguing that the various categories listed in P4SLOD were not reasonably understood as “bundles of documents” for the purposes of the rule. Both sets of counsel relied solely on <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement v Ho Chin Nguang </span>[2010] 3 SLR 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement</span>”) as the relevant case authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement</span>, the relevant accounts for each period were compiled in a loose-leaf manner and bound in a booklet, with the contents for each relevant period relating to financial transactions including receipts, invoices and payment particulars. The party giving discovery listed the items as shown in the following table: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">101.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">July 2007</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Accounts for the month of July 2007 (159 pages)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Original</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">102.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">September-October 2007</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Accounts for the month of September to October 2007 (191 pages)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Original</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">103.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">November 2007</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Accounts for the month of November 2007 (276 pages)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Original</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The party seeking discovery contended that a further and better list of documents ought to be provided because, in contravention of O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court, the bundles did not contain documents of the same nature and the descriptions of the bundles were insufficient for the documents to be identified. The party seeking discovery sought an order for the party giving discovery to further elaborate upon the listed items by listing every invoice and receipt in each period’s account book. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The court noted that enumerating and describing <span class="font-italic">bundles</span> of documents was an exception to the usual practice of listing <span class="font-italic">individual</span> documents (<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement </span>at [7]). On the facts of the case, the court observed that the account books were originals of the accounts for the relevant periods and, “as would be expected”, contained a compilation of all receipts and invoices constituting the accounts (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [12]). The court rejected the submission that receipts and invoices were “necessarily diverse documents (though dealing with the same subject-matter or transactions) that do not come within the exception” (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>; and see [17(c)] below). The court concluded that the enumeration and description of the three bundles constituted accurate and adequate descriptions of the contents and periods of the items in question, and therefore sufficiently complied with O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I explore in greater detail the principles relating to enumerating and describing bundles for the purposes of O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court. The starting point is that O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court requires a party providing a list of documents for the purposes of discovery to “enumerate the documents in a convenient order”, “describing each of them… sufficiently to enable it to be identified”. Proper listing of documents enables (a) the other party to ascertain and request for those he or she wishes to inspect; and (b) the court to determine whether the parties have complied with their discovery obligations and, if necessary, to make certain orders (including orders for production) in relation to the listed documents. See <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 20</span><span class="font-italic">21 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span>”) at paragraph 24/3/3 and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2021 </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2021</span>”) at paragraph 24/3/2. Compliance with the rule thus goes towards ensuring the conduct of litigation in an efficient, economical, and expeditious manner that is consistent with doing justice between the parties (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement </span>at [11]; for convenience, referred to hereinafter as the “Ideal”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As each case differs from the next and the discovery process must be tailored to the case at hand, it is difficult to provide formulaic guidance on when enumerating and describing bundles (in lieu of listing individual documents) is justified. However, I make four broad observations:   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, listing <span class="font-italic">individual</span> documents generally affords the greatest granularity and clarity, and best conduces to precision in future referencing. The usual practice is for documents to be listed individually, with enumerating and describing bundles of documents being an exception (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[7]). If a party giving discovery chooses to enumerate and describe bundles instead of listing individual documents, it must be prepared to provide adequate justification for doing so should the issue arise (as in the present application). This it may do by demonstrating that in the circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>the disputed issues, the number or types of documents at hand, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), enumerating and describing bundles would facilitate the abovementioned Ideal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the reference to “convenient order” in O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court refers to the convenience of the court and all parties involved in the litigation process. A party giving discovery should not enumerate and describe bundles solely on the basis of its own convenience (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>its unwillingness to invest time and effort in properly listing or organising the documents). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court provides that enumerating and describing bundles is limited to the situation where the documents are “<span class="font-italic">of the same nature</span>” (emphasis added). In <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement, </span>the court cited <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2007 </span>(GP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paragraph 24/3/5 for the proposition that “[d]iverse documents though dealing with the same subject-matter or transaction and filed or bundled together do not come within the exception”. While the court did not elaborate on the meaning of “diverse documents”, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement</span> itself (see [15] above) makes clear that the mere fact that a bundle contains different <span class="font-italic">types</span> of documents does not necessarily mean that the documents are considered “diverse documents” falling outside the exception. Indeed, the court held that these different document types constituted “documents of the same nature” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement </span>at [12]). The diversity referred to, therefore, relates to the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>rather than the <span class="font-italic">type </span>of documents. Put another way, documents of different <span class="font-italic">types </span>can come within the exception, so long as they are of the same <span class="font-italic">nature</span> for the purposes of the case at hand. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court requires that each bundle of documents be <span class="font-italic">sufficiently described</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11], the court referred to <span class="font-italic">DCH Legal Group v Skevington </span>[2001] WADC 116 at [8] for the observation that the description of each bundle must “accurately and adequately [describe] its contents and [specify] the dates between which the correspondence was produced”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I mention for completeness that in the context of electronic discovery (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the discovery of electronic copies of electronically stored documents), the court may dispense with the listing of individual documents, and instead order that each party provide “a meaningful description… for each category or sub-category in the list of documents” (see paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions). However, I say no more about this because Part V of the Supreme Court Practice directions does not apply to the present case (see paragraph 44(1) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I turn now to the present facts. On perusal of P4SLOD and the types of documents contained therein, there is scant justification for the Plaintiff to proceed by describing the five categories of documents as five bundles, instead of listing individual documents falling within each category.  I am unable to see how enumerating and describing bundles instead of listing individual documents in the present case would help to achieve the Ideal. Indeed, the difficulties that immediately spring to mind include the Defendant’s difficulty in making pinpoint references to specific documents that it wishes to inspect, and the court’s difficulty in determining if the individual documents are properly described (notwithstanding their detailed filenames). It would certainly be no mean feat to make precise references to the documents in the course of litigation without a proper and detailed listing. These observations are buttressed by the fact that the Plaintiff and its solicitors – on their own volition, it should be emphasised – took pains (and six additional working days) to carefully set out a softcopy folder hierarchy and provide detailed file-naming of the documents therein. Having already performed the considerably more time-consuming task of providing a softcopy folder hierarchy with documents bearing detailed individual filenames, I see no reason why the Plaintiff maintains its position that enumerating and describing bundles is sufficient in this case. Indeed, given the detailed file naming, the Plaintiff can easily leverage readily available software shortcuts and solutions to assist in extracting and listing the individual documents properly, although more details may have to be provided in the eventual list to meet the requirement of describing each item sufficiently for the purposes of O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 It appears to me that the Plaintiff filed P4SLOD in its present form because it required more time to organise the detailed listing of individual documents.

</div>
</div> If so, the proper course of action would have been to seek an extension of time instead of enumerating and describing bundles simply to meet the 28 October 2021 deadline. The Plaintiff should not rely solely on its own convenience – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, filing a generic list to meet a deadline or to avoid having to seek an extension of time from the court – to justify enumerating and describing bundles instead of listing individual documents (see [17(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As there is no justification for enumerating and describing bundles in this case, and doing so does not facilitate achievement of the Ideal, I find that P4SLOD does not comply with O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court. For completeness, however, I go on to consider whether the documents within the five bundles are “of the same nature”. In this regard, I would have been prepared to find that the bundles described in S/No 1, 2, 4 and 5 of P4SLOD contain documents “of the same nature”. However, there are complications with the bundle described in S/No 3 of P4SLOD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Within S/No 3 of P4SLOD, each individual softcopy Portable Document Format (“PDF”) file was a <span class="font-italic">composite </span>file comprising discrete documents. These “mini bundles” were (save for one, on which, see [24] below) identified by unique transaction numbers in their PDF filenames. Each PDF file contained various documents (<span class="font-italic">eg </span>contracts, invoices, purchase orders) purportedly connected to the transaction identified in the filename. The documents in each “mini bundle” appeared to be discrete hardcopy documents that were scanned into softcopy and furnished to the Plaintiff’s liquidators.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I accept the Plaintiff’s position that listing documents in sub-categories according to <span class="font-italic">document types</span> may not be the most efficient given the circumstances of the present case. However, the proper approach would be to list individual documents and organise these by sub-categories based on <span class="font-italic">specific </span><span class="font-italic">transactions</span>, which is – <span class="font-italic">in effect – </span>what the Plaintiff has done (save that the Plaintiff compiled them as “mini bundles” and omitted to itemise the documents therein). Listing documents in this manner will facilitate achieving the Ideal in the present case. Otherwise, possible confusion may arise, and further time and costs will be incurred, each time the court or the parties wishes to refer to a specific document <span class="font-italic">within </span>a “mini bundle”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 There was one PDF file within S/No 3 of P4SLOD that was not identified by a transaction number. Instead, it bore the filename “Offset Instructions.pdf”. The rationale for bundling these documents together in a composite PDF file is unclear. It is also unclear why these documents are said to be “of the same nature”. The individual documents ought to be listed individually, possibly under a suitable sub-category, and with a proper description of each document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 To conclude on the Enumeration and Description Issue, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with paragraph 1 of the Discovery Order. I therefore order that the Plaintiff is to comply with paragraph 1 of the Discovery Order by filing and serving on the Defendant a fresh SLOD and Verifying Affidavit within 21 days of this order. The fresh SLOD is to comply with the requirements in O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Inspection Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Paragraph 2 of the Discovery Order provides for inspection of the <span class="font-italic">originals</span> (if any) of the documents listed in P4SLOD within 14 days from the time P4SLOD and the Verifying Affidavit are served on the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the “Notice to Inspect” found within P4SLOD, the Plaintiff stated that the documents listed in Part 1 of P4SLOD may be inspected at the office of the Plaintiff’s solicitors by prior appointment between 10am and 4pm. However, in Part 1 of P4SLOD, the Plaintiff listed the documents as “copies unless otherwise stated”. In other words, the Plaintiff’s position was that it would provide inspection only of <span class="font-italic">copies</span> in Singapore. While one possible argument may be that this technically constitutes a breach of paragraph 2 of the Discovery Order (as there is no stated offer for the inspection of <span class="font-italic">originals</span>), the parties did not proceed on this basis. Instead, they crossed swords on the Plaintiff’s indication that it would provide the inspection of originals<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">in HKSAR</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Plaintiff explained that it had offered the inspection of originals in HKSAR due to numerous practical difficulties in bringing the originals to Singapore, namely: (a) the originals are within the purview of the liquidators of a related HKSAR company; (b) the originals are relevant to ongoing legal proceedings in HKSAR; and (c) it is not feasible for the Plaintiff to incur the hefty costs of shipping the voluminous originals to Singapore when the Defendant has not disputed the authenticity of any of the documents and has not identified exactly which originals it wishes to inspect.

In the circumstances, the necessity requirement in O 24 r 13(1) of the Rules of Court is best met by adopting a calibrated approach in relation to the time and place for the production of originals for inspection, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff is to provide inspection of the originals of the documents in S/No 3 of P4SLOD, limited to those which exist in their original form in hardcopy (including, for the avoidance of doubt, documents with wet-ink signatures and seals, electronic documents which were printed out and annotated, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), at the office of the Plaintiff’s solicitors, at a reasonable time to be agreed by parties.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Defendant provided two reasons for seeking this order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Plaintiff has not explained the failure to provide copies of the documents at the time of service of P4SLOD and the Verifying Affidavit. If the Plaintiff’s solicitors had the relevant documents in softcopy and had reviewed the documents prior to the filing of P4SLOD, they would have been able to provide copies of the same.

</div> The Plaintiff’s solicitors may therefore have breached their duty to supervise discovery (citing <span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong v Credit Industriel et Commercial and another appeal </span>[2013] 3 SLR 573 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong</span>”) at [43] to [49]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I do not think that these are sufficient reasons to warrant the order sought by the Defendant. I acknowledge that the Plaintiff has technically breached paragraph 3 of the Discovery Order by failing to provide the copies of the documents on 28 October 2021 or to seek an extension of time to do so. However, the Plaintiff has provided an explanation for this delay (see [8] above) and stated on affidavit that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had reviewed the documents prior to the filing of P4SLOD.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of Bob Yap Cheng Ghee (dated 12 January 2022) at paragraph 20.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong</span>, when considering the practical applications of a solicitor’s duty in discovery, the Court of Appeal cited a passage from<span class="font-italic"> Myers v Elman </span>[1940] AC 282, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">He is at an early stage of the proceedings engaged in putting before the Court on the oath of his client information which may afford evidence at the trial. Obviously <span class="font-italic">he must explain to his client what is the meaning of relevance: and equally obviously he must not necessarily be satisfied by the statement of his client that he has no documents or no more than he chooses to disclose</span>. <span class="font-italic">If he has reasonable ground for supposing that there are others, he must investigate the matter</span>; but he need not go beyond taking reasonable steps to ascertain the truth. He is not the ultimate judge, and if he reasonably decides to believe his client, criticism cannot be directed to him. [emphasis added in <span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong</span>] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong</span>, the party in question had breached its discovery obligations by failing to disclose certain evidence. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal invited the party to consider waiving privilege and disclosing the legal advice it received in relation to discovery (<span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong </span>at [46]). The Court of Appeal also took the view that the documents that the party had failed to disclose appeared to be the sort that would likely have emerged had the party’s solicitors taken the necessary steps in relation to discovery (see <span class="font-italic">Teo Wai Cheong </span>at [49]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In contrast, in the present case, there is no indication or finding made that the Plaintiff had failed to disclose any documents. The Defendant’s main concern relates to precisely how the Plaintiff’s solicitors supervised the discovery process given that the originals of the documents were in HKSAR, but the Defendant was unable to provide any basis (beyond suspicion and speculation) for suggesting that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had failed to provide the necessary supervision, or that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had failed to investigate when there was reasonable ground for supposing that the disclosed documents were inadequate. As such, I decline to grant the order sought, without prejudice to the Defendant’s right to apply afresh if any non-disclosure has been positively identified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Unless Order Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is well established that an unless order, particularly one with the effect that an entire action be struck out, is an order of last resort when the defaulter’s conduct is inexcusable (see <span class="font-italic">Mitora Pte Ltd v Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 1179 (“<span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>”) at [45(a)]). The conditions appended to an unless order should, as far as possible, be tailored to the prejudice which would be suffered should there be non-compliance (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [45(b)]). As explained in <span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [46], the “draconian sanction of striking out a litigant’s claim… in its entirety should not be the default consequence of an ‘unless order’ as it would effectively deprive the litigant of its <span class="font-italic">substantive </span>rights on account of a <span class="font-italic">procedural </span>fault” (emphasis in original).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the present case, there is simply no evidence that the Plaintiff has routinely or repeatedly failed to comply with orders, or that the Plaintiff’s conduct is inexcusable. The Defendant also did not attempt to tailor the order sought to the prejudice suffered in the event of non-compliance. The Defendant’s seeking of an unless order with the effect that the Plaintiff’s action be struck out upon non-compliance is, to adapt language from <span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [44], an attempt to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. I therefore decline to make any unless order in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the foregoing reasons, I decline to grant the unless orders sought. Instead, I make the following orders: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff is to comply with paragraph 1 of the Discovery Order by filing and serving on the Defendant a fresh SLOD and Verifying Affidavit within 21 days of this order. The fresh SLOD is to comply with the requirements in O 24 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The Plaintiff is to provide inspection of the originals of the documents in S/No 3 of P4SLOD, limited to those which exist in their original form in hardcopy (including, for the avoidance of doubt, documents with wet-ink signatures and seals, electronic documents which were printed out and annotated, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), at the office of the Plaintiff’s solicitors, at a reasonable time to be agreed by parties. Failing agreement, either party is at liberty to apply to the court for directions.  </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) For all other documents, should the Defendant wish to inspect originals, the Plaintiff is to provide inspection of the originals at a reasonable time and place to be agreed by the parties, failing which at the Plaintiff’s or their representative’s offices in HKSAR at a reasonable time to be agreed by the parties. Failing agreement, either party is at liberty to apply to the court for directions.  </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I will hear parties on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Justin Yeo <br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ms Premalatha Silwaraju and Ms Joelle Tan<br/>(M/s Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the Plaintiff. <br/>Mr Niklas Wong and Mr Uday Duggal <br/>(M/s TSMP Law Corporation) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
