<i xmlns=""><b>
<p>Introduction</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">            The

appellant, Kenneth Nicholas (‘Kenneth’) faced a total of seven charges for a

variety of offences before the district courts. In DAC No 15228 of 2002 &amp; 4 ors, he

pleaded guilty to four charges and agreed to have the fifth charge taken into

consideration before district judge Audrey Lim. In DAC No 15227 of 2002 &amp; anor, he

pleaded guilty to a further two offences before district judge Mavis Chionh. On the

morning of 12 August 2002, he was sentenced by district judge Lim to 20 years’

preventive detention and a total of 12 strokes for the offences in DAC No 15228. Later

that afternoon, district judge Chionh ordered that Kenneth serve a sentence of 20

years’ preventive detention and suffer three strokes of the cane for the offences in

DAC No 15227. The district judge also ordered that both terms of preventive detention

imposed by district judge Lim and by herself should run from the date of the sentences.

This meant that Kenneth would effectively serve a total of 20 years’ preventive

detention. Kenneth, being dissatisfied with the decisions in DAC No 15228 and DAC No 15227

appealed against the sentences in both cases. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Undisputed facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        In DAC No 15228, Kenneth

was charged with five offences. The first charge alleged that he had kidnapped N, a

nine-year old girl, at about 10:30 pm on 22 May 2001, an offence punishable under s 363 of

the Penal Code (Cap 224). By the second charge, he was accused of using criminal force

with intent to outrage N’s modesty, by touching her chest region including her breast

with his hand, contrary to s 354. By the third charge, Kenneth was accused of another

offence under s 363 for kidnapping Q, a five-year old girl, on 20 December 2001, at about

10:30 pm. Fourthly, he was charged with using criminal force with intent to outrage her

modesty, by inserting his finger to her vulva and causing fear of instant hurt to Q, an

offence punishable under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code. Kenneth pleaded guilty to all of

these offences. Finally, he also consented to having the fifth charge brought against him

taken into consideration. That charge alleged that he voluntarily caused hurt to Q by

slapping her on the face, an offence punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        In her grounds of decision,

district judge Lim set out the facts relating to the four charges which Kenneth pleaded

guilty to as follows:</p>

    about 10.00 p.m., [N] had left her flat to go to the provision shop to buy some bread. As

    she was leaving the shop and walking home, Kenneth approached her and told her that he had

    arranged with her father for her to follow him. [N] agreed as she was unaware that Kenneth

    had deceived her and was abducting her. They walked towards the bus stop and boarded a

    bus. Whilst in the bus, Kenneth used his hand to touch her chest and breast. She felt

    uneasy and tried to move away but failed. During the journey, he also gave her a few

    tablets to consume. She felt drowsy and passed out. When she regained consciousness, she

    found herself stranded at MacRitchie Reservoir. A passer-by found her and alerted the

    police. Kenneth was subsequently arrested on 27 December 2001. </p>

    2001, [Q]’s mother was selling durians at a makeshift stall at Redhill Close. [Q] and

    her elder sister played in the vicinity whilst accompanying their mother. Subsequently [Q]

    became separated from her elder sister and was left alone. At about 10.30 p.m., Kenneth

    approached her and forced her to follow him, carrying her on his shoulders. She cried for

    help but to no avail. Kenneth brought her to Redhill MRT station and boarded the MRT to

    Pasir Ris where he brought her to his home. He made [Q] lie beside him on the bed, removed

    her clothes, fondled her groin area and inserted his finger to her vulva. He then

    masturbated himself and ejaculated in her presence. The next morning, he brought her to

    the MRT station and they took the MRT to Redhill, where they alighted. He then left her by

    herself and disappeared. [Q] walked to the hawker centre in the vicinity of Redhill Close

    and a stranger brought her home.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        In DAC No 15227, Kenneth

pleaded guilty to kidnapping Z, a seven-year old girl, on 25 December 2001, at about 1 am,

contrary to s 363 of the Penal Code. District judge Chionh set out the facts relating to

this offence, in her judgment, as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">3 …..The victim, [Z], is 7 years old. On 24

    December 2001, she was at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) with [Z’s father] and

    other family members. They were visiting the victim’s grandmother who was then warded

    in Ward 46. At about 11 pm that day, the victim and her father fell asleep on the couch at

    the visitors’ waiting area outside Ward 46.</p>
<p align="justify">4        At about 1 am on 25

    December 2001, the accused came to Ward 46. He carried the victim out of the ward and took

    her home in a taxi. Once home, he took her into his room where she fell asleep on his bed,

    next to him.</p>
<p align="justify">5        Sometime later that

    morning, the accused brought the victim back to SGH in another taxi. The victim

    subsequently met her father in the vicinity where she was dropped off by the accused.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Kenneth also pleaded guilty

to a charge of having two prohibited publications, a "Playboy" magazine and a

"Penthouse" magazine, in his possession, contrary to s 6(2) of the Undesirable

Publications Act. The police found the magazines in his house when they searched it on 29

December 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The facts relating to all

the offences that Kenneth was charged with were not in dispute. For the purposes of these

appeals, I adopted the facts as set out in the judgments of both the district judges. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decisions below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        Both of the district judges

found that Kenneth was a great danger to society at large. Consequently, they were of the

view that the maximum period of preventive detention, ie 20 years, was the appropriate

sentence in their respective cases. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        District judge Lim

reasoned, in her grounds of decision, as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">… It is clear from Kenneth’s antecedents that

    he is indeed a menace to society. Now 49 years old, his criminal career began in 1972 and

    he has chalked up a total of 19 offences, not including the present offences before me.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">10        Indeed his

    history of kidnapping and molesting young children is very disturbing. His first offence

    for outraging modesty began in 1980, and in 1986 he had already garnered a string of

    kidnapping offences with outraging of modesty and criminal intimidation. He repeated his

    criminal acts again when he was dealt with for another string of offences in 1993 for

    outraging the modesty of children under the age of 14 and was sentenced to eight

    years’ preventive detention and eight strokes of the cane. Shortly after his release

    from preventive detention, he committed similar offences again, which formed the charges

    before me….It is clear that the previous term of preventive detention had not

    deterred him from repeating such heinous activities and he continues to pose a grave

    threat and danger to the public at large, especially to young children. Indeed, the

    preventive detention report also found Kenneth to be at high risk of sexual offending.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        District judge Chionh gave

the following reasons for sentencing Kenneth to a period of 20 years’ preventive

detention. In her judgment:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">15        In the

    present case, apart from the accused’s plea of guilt, there were no mitigating

    factors. The alleged misery of his childhood as well as his emotional and mental problems

    did not hold any real mitigatory value. Moreover, any mitigatory value due to his plea of

    guilt was far outweighed by the element of public interest. Having considered the

    accused’s previous record as well as the facts of the present offences, I was of the

    view that he was a menace to society. The preventive detention report, which found the

    accused to be at high risk of sexual re-offending, confirmed my view. Indeed from the

    report, it was clear that the accused lacked any sort of remorse or insight insofar as his

    criminal activities were concerned: according to the prison psychiatrist, he attempted to

    minimise the consequences of his actions, and instead, blamed "alcohol and his

    hallucinations".</p>
<p align="justify">16        In short, preventive

    detention was plainly called for in the interest of protecting the public – and

    especially young females – from the accused. Bearing in mind the fact that the

    accused committed the present offences shortly after his release from eight years’

    preventive detention, I decided that the maximum period of preventive detention was

    warranted.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Furthermore, district

judge Chionh ordered that the sentence which she imposed on Kenneth commence on the same

day as the sentence imposed by district judge Lim, ie 12 August 2002. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Kenneth was sentenced to

three strokes of the cane for each of the four charges before district judge Lim to

reflect the severity of the offences which he committed. District judge Chionh also

sentenced Kenneth to three strokes of the cane on the kidnapping charge before her for the

same reason. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        Kenneth appealed against

the sentences of preventive detention meted out to him in both cases. He claimed that he

was remorseful and promised not to re-offend. Furthermore, he asked the Court to consider

his appeal favourably because of his age, the fact that he was doing church work and as

his family needed him. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        The prosecution submitted

that the total sentence of 20 years’ preventive detention and 15 strokes of the cane

imposed by the district judges was not manifestly excessive, taking into account the

aggravating manner in which the offences were committed, Kenneth’s previous

antecedents, his propensity to commit sexual offences against young and vulnerable girls

and the need to protect the general public from such a menace to society.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The law</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        At the outset, it was

necessary to consider a novel point of law that was raised as a result of the factual

matrix of these appeals. Kenneth had been sentenced by district judge Lim to 20

years’ preventive detention on 12 August 2002 which ran from the date of the order.

Thus, he was already undergoing a sentence of preventive detention when he appeared before

district judge Chionh later in the same day. She decided that, in such circumstances, the

court had to order that the two sentences of preventive detention that were meted out to

Kenneth must run concurrently. The issue that had to be decided was whether the court was

limited to ordering that a subsequent sentence of preventive detention should run

concurrently with the other sentence of preventive detention that the accused was

undergoing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        The only provision in the

Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) that deals with the commencement of subsequent sentences

when the accused is serving another sentence is s 234(1). Thus, it was necessary to

construe the ambit of this section to resolve the issue before me. It reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">When a person who is an escaped convict or is undergoing

    a <i>sentence of imprisonment</i> is sentenced to imprisonment the latter sentence of

    imprisonment shall commence either immediately or at the expiration of the imprisonment to

    which he was previously sentenced as the court awarding the sentence directs. (my

    emphasis)</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        The principles governing

the interpretation of statutes are as follows: s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act makes it

imperative that the court adopts a purposive construction of a provision, and not merely a

literal interpretation. That section reads: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">In the interpretation of a provision of written law, an

    interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law

    (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be

    preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        In <i>Constitutional

Reference No 1 of 1995 </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9167&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 201</a>, I delivered the judgment of the Constitution

of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal and elaborated on how statutory interpretation

should be carried out, in the following words, at p 210:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">It is well established …that a purposive

    interpretation should be adopted in interpreting the Constitution to give effect to the

    intent and will of Parliament. The principle to be applied is that the words of the Act

    are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense,

    harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of

    Parliament: EA Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes </i>(2nd Ed, 1983) p 87</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        The court also decided

that, by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act, a purposive construction of a statutory

provision should be adopted over a literal interpretation that does not support the

purpose and object of the written law, even if the wording of the statute is not ambiguous

or inconsistent. At p 211 of my judgment, I quoted with approval the following judgment of

Dawson J in <i>Mills v Meeking</i> (1990) 169 CLR 214:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…. the approach required by s 35 [which corresponds<i>
</i>with s 9A(1)] needs no ambiguity or inconsistency; <i>it allows a court to consider

    the purposes of an Act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction</i>.

    Reference to the purposes may reveal that the draftsman had inadvertently overlooked

    something which he would have dealt with had his attention been drawn to it and if it is

    possible as a matter of construction to repair the defect, then this must be done. (my

    emphasis)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This approach has been followed in numerous local cases, notably, the

decisions of the Court of Appeal in <i>L &amp; W Holdings Pte. Ltd. v Management

Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1601 </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44193&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 905</a> and of the High Court in <i>PP

v Knight Glenn Jeyasingam </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48322&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 2 SLR 499</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        Bearing these principles

in mind, I considered the construction of s 234(1) of the CPC. In my view, on a literal

reading of the subsection, s 234(1) does not apply when the accused is a person undergoing

a sentence of preventive detention as it only refers to offenders who are undergoing a

"sentence of imprisonment". A sentence of preventive detention is not a

"sentence of imprisonment", even though persons sentenced to preventive

detention are often, in practice, detained in prison. In <i>Yusoff bin Hassan &amp; Ors v

PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6510&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 1032</a>, I drew a distinction between the two sentencing options for the

following reasons: first, s 12(2) of the CPC, the provision which empowers the court to

order a sentence of preventive detention states that such sentences are passed "in

lieu of any sentence of imprisonment"; secondly, there are different rules relating

to the nature and termination of custody for sentences of imprisonment and preventive

detention. Sentences of imprisonment are governed by the Prisons Act and its regulations,

while sentences of preventive detention are governed by the Criminal Procedure (Corrective

Training and Preventive Detention) Rules. There is usually a one-third period of remission

for sentences of imprisonment, but not for terms of preventive detention. Consequently, a

literal reading of s 234(1) would mean that the court is not empowered to order that a

sentence of preventive detention should start at the expiration of another such sentence

that the accused is undergoing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        Hence, the literal reading

of s 234(1) reveals that the draftsman had overlooked the provision of rules to deal with

the issue of when a subsequent sentence of preventive detention should commence if the

accused is already serving another sentence of preventive detention. Section 12(2) of the

CPC is also silent on this issue. It states that the court may order a term of preventive

detention of not more than 20 years in one trial but does not deal with a situation where

there are two separate trials in which sentences of preventive detention are warranted.

Furthermore, an examination of the rest of the CPC showed that there are no specific

provisions addressing this issue. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        In these circumstances, it

was my duty to consider the purpose of s 234(1) in the context of the CPC as a whole to

determine if there was more than one possible construction of the section and, if so, to

repair the defect in drafting. By s 234(1), the court is given an option to order that an

offender effectively serve out the entire length of imprisonment over and above another

sentence that he is serving if such a sentence is warranted in the circumstances of a

subsequent trial. In my view, the intention of Parliament in passing s 234(1), was to

ensure that the courts have the power to ensure that the aggregate sentence that is

imposed on an offender through multiple trials is reflective of the seriousness of the

offences that formed the basis of subsequent trials when an offender is already serving a

sentence. In other words, I took the opinion that Parliament did not intend to tie the

hands of the court, such that it can <i>never</i> order consecutive sentences of

preventive detention in whatever circumstances, even if a longer aggregate sentence is

necessary, to reflect the extent to which an offender is a menace to society and the

severity of the offences which formed the basis of the subsequent trial. Accordingly, a

construction of s 234(1) that fulfils the intention of Parliament is that the section

applies equally to offenders who are serving a sentence of imprisonment or preventive

detention so that the court has the same options in determining the commencement of

subsequent sentences in both cases. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        By s 9A(1) of the

Interpretation Act, it was necessary for me to adopt the purposive construction of s

234(1) over the literal interpretation of the subsection, which does not promote the

objects of the subsection. The purposive construction of s 234(1) is consistent with

logic, the intention of Parliament and the context of the words in s 234(1). On the other

hand, the literal interpretation of s 234(1) restricts the court’s options in

sentencing and leads to an absurd result. An illustration of the absurdity which may arise

from a literal reading of s 234(1) is this: A person, who has a history of committing

sexual offences, has been tried, convicted and sentenced to preventive detention of 15

years for three offences of outrage of modesty. He has just started serving his sentence

when the police subsequently discover that he was responsible for a string of serious

sexual offences, for example rape. He is convicted for the subsequent offences, which of

themselves warrant the maximum sentence of preventive detention of 20 years. By a literal

reading of s 234(1), the court does not have the power to order that the latter sentence

run after the expiration of the first sentence and it is effectively limited to ordering

slightly more than an additional five years of preventive detention. Such a sentence does

not truly reflect the extent to which the offender is a menace to the public, based on the

convictions in the subsequent trial. The offender effectively obtains a

"discount" on the actual period of preventive detention that he would otherwise

have to serve on the facts of the second trial, on account of the fact that he is already

undergoing preventive detention.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        At this juncture, I turned

to consider the counter arguments which may be raised against the purposive interpretation

of s 234(1). I noted that, although district judge Chionh ruled that she was not empowered

to order that the sentence which she imposed on Kenneth run at the expiration of the

sentence of preventive detention he was undergoing, she did not give reasons to support

her decision. Nevertheless, I found that there were two potential sources of concern in

adopting the purposive interpretation of s 234(1). First, that the courts would be

empowered by a purposive reading of the subsection to impose longer aggregate sentences of

preventive detention in excess of 20 years and that such sentences, which have never been

imposed previously, may be too crushing. Secondly, another concern was that strategic

decisions as to whether a string of offences should be prosecuted in a joint trial or

separate trials, which should not affect sentencing, would influence the maximum aggregate

sentence of preventive detention that a court can order. This is an incidental result of

the purposive interpretation of s 234(1) which empowers the court to order an aggregate

sentence that far exceeds the maximum limit of 20 years that can be imposed in a joint

trial, if the prosecution of the offences are heard in separate trials. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        I was of the view that

these concerns should not prevent me from adopting the interpretation of s 234(1) that

fulfills the intention of Parliament due to the supremacy of s 9A(1) of the Interpretation

Act. In any case, the concerns did not detract from the need for the courts to have the

power to order that sentences of preventive detention meted out in separate cases run

consecutively, so that it may be exercised in cases which warrant it. The concerns

actually relate to the consequences of the potential wrongful exercise of such a power and

not its existence. However, the potential harm that may occur in the exercise of the power

cannot be a good reason for the total rejection of this power. The solution should be a

careful application of the power to the facts, such that consecutive sentences of

preventive detention are only imposed in appropriate cases. Undoubtedly, in the exercise

of their powers, the courts would apply caution and balance sentencing objectives to

ensure that the aggregate sentence passed is not any more or less than a sentence that is

reflective of the extent to which the offender is a menace to society. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        Insofar as the concerns

stemmed from the notion that the courts should not be empowered to sentence offenders to

an aggregate term of preventive detention in excess of 20 years, they must be rejected as

such a notion is without legal premise. Section 12(2) does state that the maximum sentence

in <i>one trial</i> is 20 years. The power to impose an aggregate sentence of more than 20

years when there are multiple sentences of preventive detention ordered in <i>separate

trials</i> is in no way inconsistent with the CPC.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        In conclusion, it was my

duty to "repair the omission" which resulted from the draftsman’s failure

to provide rules for the commencement of subsequent sentences of preventive detention when

an offender is already serving a sentence of preventive detention. I adopted the purposive

interpretation of s 234 of the CPC and ruled that the section also applies to persons who

are undergoing a sentence of preventive detention. Accordingly, a court that is faced with

sentencing an offender who is already undergoing a sentence of preventive detention has

the same options as if the offender is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment, i.e. it can

order that the subsequent period of preventive detention commence on the date of the

judgment or at the expiry of the earlier sentence of preventive detention. In exercising

its powers, the court would only order that sentences of preventive detention run

consecutively if it was necessary to reflect the extent to which he is a threat to the

community. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appropriate sentence in this case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        Kenneth started his life

of crime in 1972 when he was about 19 years old. He had a disturbing history of kidnapping

and molesting young children. In 1980, he was first convicted of and fined for one charge

of outrage of modesty. Subsequently, in 1986, he was convicted of two charges of

kidnapping, with a further charge taken into consideration, one charge of outrage of

modesty and one charge of criminal intimidation, with another taken into consideration. A

total sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was imposed on him. After his release, he

did not keep away from his criminal activities for long. In 1993, he was hauled back to

court to face eight counts of outraging the modesty of a child under the age of 14,

contrary to s 354A(2)(B) of the Penal Code. He was convicted on four of the charges and

the rest of the charges were taken into consideration. At that stage, he had already

qualified for a sentence of preventive detention as he was found to be a menace to society

and the judge imposed a sentence of eight years’ preventive detention on him, in

addition to eight strokes of the cane. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        The period of

incarceration for preventive detention obviously did nothing to deter him from committing

his most recent string of similar offences which formed the basis of the present charges

against him. Barely two months after his release from preventive detention in March 2001,

Kenneth struck again by kidnapping and molesting N. In December 2001, he repeated his

abominable pattern of crime by kidnapping and molesting yet another two young and

vulnerable girls, Q and Z just days apart from each other. Kenneth’s record of

kidnapping and outraging the modesty of young and vulnerable victims was the clearest

illustration of his recalcitrant nature. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        The preventive detention

report and the various medical reports on him also supported the conclusion that Kenneth

was incorrigible. In the preventive detention report, he was found to have a high risk of

sexual re-offending. In the medical reports, the doctors concluded that he had "an

abnormal sexual drive directed at pre-adolescent girls" and he suffered from

"deviant sexual behaviour". In the latest report dated 16 May 2002 by a

psychiatrist on Kenneth, he was described as a person who "never got his act together

as an adult and was a "basket case" collecting psychiatric and social

disabilities….". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        Kenneth’s repeated

re-offending showed that he was beyond redemption. He was completely unable to exert any

form of self-control over his sexual behaviour. Such a failure would invariably find

expression in the heinous crimes of kidnapping and molesting young girls. Undoubtedly, he

posed a great threat to society, particularly as his targets were young girls who were

unable to fend for themselves. His crimes had already caused many families and young girls

to suffer a great deal of trauma. As he demonstrated no ability to control himself, it was

necessary to sentence him to a suitably long period of preventive detention to take him

out of circulation for as long as it was necessary for the protection of society. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31        Both district judges Lim

and Chionh decided that the offences that Kenneth had committed and which formed the basis

of the charges before them individually warranted the imposition of the maximum sentence

of 20 years’ preventive detention. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        Kenneth submitted that

this Court should consider the following factors, ie his age; the hardship that his family

would suffer due to his incarceration; his church work; his claims of remorse and his

promise that he would not re-offend. After considering Kenneth’s numerous antecedents

and his medical reports, I was unconvinced that he would not re-offend or that he felt

genuine remorse about his crimes. In any case, in meting out sentences of preventive

detention, the primary consideration is the need to put away persons who are deemed to be

a menace to society for the safety of the community at large: <i>Yusoff bin Hassan &amp; 4

Ors v PP.</i> Consequently, in light of the manifest need to protect the public from him,

the factors mentioned by Kenneth could not be used to reduce the terms of preventive

detention that were imposed on him. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33        After a review of all the

relevant facts in relation to MA 211 of 2002 and the reasons given by district judge Lim

in imposing 20 years’ preventive detention on Kenneth, I ruled that the district

judge had ample reasons to support her decision, that he was such a menace to society that

he should be locked away for 20 years in preventive detention, and I upheld her decision. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34        However, I did not agree

with district judge Chionh’s decision to sentence Kenneth to 20 years’

preventive detention that would run concurrently with his earlier sentence, such that he

would effectively serve only 20 years’ preventive detention. By the offences that

Kenneth pleaded guilty to in the first trial, his conduct already warranted a maximum term

of 20 years’ preventive detention. Over and above those offences, he kidnapped

another young and vulnerable victim, Z, which proved that he was such a great menace to

the public that he should be locked away for more than the 20 years in aggregate for the

community’s protection. This was particularly because Kenneth was only 49 years old

at the time of these appeals. An aggregate sentence of only 20 years would mean that he

would be released when he is 69, an age when he would still be capable of harming more

victims. Accordingly, I ordered that the sentence imposed on Kenneth for MA 210 of 2002

would commence only at the expiration of the sentence of 20 years’ preventive

detention that he was undergoing. However, I reduced the sentence that he must serve for

the offences in DAC 15227 to ten years since he had only been found guilty of one more

offence of kidnapping. This meant that the aggregate sentence of preventive detention that

Kenneth must serve would be 30 years and that he would be taken out of circulation until

he is 79 years old with a probably reduced libido.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35        For the above reasons, I

dismissed the appeal in MA 211 of 2002. However, I allowed the appeal in MA 210 of 2002

and reduced the term of preventive detention imposed on Kenneth from 20 years to ten

years. Furthermore, I ordered that the sentence of ten years’ preventive detention

would only commence on the expiration of the sentence in MA 211 of 2002, ie the aggregate

period of preventive detention would be 30 years. I also ordered that the sentences of

three and twelve strokes of the cane in MA 210 and MA 211 of 2002 respectively, were to

remain.</p>
