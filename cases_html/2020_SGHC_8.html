</div> simply made no sense. Even if the officers had refused to believe in Salleh’s innocence, this did not support a belief that these officers would ignore his allegations of mistreatment. This also failed to explain why Salleh did not complain to someone other than the CNB officers, especially after he was transferred from CNB’s custody to that of Prisons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 A further difficulty with Salleh’s account was his allegation that SSSgt Abdillah had entered the CNB car in the middle of the statement recording to shout at him (see [10] above). I have not been given any reason to believe that SSSgt Abdillah would have entered the car during the statement recording. Further, according to Salleh, SSSgt Abdillah had entered the car “reaching” for something, “overheard the conversation” with Insp Faizal, and then shouted at him.

</div> I did not see why the CNB officers would lie about this particular detail if SSSgt Abdillah had in fact entered the car for an initially innocuous reason, as Salleh had alleged. I preferred the consistent evidence of Insp Faizal, SSSgt Abdillah, and DSP Lek that no one entered the CNB car in the middle of the statement recording (see [13] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Further, Insp Faizal and SSSgt Abdillah have categorically denied Salleh’s allegations against them. This was supported by the evidence of the five other CNB officers who were in the vicinity (see [11] and [12] above). Although it was not suggested that the five CNB officers kept a close watch on what was happening in the CNB car during the statement recording, it seemed remarkable that none of them would have seen Insp Faizal attempting to punch Salleh, and that all of them would have found Salleh’s demeanour unremarkable afterwards, if Salleh’s account of the statement recording were true. The only alternative explanation for Salleh’s account was that the five CNB officers, together with Insp Faizal and SSSgt Abdillah, had conspired to lie in court, but I could see no reason to prefer Salleh’s account over theirs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Finally, it was worth noting that as far as Salleh’s allegations regarding being told not to lie, to cooperate, not to give “a hard time”, and that he was facing the death penalty were concerned, these in the first place would not ordinarily be capable of amounting to threats or inducements, or oppression, so as to undermine the voluntariness of the ensuing statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Salleh’s cautioned statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Salleh’s account of ASP Lee’s alleged inducements to him was lacking in both coherence and detail.

Thus, the charge against Salleh required him to have knowledge of the existence of the bundles in Hadi’s possession, and knowledge that they contained methamphetamine (see <span class="font-italic">Andi Ashwar</span> at [84]–[86]). It also required Salleh to know that Hadi intended to possess the bundles for the purpose of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With reference to the first element of Salleh’s knowledge of the existence of the bundles, this element would be made out if Salleh had known of the number of bundles which Hadi was to collect.

Yet, in response, Salleh did not say anything to Hadi that would suggest that this was a startling piece of news.

</div> I did not accept this characterisation of the messages. Salleh’s surprise was clearly directed at the confusion caused by the message “3pkt 2pkt”, which made it unclear as to precisely how many packets “Kakak” had given Hadi. This confusion might have been compounded by the subsequent message “5pkt 100x5”, given that Salleh had been asking “Kakak” whether she had given Hadi <span class="font-italic">two or three</span> packets. At all times, Salleh’s baseline understanding was that Hadi had collected two packets: “He told me only 2pkt”. In the end, Salleh’s message to Hadi explaining that the two packets he had collected contained a total of five smaller packets indicated that Salleh had no actual aversion to trafficking in quantities of methamphetamine larger than 250g. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I should add that in relation to the message “100x5”, Salleh accepted that it would have suggested to him that the drugs weighed 500g.

</div> further undermined his defence. Even on Salleh’s own case, there was no assertion that he had discussed with <span class="font-italic">Hadi</span> the fact that there was an excess bundle. This was hard to believe if Salleh’s evidence on his agreement with Hadi were true. Moreover, if such an agreement existed, Hadi himself would have been startled and concerned once he realised that he had received two bundles from “Kakak” weighing about 500g, a far cry from the 250g specified in the agreement. One would expect Hadi to have expressed this concern to Salleh. This did not happen. In sum, the phone records entirely discredited Salleh’s account of his agreements with Hadi and “Kakak” limiting the quantity of drugs he was willing to deal with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I also rejected Salleh’s submission that his defence at trial was consistent with that indicated in his cautioned statement (see [29] above). In Salleh’s cautioned statement, all he said was “… <span class="font-italic">I wasn’t aware of the number of packages</span> of the drugs that was with ‘Bear’” [emphasis added] (see [25] above). Not only was the assertion a clear lie (see [37] above), it was also very different from Salleh’s defence, which was that he had a <span class="font-italic">positive</span> <span class="font-italic">belief</span> that Hadi would not have collected more than one package of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Salleh’s defence was also not stated in his contemporaneous statement – which was in fact in substance an admission to the charge.

Salleh’s defence was an afterthought which he deployed only because he had failed in his challenge to the admissibility of his contemporaneous and cautioned statements. As such, I found that Salleh satisfied the element of knowledge I referred to at [32] above. Since this was the only issue in contention by the end of the trial, and I was satisfied that every other element of the charge was made out on the evidence, I concluded that the charge against Salleh had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The case in relation to Hadi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I turn now to the case in relation to Hadi.

Indeed, there was no reason to think that the bundles were intended for Hadi himself, whether they contained gold and cash or drugs. Since Hadi was in possession of the drugs, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) MDA applied. To rebut the s 18(2) presumption, Hadi had to “lead evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the drug” (<span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>”) at [37]). As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, <span class="font-italic">he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying</span>, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. … Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (‘the purported item’), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry. For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. … <span class="font-italic">Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true).

Instead, it was raised in his 27 July statement, which was recorded five days after his arrest. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Hadi failed to raise this defence in his first and second contemporaneous statements or in his cautioned statement.

</div>
</div> In the light of the lack of consistency in Hadi’s allegations, I preferred SSgt Fardlie’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Hadi’s explanation in respect of his first contemporaneous statement, that he simply failed to think of his defence at the time, was also difficult to believe. This was especially considering his assertion that he had, very shortly before that (either during the recording of his s 33B statement, or when the two bundles were first recovered), told SSgt Fardlie that very defence. As for Hadi’s explanation that he was shocked and did not realise the importance of his cautioned statement, this was undermined by the fact that the cautioned statement contained a warning in the form set out in s 23 CPC, informing the accused person of the importance of stating his defence therein. It was recorded in Hadi’s cautioned statement that this warning was read out to Hadi, and he had appended his signature beneath it. Since Hadi did not challenge the fact that this warning had been administered to him, I did not accept that he would not have realised the need to state his defence that he had thought the bundles contained gold and cash at least by that point in time. In other words, I inferred that this defence was an afterthought concocted only after the recording of Hadi’s cautioned statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Hadi’s account of why he only checked the contents of the bundle during his first delivery for Salleh was also internally inconsistent. In Hadi’s 27 July statement, he said that Salleh discovered that he had opened the bundle in the first delivery because Hadi had personally handed Salleh the torn bundle.

In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi</span> [2015] SGCA 33 at [60], the Court of Appeal summarised the criteria for finding that lies told out of court by an accused person corroborated his guilt (known as <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies, after <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lucas (Ruth)</span> [1981] QB 720 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>”)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The lie told out of court is deliberate;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) It relates to a material issue;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In my view, Hadi’s initial claims about never having met Salleh were deliberate lies on a material issue which have been shown to be lies by Hadi’s own admissions (which was independent evidence within the meaning of the <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> test: see <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> at 724G). If one were to consider why Hadi would have told these lies, the irresistible conclusion was that it must be because Salleh was jointly engaged in drug trafficking with him, and so distancing himself from the offence required distancing himself from Salleh. If Hadi’s defence had been about transporting gold and cash all along, one would expect him to have mounted that defence instead. Since the gold and cash defence was premised upon Salleh being a gold and currency investor, it would have made no sense for Hadi to dissociate himself from Salleh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Between his statements and his testimony at the trial, Hadi also prevaricated over the number of deliveries he had made for Salleh,

</div> While I considered the numerous inconsistencies in Hadi’s evidence to signify his general lack of credibility as a witness, I did not think that these inconsistencies provided concrete reasons to think that he was guilty of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Prosecution further submitted that the frequent use of code words such as “squid” in the communications between Salleh and Hadi, and the furtive manner in which the items were delivered by Hadi suggested that he could not genuinely have been dealing in gold and cash.

</div> I did not find these matters to be of much probative value, since on Hadi’s own case he would also have thought that he was doing something illegal (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, purportedly evading tax).

As I have mentioned at [45] above, one prong of Salleh’s defence was that he had a specific agreement with Hadi not to traffic in more than 250g of methamphetamine. Salleh’s evidence was therefore that Hadi was fully aware that the packages he was collecting contained methamphetamine, and furthermore that Salleh did not deal in gold and cash and had never instructed Hadi to transport gold and cash.

</div> According to the Prosecution, notwithstanding the fact that Salleh had lied about the existence of an agreement with Hadi to limit the quantity of methamphetamine trafficked, the remainder of Salleh’s evidence as to his agreement with Hadi was credible. On the other hand, Hadi strenuously contended that Salleh’s evidence could not be trusted, as he had been found to have been dishonest in challenging the admissibility of his contemporaneous and cautioned statements (see [8] above), after which he radically changed his defence and incriminated Hadi.

As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Norasharee bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 820 at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… X may be convicted solely on Y’s testimony. However, the foregoing discussion shows that Y’s confession has to be very compelling such that it can on its own satisfy the court of X’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard, <span class="font-italic">it would be relevant to consider the state of mind and the incentive that Y might have in giving evidence against X</span>. If X alleges that Y has a motive to frame him, then this must be proved as a fact … . Of course, <span class="font-italic">Y may well be truthful despite having an incentive to lie or could be untruthful despite not having such an incentive</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The same concerns must be at the forefront of the court’s deliberations, even when it does not convict X solely on the basis of Y’s testimony.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As Hadi correctly pointed out, Salleh’s credibility as a witness would be severely diminished once the court had rejected his challenges to the admissibility of his statements, and his claim of agreeing not to traffic in more than 250g of methamphetamine. Nevertheless, this did not mean that Salleh must necessarily have been untruthful in other aspects of his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 That being said, the prong of Salleh’s defence relating to his agreement with Hadi necessarily required Salleh to implicate Hadi with knowledge of the nature of the drugs. Although it was certainly possible for Salleh to have relied solely on the other prong of his defence, which was that he had such an agreement with “Kakak”, Salleh’s defence as he ran it was in fact two-pronged, one relating to Hadi and another relating to “Kakak”. When assessing the credibility of Salleh’s evidence against Hadi, I had to consider whether he had any incentive to lie in the light of the case he was actually running. It was clear that he did have such an incentive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I have found that Salleh was telling the truth about his own involvement in the drug transaction, save that he had no qualms with dealing in capital quantities of methamphetamine (see [50] above). However, this conclusion on its own did not mean that Hadi necessarily had an equal level of knowledge about the drug transactions – Salleh could well have kept him in the dark. I therefore returned to the fact that Salleh attempted to bolster his defence by concocting the existence of an agreement with Hadi to traffic in not more than 250g of methamphetamine. The fact that this defence required Salleh to take the position that Hadi knew the nature of the substance he was transporting made it imprudent to rely on Salleh’s testimony on this point as being corroborative of Hadi’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Although I could not place much weight on Salleh’s testimony against Hadi, the remainder of the evidence I have already considered above nevertheless made it clear that Hadi’s assertion that he thought he was transporting gold and cash could not be believed. Hadi therefore failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption on the balance of probabilities.

</div> There was nothing to contradict these positions. In <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 1 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainudin</span>”) at [65] and [86], the Court of Appeal reiterated that conduct such as the recruitment and remuneration of drug couriers is far removed from the nature and purpose of conveying drugs. This applied squarely to Salleh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Furthermore, it was also clear from the evidence that Salleh did more than merely relay instructions down the chain incidental to the conveyance of the drugs, and instead performed an independent coordinating role between “Kakak” and Hadi. Salleh testified that he was the one who instructed “Kakak” to prepare the drugs for Hadi to collect on 22 July 2015.

</div> As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Zainudin</span> at [86], “if the offender does not merely relay instructions but is in reality the source of those instructions, in the sense that he decided the contents of the instructions,” then he goes beyond being a mere courier. In the present case, the evidence clearly suggested that Salleh played a coordinating role in the drug transaction that went beyond the mere onward relaying of instructions. This was another factor which would also have taken Salleh outside the scope of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The burden of proof is upon the offender himself to show that he falls within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Zainudin</span> at [34]), and Salleh has failed to do so. For the reasons above, I did not accept Salleh’s submission that he was a mere courier. To be clear, the fact that he might potentially have acted as a mere courier <span class="font-italic">if</span> Hadi had been unable to make the delivery on that day did not mean that he ought to be treated as a mere courier given that this was not what in fact happened. Moreover, even in that eventuality, it was questionable whether the evidence would have supported Salleh being a mere courier, as he was the one who instructed “Kakak” to prepare drugs for his collection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the circumstances, although the Prosecution tendered a certificate of substantive assistance in favour of Salleh, I found that he did not qualify for the discretionary sentencing regime under s 33B MDA. I therefore sentenced him to the death penalty.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Winston Cheng Howe Ming, Marcus Foo and Rimplejit Kaur (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Aw Wee Chong Nicholas (Clifford Law LLP), Andy Yeo Kian Wee (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) and Lim Hui Li Debby (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the first accused;<br/>Ragbir Singh S/O Ram Singh Bajwa (Bajwa &amp; Co) and Wong Seow Pin (S P Wong &amp; Co) for the second accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
