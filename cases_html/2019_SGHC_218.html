</div>  It is undisputed that the plaintiff had been <span class="font-italic">unable</span> to ensure the filing of these returns because of a lack of instructions from one of Camford’s foreign clients, Sand Hill Counsel (“Sand Hill”).  Sand Hill is a foreign law firm which had instructed Camford in relation to Spartan Trading and Mango Games.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 From July to October 2015, Mr Natarajan repeatedly wrote to Sand Hill requesting for instructions in relation to the two companies.  The foreign lawyers were asked for the “action plan” in relation to the companies, that is, what was going to be done to finalise the accounts of the companies before taking steps to wind them up or otherwise.

</div>  In December 2015, Mr Natarajan made it clear to Sand Hill that, with recent changes to the law in Singapore, the plaintiff could face repercussions if Singapore filing and regulatory requirements were not complied with.  Mr Natarajan warned that Camford would have little choice but to inform ACRA that the overseas directors and shareholders for Spartan Trading and Mango Games were not contactable.

He could not resign by reason of s 145(1) of Act – Spartan Trading and Mango Games required at least one locally resident director.  With no replacement director having been nominated to take his place, the plaintiff was in a bind.  As he wrote in an email to Sand Hill on 13 September 2016, it was “[b]est…to have [the] client’s concrete action plan because I do not have options at this stage”.

</div>  The focus of s 344G(3) is whether it is <span class="font-italic">just</span> to grant the relief sought and, on the facts, the answer to this was in the affirmative.  On the other hand, s 155A(3) considers the suitability of the plaintiff to act as director, and in this regard, entails an examination of the conduct of the plaintiff in the circumstances leading to his disqualification and his capacity for compliance in the future.  It was contended that all these considerations were not relevant for an application under s 344G(3).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Alternatively, the plaintiff argued that he should be granted relief pursuant to s 155A(3) of the Act.  As a non-executive, nominee director, there was nothing the plaintiff could have done to prevent the defendant’s striking off and his eventual disqualification.  It was argued that the plaintiff’s conduct was not of the type that s 155A was intended to address.  Hence, the court should exercise its powers under s 155A(3) to grant leave to the plaintiff to act as director of the companies in which he was director at the time he was notified of his disqualification.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The intervener’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The intervener argued that s 344G(3) permitted the court to reverse <span class="font-italic">specific</span> effects that had been caused by the company having being struck off the register, and did not operate as a “blanket reversal” of all the consequences of striking off.  Hence, the restoration of the defendant did not automatically remove the premise of the plaintiff’s disqualification under s 155A(1).       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, the intervener was in agreement with the plaintiff that the court has the discretion to grant the plaintiff relief that he sought under s 344G(3), that is, to remove his disqualification under s 155A(1).  Such discretion must be exercised in accordance with considerations of justice.  The disagreement with the plaintiff lay with the interaction between s 344G(3) and s 155A(3).  In essence, the intervener argued that the court should effectively apply the <span class="font-italic">same</span> test in deciding whether to grant relief under s 344G(3) as that for an application under s 155A(3).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Hence, consistent with s 155A(3), the intervener submitted that the discretion under s 344G(3) had to be exercised sparingly, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the applicant was “entirely blameless” in respect of the striking-off.

</div>  Accordingly, it submitted that the plaintiff’s disqualification should remain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The central issue before me was whether it was appropriate for me to exercise my discretion under s 344G(3) of the Act in favour of the plaintiff to place him in the position as director, as if the defendant had never been struck off the register, such that the plaintiff should not be regarded as being disqualified under s 155A(1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 To decide this issue, there are two questions to consider.  The first is the appropriate test to be applied when the court exercises its discretion under s 344G(3).  The second is whether the facts and circumstances of this case justified the exercise of the court’s discretion in the plaintiff’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The remaining issue was whether, alternatively, the court should grant leave to the plaintiff under s 155A(3) so that he could act as a director of the companies set out in his application.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable principles under s 344G(3)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I first determined what principles would apply when the court exercises its discretion under s 344G(3).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Section 344G is a relatively new provision which was introduced, along with ss 344D to 344F, by way of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2014 (No 36 of 2014).  These provisions came into force on 3 January 2016<span class="font-weight-bold">.</span>  Counsel did not cite any local case law which would provide guidance on s 344G’s operation.  Neither was the scope of s 344G’s application specifically discussed during the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014 (“Amendment Bill”) in Parliament.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The language of the section itself thus becomes paramount.  For present purposes, the most relevant provisions are ss 344G(1) and (3).  There are two points to be noted in relation to the language used.  First, s 344G(1) imposes a statutory fiction whereby the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of restoration is that the company is retrospectively treated as having never been struck off in the first place; “the company is <span class="font-italic">to be regarded as having continued in existence as if</span> its name had not be struck off the register” [emphasis added].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, on its plain reading, s 344G(3) gives the court a very broad discretion, confined only by whether it considers it just, to place the company and <span class="font-italic">all other</span> <span class="font-italic">persons</span> in as close a position as they would have been in had the company not been struck off.  The breadth of the language used in that sub-section bears emphasis.  The application there can be made by “<span class="font-italic">any</span> person”, and the court “may <span class="font-italic">give such directions and such orders</span>, <span class="font-italic">as it seems just</span> for placing the company and all other persons <span class="font-italic">in the same position</span> <span class="font-italic">(as nearly as may be) as if the company </span><span class="font-italic">… had not been struck off the register</span>” [emphasis added].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The corresponding English statutory framework is similar.  The wording of s 344G mirrors that of s 1032 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK).  The effect of these sections is the same.  Where a company is restored under s 1032(1), it is treated as though it was never dissolved (<span class="font-italic">Gore-Browne on Companies</span> (Lexis Nexis, 45th Ed, 2019) at para [60(15A)]).  More significantly, under s 1032(3), a court “may give such directions and make such provision <span class="font-italic">as seems just</span>” [emphasis added] to place all other persons in the same position they would have been in had the company not been dissolved or struck off.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The effect of ss 1032(1) and 1032(3) (corresponding to our s 344G(1) and 344G(3)) was discussed by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Joddrell</span> v <span class="font-italic">Peaktone</span><span class="font-italic"> Limited </span>[2013] 1 WLR 784 (“<span class="font-italic">Peaktone</span>”).  Mr Joddrell commenced an action against his former employer, a company, for having suffered noise induced hearing loss which he alleged was attributable to his employment.  At the time Mr Joddrell commenced his action, he did not realise that his former employer had been dissolved and struck-off the register.  Having discovered the striking off, Mr Joddrell then successfully applied for the former employer to be restored.  The former employer argued that the proceedings issued against it whilst it was dissolved were a nullity and could not be retrospectively validated by way of s 1032(1).  Both the court at first instance and the Court of Appeal disagreed.  The language of s 1032(1) clearly reflected an intention by Parliament to allow for the effect of retrospective validation (at [41]–[42]).  It was <span class="font-italic">deemed</span> as if it had never been struck off the register in the first place.  The “sweeping effect” of s 1032(1) was also supported by the language of s 1032(3) which provided a “powerful and illuminating indication of the policy which Parliament had in mind” (at [46]).  Lord Justice Munby added: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[a]s Sir Raymond Evershed observed in <span class="font-italic">Tyman’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Ld v Craven</span> (page 111) of the corresponding provision in section 353 of the 1948 Act, these words </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘seem to me designed, not by way of exposition, to qualify the generality of that which precedes them, <span class="font-italic">but rather as a complement to the general words so as to enable the court </span>(<span class="font-italic">consistently with justice</span>) <span class="font-italic">to achieve the fullest extent the “as-you-were position,” which, according to the ordinary sense of those general words, is prima facie their consequence</span>.’ </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This passage I have cited from <span class="font-italic">Peaktone</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>outlines two key points.  The court’s discretion under s 1032(3) is necessarily general.  This is to achieve, as far as possible, the full effect of a company having been restored to the register.  Further, in exercising its discretion, the court is guided by the objective of restoring all interested parties to their pre-dissolution or pre-striking-off positions, bounded by the constraint only that it must be in the interests of justice to do so.  This limitation was also emphasised by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Davy v Pickering and others</span> [2017] All ER (D) 104 at [39], as per David Richards LJ:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judge was right, in my view, to emphasise that the discretion conferred by section 1032(3) is not unlimited but must be exercised only for its stated purpose (“for placing the company and all other persons in the same position (as nearly as can be) as if the company had not been dissolved or struck off the register”) and, assuming a direction would meet that purpose, only if such direction “seems just”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I adopted the same approach in applying s 344G(3) of the Act.  I found that the discretion conferred by the sub-section, while broad, is not unlimited.  It should be exercised only for the stated purpose of placing, in this case, the plaintiff in the same position (as nearly as can be) as if the defendant had not been struck off the register.  In this case, it is <span class="font-italic">possible</span> for a direction to be made that the plaintiff be treated as not being disqualified under s 155A(1) of the Act as a consequence of the restoration of the defendant to the register.  Both the plaintiff and the intervener were <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> on this.  But, in my judgment, I should <span class="font-italic">not</span> grant such a direction under s 344G(3) <span class="font-italic">unless</span> I am satisfied that it “seems just” for me to do so.  Other than this, I found that there are <span class="font-italic">no</span> other specified limits placed upon the court in the exercise of its discretion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I therefore could not accept the submission by the intervener that the approach to be taken in considering the plaintiff’s application under s 344G(3) in this case is the same as if it were an application under s 155A(3) of the Act.  If the intervener is right, that would immediately shackle the exercise of my discretion such that I can only take into account factors such as the plaintiff’s conduct in the circumstances giving rise to the disqualification, and his capacity for compliance in the future, which both the plaintiff and the intervener submitted are the relevant factors to be taken into account for an application under s 155A(3).  Such an approach would unjustifiably narrow the otherwise broad language in s 344G(3).  I did not think that a sufficiently good reason had been proffered by the intervener as to why I should adopt such a restrictive reading of that sub-section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The intervener argued that a laxer test should not apply just because the plaintiff had chosen to make an application under s 344G(3) rather than under s 155A(3).  Otherwise, it would provide a backdoor way in which the plaintiff could escape the consequences of his disqualification.  It was contended that this could not have been Parliament’s intention.  I could not agree with this submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the first place, there is nothing at the second reading of the Amendment Bill, which ushered in s 344G(3) and re-enacted s 155A(3), that suggests that this was the intent of Parliament.  Quite the contrary, given that both provisions were introduced at the same time, and it was not thought fit to subject the application of s 344G(3) to s 155A(3), one would have surmised that Parliament must have intended for both provisions to operate within their own spheres.  In other words, they apply to different situations.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In my judgment, s 155A(3) provides the general route by which an applicant may seek the court’s leave to be permitted to act as a director even though he has been disqualified under s 155A(1).  In exercising its discretion under s 155A(3), the court will take into account the applicant’s culpability, so to speak, in the circumstances leading to his disqualification and his likelihood of compliance with the statutory requirements for filings going forward.  In this regard, I accepted the submissions of both counsel that these are the predominant factors to consider for an application under s 155A(3).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the other hand, s 344G(3) deals with the specific situation where the Registrar or the court has already determined, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, that a defunct company should be restored to the register.  In this specific context, the court is empowered under s 344G(3) to place all persons in the “as-you-were” position as if the company had never been struck off, provided that it “seems just” to do so.  That would cover the situation of a director who has been disqualified under s 155A(1), and now seeks to reverse that particular consequence that has been caused by the striking off.  That such a scenario would arise must surely have been contemplated by Parliament, which decided, in its wisdom, to allow the two provisions to co-exist, without subjecting one to the other.  Given this, I did not accept the intervener’s submission that the approach under both provisions must be the same, such that when the court decides what seems just in exercising its discretion under s 344G(3), it should consider only the same factors that it would consider had it been an application under s 155A(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I shall briefly address the intervener’s argument that an application under s 344G(3) was the inappropriate means for the plaintiff to seek relief.  It was the intervener’s position that, since the plaintiff was seeking to set aside a disqualification under s 155A, the plaintiff should have relied on the specific procedure set out in that section, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 155A(3).  As I have already explained, ss 155A and 344G each operate within their respective spheres - the latter in the more specific situation where a company has been restored to the register by the court or the Registrar.  As such, the plaintiff is not confined to only seeking leave to act under s 155A(3) given the particular circumstances of this case, where the defendant was restored to the register under s 344E.  In any event, as pointed out by both counsel during the hearing, there was a recent unreported decision, <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Phua Teck Chew</span> (Originating Summons Nos 1176 and 1181 of 2018), where an application by a disqualified director under s 344(5), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 344G(3), to be relieved from his disqualification under s 155A(1) was unopposed by ACRA and granted by the Court.  This shows that the intervener itself accepts that the path to relief from disqualification imposed by s 155A(1) is not confined to s 155A(3) in cases where the defunct company is restored to the register.         </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Should the court’s discretion be exercised? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having ascertained the principles guiding s 344G(3)’s operation, I then considered the appropriateness of exercising the court’s discretion in this case, that is, whether it would be just to grant the relief sought by the plaintiff.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Despite initially arguing that the factors such as plaintiff’s conduct in relation to the striking off of the defendant being irrelevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion under s 344G(3), counsel for the plaintiff did make arguments to the effect that the plaintiff’s actions were not blameworthy and relief under s 344G(3) was justified.  According to counsel, the plaintiff’s predicament was the product of unfortunate circumstances.  By reason of being a nominee director, he was not involved in the day-to-day management of the defendant and did not have the necessary information required to comply with the defendant’s statutory filing requirements.  He could not file the annual returns of the defendant because to do so, he would need to have access to the financial and accounting records of the company, which he did not have.  Thus, he was not in a position to prepare the financial statements of the company and get them audited.  Such audited financial statements had to be filed together with the annual return, as required by Regulation 36(2) of the Companies (Filing of Documents) Regulations (Cap 50, Rg 7, 2005 Rev Ed). The plaintiff did not intentionally avoid his obligations, but this was a case where the directors and members of the defendant had gone incommunicado, and neither he nor Mr Natarajan could not get in touch with them to make the necessary statutory filings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 More significantly, the defendant had since been restored to the register.  ACRA had also acknowledged that the defendant was still carrying on business at the time it was struck off.

</div>  It therefore stands to reason that, had the fact of its carrying on business been brought to the attention of ACRA <span class="font-italic">before</span> the Registrar acted to strike it off, the defendant would not have been struck off the register.  The plaintiff submitted that, in light of the defendant’s restoration, the basis on which the plaintiff was disqualified under s 155A(1) no longer existed.  In the absence of any prejudice, the plaintiff argued that it would be just to allow him to act as a director.  This position was consistent with a logical interpretation of s 344G(3), to give effect to the “as-you-were position”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The intervener submitted that the plaintiff was far from blameless in respect of the defendant’s striking-off.   As a director, the plaintiff had been obliged, under s 197(6) of the Act, to ensure that the defendant complied with its obligation to file its annual return.  He had failed to do so for an extended period of time, from the time of his appointment until the defendant was struck off.  Proper supervision would have prevented this outcome.  The plaintiff had similarly failed to fulfil his duties in respect of Spartan Trading and Mango Games.

It was argued that the plaintiff could have set out the conditions for his appointment, whether by contract or by having them written into the company’s articles, such that he, as the sole resident director could act on behalf of the defendant to, for example, seek a voluntary winding-up.  The plaintiff could also have ensured that he had access to the defendant’s financial records and accounts, so that he could prepare financial statements and hence file annual returns on behalf of the company.  Or, he could have insisted on the defendant having more than one resident director so that he could resign from the company.  Or, he could also have taken up a nominal shareholding in the defendant so that he would have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi</span> to wind it up, if necessary.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Under s 344G(1), the expressly stated effect of a restoration is that the company is regarded as never having been struck off.  This deeming provision sets out what Parliament intended to achieve.  On the facts of this case, the Registrar was satisfied based on evidence of business activity presented to it that the defendant should be restored.  I accepted counsel for the plaintiff’s argument that that it must follow that the Registrar would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have struck off the defendant had the evidence of business activity been presented to it <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the decision to strike off the defendant.  This must be so because, under Regulation 2 of the Companies (Striking Off) Regulations 2015, the ground that must be satisfied before the Registrar can strike off the defendant is that it never carried on a business, or it had ceased to carry on a business.  That being the case, it would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be consistent with achieving the purpose contemplated by s 344G(1) if a direction is made that the directors were put in the position they were in prior to the striking off.  But, as to whether it would be <span class="font-italic">just</span> for the court to make such a direction, the court can and will consider the particular circumstances of the case, and not limit itself to any particular set of factors.  In this regard, I did not accept the plaintiff’s submission that his conduct vis-à-vis the three struck off companies in the lead-up to his disqualification is not relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I first considered the alleged deficiencies in the plaintiff’s conduct in relation to Spartan Trading and Mango Games.  While the plaintiff’s application under s 344G(3) was in relation to the <span class="font-italic">defendant’s</span> restoration, the striking-off of Spartan Trading and Mango Games were also relevant in that they provided a better understanding of the limitations faced by the plaintiff as a nominee director and to show whether the plaintiff was likely to be a recalcitrant in terms of compliance with statutory requirements if he was permitted to continue being appointed as a director in companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff was not involved in the daily operations of Spartan Trading and Mango Games and his functions in the company were largely dependent on instructions from Camford’s clients.  When this was not forthcoming, both Camford and the plaintiff took steps to try to obtain the relevant financial information from Sand Hill and to get the directors to take action to remedy the regulatory lapses (see [16] to [18] above).  In the absence of a substantive response, there was really little more the plaintiff could have done.  As I already noted, he did not have sufficient information about the financial position of the companies to be able to file the annual returns.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The intervener noted that the plaintiff had not produced evidence that similar steps were taken in respect of the defendant.

</div>  Nonetheless, I have the plaintiff’s statements on affidavit that the defendant’s directors and members had gone incommunicado and he himself was not able to get in touch with them.  These were not disputed by the intervener. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I was not persuaded by the intervener’s submissions on the preventative measures which could have been taken by the plaintiff when he took on the role as resident nominee director in 2010.  They do not reflect the reality of corporate legal practice.  For example, I am sure that any client would baulk at the suggestion that a resident nominee director be given some shares so that he might, if the need arises, wind up the company on his own.  The client might also find it surprising, to say the least, if its prospective resident nominee director insists, as a condition of his appointment, on <span class="font-italic">another</span> resident director being appointed.  Also, to argue that a director might exercise his contractual (if any) or statutory right to apply to court for an order that the documents and accounts of the company are to be provided to him may be quite meaningless, if the other directors, who have such information, are uncontactable or outside of Singapore, as in the case here.  Counsel for the intervener himself admitted, in the course of oral arguments, that this last suggestion was more a theoretical solution than a realistic one.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Having considered all the evidence, there was nothing to suggest to me that the plaintiff could have foreseen at the time he took on the appointment as resident nominee director that the defendant’s other directors would become uncontactable.  Effective communication may also have been impeded by the fact that the plaintiff was not the one in direct communication with the directors, since this was the task of Mr Natarajan as the client relationship partner.  This problem was exacerbated after the plaintiff’s resignation from Camford.  He had to mostly depend on Mr Natarajan to follow up on his behalf.  It was also not possible for the plaintiff to extricate himself from the situation by resigning or having the defendant voluntarily struck off.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 All in all, after examining the totality of the plaintiff’s conduct, I was not convinced that his conduct was such that it should inhibit the exercise of the court’s discretion in his favour.  I was not convinced that he will be a recalcitrant defaulter in terms of compliance with statutory filing requirements.  The plaintiff took on the position as a director of the defendant in 2010, well before the new and draconian basis of disqualification under s 155A was even introduced via the Amendment Bill.  Likewise, he had accepted the appointments for Mango Games and Spartan Trading in 2011 and 2012 respectively.  There was no doubt in my mind that, after the coming into force of s 155A, many would be more cautious about taking on resident nominee director appointments in cases where they did not have a pre-existing relationship with the shareholders or know them well.  In this case, given the plaintiff’s appointment as director for all the three companies pre-dated the enactment of s 155A, I was of the view that the plaintiff’s conduct in relation to the three companies had to be viewed a bit more understanding of the proper context, and less with the benefit of hindsight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I also accepted that the plaintiff’s continued disqualification for five years would impose significant hardship, particularly in respect of him being unable to act as a director of his own law practice, Oxon.  On the other hand, there was no third party prejudice in granting the plaintiff relief.  None of the companies for which he had sought leave to act had expressed objections to the plaintiff’s application.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The intervener argued that the need for protection extended beyond these considerations.  It cited <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong (alias Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Chaw Ping) v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1093 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span>”) for the proposition that that the disqualification regime under the Act is “essentially protective in nature” (at [21]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Court in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span> identified two sides to this shield of protection.  On one side is specific protection, which is the need to protect the public from a specific director and the harm he may cause (at [22]).  This is referred to as the “thin definition” of protection.  There is also the more general need to “protect the public from all errant directors by an uncompromising reaffirmation of the expected exemplary standards of corporate governance” (at [23]).  This is the “thick definition” of protection.  Although <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span> was decided prior to the present s 155A’s enactment, the intervener submitted that the Court’s reasoning also applied to a s 155A disqualification.  The objective of a s 155A disqualification is to <span class="font-italic">generally</span> deter directors from adopting a complacent approach in complying with statutory requirements.

</div>  Even if there was little need to protect the public from the plaintiff’s specific actions, his disqualification should stand so as to “deter similar irresponsible conduct” (<span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span> at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Court in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>considered that the “thick” form of protection was to deter “serious lapses in corporate behaviour” (at [24]), particularly involving listed companies (at [23]).  For the reasons above, I did not consider the plaintiff’s conduct as meeting this description.  I found it doubtful that the plaintiff’s disqualification would serve the purpose of general deterrence given that that his situation was rather unique, in that he found himself stuck in his position as a resident nominee director and unable to resign at the time the s 155A disqualification regime was introduced into law.  Also, <span class="font-italic">Ong Chow Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned an appeal against a disqualification under s 154(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, because the director had been convicted of an offence under s 157 of the Act.  This is quite different from the present circumstances.  I therefore rejected the applicability of the thick definition of protection in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I also rejected the intervener’s argument that the legislative purpose(s) of s 155A should solely dictate the exercise of the court’s discretion under s 344G(3).  The intervener submitted that, by setting aside an errant director’s disqualification, the effect of a s 155A disqualification would be reduced from an effective deterrent to a mere procedural inconvenience.

The court’s decision whether to permit an affected director to be relieved of his disqualification turns on the individual facts and justice of the case.  Arguments which focused just on s 155A were not entirely helpful and detracted from the primary objective of achieving the “as-you-were” position that is envisaged by ss 344G(1) and (3).
