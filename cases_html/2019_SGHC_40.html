The first defendant (“Goh”) is a medical doctor providing aesthetic services and skincare-related products and services. He founded the second defendant Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd (“AMP”) in 2008. AMP was in the business of aesthetic services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 25 November 2014, LSI entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Goh (“the SPA”) to purchase 32,049 shares in AMP from Goh for $14,422,050 (“the Sale Price”), purportedly on the basis of certain representations made by Goh that a trade sale of AMP would take place very soon and, if not, that it was intended for AMP to be publicly listed by around June 2015. LSI claimed that, around the same time, it entered into an agreement with AMP whereby AMP would “indemnify” LSI the Sale Price plus 15% annualised internal rate of return (“IRR”) if AMP did not achieve a trade sale or public listing (“IPO”) within 24 months of the execution of the SPA (“the Purported Indemnity”). As neither a trade sale nor an IPO occurred, LSI filed this suit, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to claim against AMP on the Purported Indemnity.

At a dinner in Singapore on 23 October 2014, Goh invited Florence to purchase shares in AMP. LSI’s case is that Goh made various representations to Florence to induce LSI to enter into the SPA and thereafter, Goh and Lee Kin Yun (“Lee”), who was in charge of AMP’s operations, repeated the representations to Florence and Andy. These representations formed the subject of Suit No 1311 of 2015, commenced on 31 December 2015, and my decision was published as <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Pte Ltd v Goh Seng Heng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2019] SGHC 39 (“Suit 1311”). Briefly, the alleged representations were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There would be a trade sale of all the shares in AMP to an important person in Singapore, namely Peter Lim, which was imminent and likely to take place within one month and with a 99% probability of being concluded.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the trade sale did not materialise, Goh intended to list AMP through an IPO on the Singapore Exchange, targeted for completion around March to June 2015 and in any event no later than 24 months after LSI acquired the AMP shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Goh required LSI’s financial support to buy out certain minority investors in AMP with voting rights who could stifle the trade sale or IPO, as he was unable to do so then because his money was “stuck” elsewhere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4  As neither a trade sale nor an IPO took place, LSI filed Suit 1311 and claimed against Goh for misrepresentation. In line with the claims, LSI issued a letter of demand to Goh on 24 November 2015 giving notice that it was electing to rescind the SPA.

</div> Suffice to say, both parties accept that the SPA has come to an end. LSI claimed that it was entitled to and did validly rescind the SPA by virtue of the misrepresentations. Goh claimed that LSI had wrongfully repudiated the SPA as the misrepresentations were not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5  On 2 December 2016 (which was after the 24-month deadline mentioned in the Purported Indemnity), LSI’s counsel wrote to AMP to state that it had formally notified Goh under Clause 4(vii) of the SPA and demanded that Goh repurchase the shares and, if he did not do so, LSI would claim against AMP on a “Guarantee” (in the words of LSI’s counsel) that LSI alleges is the Purported Indemnity.

</div> AMP did not do so and in May 2017 LSI commenced this suit against Goh for a declaration that he re-purchase the shares from LSI at the Sale Price plus 15% IRR totalling $19,073,162, and against AMP for payment to LSI of the same amount under the Purported Indemnity. This suit was heard immediately after Suit 1311 as the facts pertaining to the SPA and the Purported Indemnity were inextricably linked and the plaintiffs were the same in both proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the interim, Goh applied to strike out LSI’s claim on the basis that LSI was precluded from relying on the SPA, which LSI had rescinded and thus brought to an end. AMP also applied to strike out LSI’s claim on the basis that the Purported Indemnity was in effect a guarantee that was embodied in the SPA. As AMP was not a party to the SPA, LSI could not claim on the guarantee against AMP. I found that LSI had made an unequivocal election to rescind the SPA. Given that any agreement with Goh was embodied in the SPA, it was no longer open to LSI to enforce a claim against him. I therefore granted Goh’s application. However, it remained open to LSI to show that an agreement between LSI and AMP continued to exist <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the SPA. Hence, the trial proceeded only between LSI and AMP on the Purported Indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">LSI’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 LSI’s evidence in relation to how Florence and Andy came to know Goh and others in AMP, the representations made by Goh, and the negotiations on the terms of the SPA and the various terms that speak of the Purported Indemnity have been set out in Suit 1311 and my decision therein, and I will not repeat these. Counsel for LSI and AMP have no objections to allowing the evidence given by Florence and Andy in Suit 1311 to apply in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At the outset it is important to point out that in an indemnity the indemnitor’s liability is undertaken primarily to his obligations and original to the creditor. In contrast, under a guarantee, the guarantor’s liability is essentially secondary to the principal. Further, an indemnity need not be evidenced in writing, unlike a contract of guarantee pursuant to s 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the CLA”). LSI accepted that if the written and signed SPA had been rescinded, then any indemnity or guarantee <span class="font-italic">within</span> the SPA could no longer operate to bind those parties to the indemnity or guarantee.

</div> This separate contract of indemnity survived the rescission and did not need to be evidenced in writing. Alternatively, the Purported Indemnity was an independent contract of guarantee, whereby AMP would be liable to pay LSI (the Sale Price plus IRR totalling $19,073,162) if Goh failed or refused to repurchase the shares.

On its primary case, LSI claimed that the Purported Indemnity was entered into between LSI and AMP “on or about” 25 November 2014, whereby AMP agreed to indemnify LSI the Sale Price plus 15% IRR if AMP did not achieve a trade sale or an IPO within 24 months of executing the SPA. LSI claimed that the Purported Indemnity was “evidenced in writing” by the following:

</div>. Florence explained that the deal to buy Goh’s AMP shares had to be completed quickly as Goh had informed her that a trade sale was imminent and that he needed her and Andy’s money to buy out the minority investors. Andy thus asked for an assurance that there would be a “guarantee” or minimum return on their investment should the trade sale or IPO not occur, hence the “guarantee” for their capital (the Sale Price) plus the 15% IRR to protect their investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On LSI’s alternative case, the Purported Indemnity was a contract of guarantee which existed outside the SPA and on the same terms as in the Purported Indemnity, in that AMP would guarantee Goh’s default to the sum of the Sale Price plus 15% IRR. It should be noted however, that in LSI’s Closing Submissions, it took the position that the Purported Indemnity was in the nature of an indemnity and not a guarantee.

To be clear, this is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a finding that the Purported Indemnity between LSI and AMP existed. Rather, assuming the Purported Indemnity existed, I considered what it terms would have been. The SPA expressly defined the obligations of the “Seller” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Goh) and the “Company” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, AMP) regarding the shares that Goh was selling to LSI and what would happen if there was no trade sale or IPO.

</div> I reject LSI’s claim. The Additional Term was not pleaded or mentioned in Florence’s or Andy’s AEICs, and not found in any of the correspondence, documents or draft term sheets and SPAs discussed prior to the signing of the SPA. On the contrary, the Additional Term is at odds with clause 4(vii) of the SPA (which LSI claimed was a term of the Purported Indemnity). Although LSI relied on the part which states that “[t]he principle [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and the IRR return are guaranteed by [AMP]”, clause 4(vii) must be read in totality. The clause, which was requested by Andy during the negotiations of the SPA,

Hence, the words stating that “[t]he principle [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and the IRR return are guaranteed by [AMP]”, located between the parts of the clause detailing the share buy-back or buy-out mechanism, must be read in context of clause 4(vii), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that LSI’s obtainment of the Sale Price and IRR was contingent on the sale of the shares back to Goh or to AMP. I will return to the construction of clause 4(vii) when determining the nature of the Purported Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Indeed, Andy equivocated on whether LSI would have to return the shares to avail itself of the indemnity, at times accepting it would have to and at times disagreeing.

</div> That he could not give clear evidence about such a material term as the mechanism of indemnification fortifies my view that no such term existed. In fact, Andy subsequently admitted that if LSI called on the Purported Indemnity against AMP, LSI would have to give up the shares as it could not benefit twice. Andy also agreed that it would be absurd for LSI to be able to claim the return of the Sale Price and IRR while retaining the shares.

There is no property in a witness, and Mr Singh SC rightly conceded that it was open to LSI to call Goh and Lee if its case was that their evidence would support the existence of an independent agreement. This is all the more so here since Goh was no longer a director of AMP.

Andy’s testimony bore this out. Andy agreed that even when negotiating the indemnity or guarantee with Lee (see [27] above), he was looking at the SPA.

</div> In other words, the indemnity agreement was concluded at that point in time.

As Andy indicated to Lee, “please find the [document] without old term iii. Once you are OK with it, Florence will sign and mail it to you”. Andy was clearly referring to the Purported Indemnity in the context of the negotiated document (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SPA to be signed) and it was only when such a term had been clarified within the draft SPA that he would advise Florence to sign it. Hence, when the SPA was eventually signed with LSI as a party, it was apparent that any “indemnity” was only extant within the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether AMP had agreed to be bound by a separate and independent Purported Indemnity agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39  I proceed to deal with LSI’s assertion that AMP had agreed to be bound by a separate and independent Purported Indemnity agreement. I deal first with the AMP Directors’ Resolution dated 25 November 2014 (“the Directors’ Resolution”).

</div> It is unclear from the evidence in this suit whether the Directors’ Resolution was signed before or after the SPA (since both documents bore the same date). Either way, the Directors’ Resolution did not support LSI’s case that a separate and independent indemnity or guarantee agreement had been concluded. On the contrary, the Directors’ Resolution referred to a <span class="font-italic">guarantee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>“<span class="font-italic">as stated in the </span><span class="font-italic">SPA</span>” and did not mention any guarantee or indemnity which was separate from an SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Mr Singh SC then suggested that AMP had not led any evidence to refute LSI’s assertion on the Directors’ Resolution.

</div> Nelson, who was a director of AMP by the time Suit 111 was filed, explained that after AMP discovered Goh’s “wrongdoings” it decided to protect itself against all contingencies and pursue Goh for all possible wrongdoings. This was because AMP, which had new directors by then, did not know if a valid guarantee had indeed been given by the previous AMP board to LSI.

The SPA, which was between LSI and Goh, contained the terms of the Purported Indemnity and was the <span class="font-italic">only</span> agreement ultimately concluded. Thus LSI could not rely on the Purported Indemnity vis-à-vis AMP as AMP was not a party to the SPA and in any event LSI had brought the SPA to an end by its act of rescission.

Hence, when LSI executed the SPA, Florence and Andy would have noticed that Goh was signing “as seller” (in his personal capacity). Unlike the earlier draft term sheets in which Goh was stated (in the signature column) “as seller and on behalf of [AMP]”, the draft SPAs, of which there were a few versions before the final version being executed, all showed Goh (in the signature column) “as seller”. It is also not LSI’s case that Goh was representing AMP to execute <span class="font-italic">the SPA</span>.

Despite the importance of this indemnity or guarantee to Andy and Florence and ample documentation on this matter, they could not state with certainty what the clauses of this separate agreement were until Andy was cross-examined in court, or when this separate agreement was concluded. It is clear from the correspondence and conduct of the individuals involved that they were negotiating the terms of the SPA throughout. It is also clear that the terms of the indemnity or guarantee (which were to protect LSI’s investment money) were negotiated by Andy as part and parcel of the terms of the SPA, and there is no evidence that the negotiations were for a separate and independent indemnity or guarantee agreement. Pertinently, all the terms of the Purported Indemnity (which Andy claimed to be as reflected in clauses 4(ii), (iv), (v), (vii) and (viii) of the SPA) are the exact same terms found in clause 4 of the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Nature of the Purported Indemnity clauses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I have found that the terms of the Purported Indemnity are part and parcel of the SPA.

</div> As I explained above (at [8]), the key difference is that a guarantor’s liability is collateral and dependent upon the liability and default of the principal debtor, whereas an indemnitor’s liability is original and independent. As with all contracts, it is a matter of construction in each case whether a guarantee or indemnity has been given (<span class="font-italic">PT Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia v Kristle Trading Ltd </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 689 at [50] and [52]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Construction of the Purported Indemnity terms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I first consider the relevant terms of the SPA. The SPA was, understandably, not well-drafted as it was prepared by lay persons within a short period of time. The operative part of the SPA (which deals with the event of the non-occurrence of a trade sale or an IPO) is clause 4(vii). In my view, this clause, when taken with the other clauses in the SPA, is to be read as imposing the following rights and obligations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) LSI has the option to sell the shares back to Goh, with Goh paying for the shares at the Sale Price plus IRR (“the First Scenario”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If LSI exercises the option to sell the shares back to Goh and Goh does not pay for them (either fully or in part), AMP is obliged to make up the difference, since “[t]he principle [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and the IRR return are guaranteed by [AMP]”. Likewise, if Goh refuses to accept and pay for the shares, AMP is obliged to pay LSI for them (“the Second Scenario”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) LSI has the option to sell the shares to AMP, in which case AMP has to pay the Sale Price plus IRR (“the Third Scenario”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In court, Andy agreed to the above construction of clause 4(vii).

In the Second Scenario, LSI would be undertaking a secondary obligation as guarantor, when Goh who is principally liable to repurchase the shares at the Sale Price and IRR fails to do so or to pay for them (whether in full or in part). Andy agreed that this would be the effect if LSI first made a claim against Goh.

</div> He also agreed that regardless of whomever LSI elected to sell the shares to, LSI could not make overlapping claims against both Goh and AMP. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that AMP was not a party to the SPA and, even if it were, LSI had acted to rescind the SPA and the SPA had been terminated, thus any guarantee within it would fall away (see also [46]–[48] above). I would also add that even if a guarantee with AMP somehow existed outside of the SPA, that the obligation of Goh (as the purported principal) within the SPA had come to an end meant that any secondary obligation undertaken by AMP would similarly fall away. A guarantor is generally liable to the same extent that the principal is liable to the creditor. There is usually no liability on the part of the guarantor if the underlying obligation is void, unenforceable, or the underlying obligation ceases to exist: see <span class="font-italic">American Home Assurance</span><span class="font-italic"> Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 at [40].

</div> This scenario would, at first blush, make AMP’s liability original and independent and hence support the characterisation of the Purported Indemnity as an indemnity. Even so, the fact remains that AMP was never a party to the SPA.

</div> I agree with AMP’s counsel (Mr Sreenivasan SC) that LSI’s lawyers,<span class="font-italic"> </span>having been appraised all of the facts and given the documents, would have reflected in the AMP Demand Letter (which they drafted and no doubt based on their advice) an “indemnity” rather than a “guarantee” which LSI could call upon vis-à-vis AMP, if the Purported Indemnity was alleged to be and treated as an indemnity by LSI.

</div> The inference was that even until 2 December 2016, well after the circumstances giving rise to the Purported Indemnity had occurred, Florence and Andy continued to apprehend the Purported Indemnity to be a guarantee. This was apparent not merely from the use of the word “guarantee” throughout, but from LSI’s description and treatment of the <span class="font-italic">mechani</span><span class="font-italic">sm</span> for its claim against AMP and Goh. The tenor of the AMP and Goh Demand Letters (which LSI’s lawyers drafted) showed that LSI treated Goh as the principal in the context of a guarantee and that it was only in the event that Goh did not honour the terms of clause 4(vii) to buy the shares that LSI would make a claim against AMP, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that LSI had to call on Goh before it could turn to AMP.  On the stand, Andy claimed that LSI was acting out of kindness by giving Goh an opportunity to repurchase the shares (as per clause 4(vii)) and only if he failed to do so would LSI look to AMP. I disbelieve Andy’s claim as he subsequently admitted that he had in any event a right under clause 4(vii) to make a claim against Goh.

I infer that when LSI’s lawyers received the 6 January 2017 letter, in which they were informed that a guarantee had to be reduced in writing and were requested to produce a copy of that guarantee, LSI changed its position to assert that there was a separate and independent agreement of indemnity or guarantee when it realised by this time that it had acted to rescind the SPA and there were no other written agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, Andy’s and Florence’s testimonies showed that they did not believe the Purported Indemnity to be a true indemnity at the material time.

Even if clause 4(vii) was intended to partially create an indemnity (in the Third Scenario at [51(c)] above), I have found there to be no separate and independent indemnity or guarantee agreement outside of the SPA. Hence, whether the Purported Indemnity was an indemnity or guarantee and whether or not Goh and/or Lee had authority to represent AMP, AMP was also not a party to the SPA and could not be held liable on the Purported Indemnity encapsulated within the SPA. In any event, as LSI has acted to rescind the SPA, it can no longer rely on the Purported Indemnity which was within the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I have already found there to be no independent contract of indemnity or guarantee outside the SPA. Hence, I need not consider whether the formal requirements for a contract of guarantee (if one existed independent of the SPA) have been complied with pursuant to s 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CLA. In any event, although LSI relied on <span class="font-italic">Joseph Mathew v Singh Chiranjeev</span> [2010] 1 SLR 338 at [27], where the Court of Appeal held that s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA (in the context of an option to purchase a property) could be satisfied by the joinder of several documents, I find that LSI could not adequately demonstrate <span class="font-italic">which</span> of the documents it was relying on. If at all, the evidence points towards the Purported Indemnity terms being encapsulated in the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As to LSI’s assertion that AMP is precluded from relying on s 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CLA by virtue of part-performance or estoppel (assuming there was a separate contract of guarantee), I will deal with it briefly for completeness although the point is moot. In relation to part performance, LSI claimed that AMP had induced it to enter the SPA without conducting due diligence of AMP by representing that the guarantee would be legally enforceable. LSI then relied detrimentally on this representation by omitting to conduct due diligence and making payment for the AMP shares.

</div> However, in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span> the court at [33] stated that “the acts relied upon as evidence of part performance of a purported oral contract must unequivocally and of themselves point to the contract as alleged”. In the present case, there was no part performance pointing unequivocally toward an independent contractual guarantee. Quite the contrary, Andy had stated that throughout the correspondence with Lee he was looking at the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 LSI’s reliance on estoppel would fail for similar reasons. AMP referred to <span class="font-italic">Actionstrength Ltd v International Glass Engineering IN.GL.EN SpA and another</span> [2003] 2 AC 541. That case concerned the plaintiff (“P”) supplying labour to the first defendant (“D1”) who had contracted to build a factory for the second defendant (“D2”). D1 fell into arrears of payment to P, and D2 and P allegedly orally agreed that in consideration of P not withdrawing its labour from the site, D2 would provide a guarantee to meet D1’s payment obligations to P if D1 failed to do so. In a striking out application, D2 relied on s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (c 3) (UK), which required any such agreement to be in writing. P alleged that D2 was estopped from relying on the UK Statute of Frauds as D2’s promise had encouraged P to remain on site to its detriment. Lord Bingham outlined three requirements (at [8]) for estoppel to prevent a party from disputing the assumed effect of a guarantee, namely: (a) there had to be an assumption made by the plaintiff; (b) the defendant had to induce or encourage the making of that assumption; and (c) in all the circumstances, it was unconscionable for the defendant to rely on the requirement of writing. It was found (at [9]) that the mere fact of D2 making an oral guarantee was insufficient inducement for the purposes of founding the estoppel. There was no representation by D2 to P that it would honour the guarantee <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the absence of writing, or that it would confirm the agreement in writing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Although LSI claimed that it had relied on AMP’s representations that the guarantee would be enforceable, I could not discern any representation that such a guarantee could be enforceable even if it were not confirmed in writing. Indeed, my finding was that any envisaged guarantees during the negotiations were those to be concluded in the SPA. Even accepting that LSI had relied on the assumption of an enforceable guarantee, it was questionable whether it was <span class="font-italic">AMP </span>who had induced LSI’s representatives into such an independent guarantee (see also [41]–[42] above). After all, it was <span class="font-italic">Goh’s</span> shares that were being sold to LSI and for which <span class="font-italic">Goh</span> derived the benefit of the share purchase. Additionally, in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK and another appeal</span> [2018] SGCA 83 at [142], the Court of Appeal has clarified (in a case involving the setting aside of an agreement) that the <span class="font-italic">narrow</span> doctrine of unconscionability applies in Singapore. To succeed, LSI had to show that it was suffering from some form of infirmity that AMP exploited in procuring the transaction. This was not apparent from the facts even putting aside that AMP was not a party to the SPA. To the contrary, the transaction was negotiated between the individuals in a commercial setting attempting to ensure their interests were protected.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In conclusion, I summarise my findings above. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The terms of the Purported Indemnity are encapsulated in clauses 4(ii), (iv), (v), (vii) and (viii) of the SPA and there is no Additional Term as alleged by LSI.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Purported Indemnity is, on the proper analysis, a guarantee. Even if clause 4(vii) provided partly for an indemnity in that LSI could look directly to AMP to purchase the shares and pay LSI the Sale Price plus IRR, any such agreement was part and parcel of the SPA. There is no separate contract of indemnity or guarantee as LSI claimed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if the SPA (which includes clause 4) purports to provide a right to LSI to claim against AMP for the Sale Price plus IRR, LSI cannot rely on the SPA to enforce such a right against AMP because AMP is not a party to the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Even if AMP were a party to the SPA, LSI would in any event not be able to claim on the Purported Indemnity because the SPA (which the Purported Indemnity is a part of) has come to an end by LSI’s act of rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At the end of the day, even if Andy and Florence may have intended to make AMP a guarantor or indemnitor for the investment money when LSI bought the shares from Goh, the fact remains that when LSI signed the SPA which contained the clauses pertaining to AMP’s obligations, it knew that the counterparty was Goh. LSI has also acted to rescind the SPA, terminating any obligations within it, including any indemnity or guarantee. Having subsequently realised this, LSI has now mounted a case on the basis that there was a separate agreement entered into between it and AMP, which was outside the SPA. I have found that LSI has not been able to prove this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Accordingly, I dismiss LSI’s claim with costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Harpreet Singh Nehal SC, Keith Han, and Tan Tian Yi <br/>(Cavenagh Law LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Narayanan Sreenivasan SC, Rajaram Muralli Raja, Ivan Qiu, <br/>and Kyle Gabriel Peters (Straits Law Practice LLC) <br/>for the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
