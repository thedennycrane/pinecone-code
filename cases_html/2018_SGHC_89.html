He then instructed her to go into the bedroom. Based on BMR’s prior conduct, the Victim understood this to be a signal that he wanted to have sex with her. She complied with his instructions out of fear that he would punish her if she did not do so. Once in the room, BMR instructed the Victim to undress and lie on the mattress. He put on a condom, penetrated her vagina with his penis, and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her for the next two to three minutes before ejaculating into the condom.

On the other hand, the Prosecution did not specifically address the question of how these Additional Facts bore a sufficient nexus to the 4th, the 5th, or the 6th charge. Further, the SOF did not specify whether the acts or events forming the Additional Facts took place before or after the offences disclosed in the charges (save for the 6th charge, since it appeared to be the very last instance of BMR’s sexual abuse). For these reasons, I gave no weight to the Additional Facts even though BMR had admitted to them without qualification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I would add that if the Additional Facts were meant to give a general background to the offences for which BMR was charged, they were unnecessary.

</div> As for Stage 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework, the Prosecution submitted that the only mitigating factor was that the accused pleaded guilty, thus sparing the Victim from having to go through the pain of testifying in court.

Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of<span class="font-italic"> </span>sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually </span>be imposed for an offence with those<span class="font-italic"> </span>features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely<span class="font-italic"> </span>where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an<span class="font-italic"> </span>“indicative starting point”. In exceptional cases, the court may decide<span class="font-italic"> </span>on an indicative starting point which falls outside the prescribed range, although cogent reasons should be given for such a decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The sentencing bands prescribe ranges of sentences which would be appropriate for contested cases and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness which attract sentences of 10–13 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Such cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2 comprises cases of rape of a higher level of seriousness which attract sentences of 13–17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors (such as those listed at [44] above).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3 comprises cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They should attract sentences of between 17–20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. One of the factors which the court should consider at this stage is the value of a plea of guilt (if any). The mitigating value of a plea of guilt should be assessed in terms of (i) the extent to which it is a signal of remorse; (ii) the savings in judicial resources; and (iii) the extent to which it spared the victim the ordeal of testifying. Thus under our proposed framework, while for the first step an uncontested case will proceed in the same way as a contested case, it is at the second step that the appropriate discount will be accorded by the court for the plea of guilt by the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The court should clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This applies <span class="font-italic">both </span>at the second step of the analysis, when the court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point <span class="font-italic">and </span>at the end of the sentencing process, when the court adjusts the sentence on account of the totality principle. In this regard, we would add one further caveat. In a case where the offender faces two or more charges, and the court is required to order one or more sentences to run consecutively, the court can, if it thinks it necessary, further calibrate the individual sentence to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive. When it does so, the court should explain itself so that the individual sentence imposed will not be misunderstood.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factors relating to the first stage of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> framework</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The offence-specific aggravating factors  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I found that various aggravating factors identified by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> were present in this case, and these factors brought it within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework.  </div><div class="HN-Coram text-justify">26 First, BMR had abused his position of trust vis-à-vis the victim. As the stepfather of a child her age, he was clearly in a position of trust. The Victim and her family were also financially dependent on his income stream. Yet, he blatantly abused that position to compel the Victim to satisfy his sexual desires, and to remain silent about his wicked acts. On the pretext of being a concerned stepfather who wanted to speak to his stepdaughter about a family dispute, he brought the Victim home alone to isolate her from the rest of her family on 3 March 2015 (in relation to the 6th charge).

</div>
</div>
</div> BMR did so in order to be able to violate her with impunity and to escape detection. Consequently, the Victim found herself in no position to adequately resist or even expose BMR’s violations. As the CA observed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(b)]: “[w]hen such an offender commits rape, there is a dual wrong: not only has he committed a serious crime, he has also violated the trust placed in him by society and by the victim”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Second, the Victim in this case was especially vulnerable due to her age. BMR had started sexually abusing her when she was only eight years old, and first raped her when she was between eight and nine years old.    </div><div class="HN-Coram text-justify">28 Third, the Victim did not <span class="font-italic">factually</span> consent to having sex with BMR. Section 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC stipulates that it is an offence for a man to penetrate the vagina of a woman under 14 years of age with <span class="font-italic">or</span> without her consent (“statutory rape”). The punishment for statutory rape is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years and the offender shall also be liable to fine or to caning: s 375(2) of the PC. However, where the rape was committed on a victim below the age of 14 years without her consent, s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) stipulates a minimum of 8 years and a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment, and at least 12 strokes of the cane. The absence of consent by a victim below the age of 14 is an aggravating factor for the purpose of deciding the appropriate sentence under the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework, and the CA has clarified at [51] of the judgment that while “statutory rape falls within the upper end of Band 1”, “aggravated statutory rape (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without consent) is different and clearly falls within Band 2”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Fourth, BMR had acted with deliberation and premeditation. BMR had taken steps to isolate the Victim from the rest of the family or wait for an opportune timing before sexually violating her. Further, his threat to divorce M was also another instance of deliberation as he knowingly exploited the Victim’s fear that the family could not cope financially without his income stream.

</div> These deliberate and premeditated acts were meant to, and did in fact, deny the Victim of her will to resist, allowing BMR to sexually violate the Victim multiple times and successfully escape detection for more than five years.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Fifth, BMR had repeatedly violated the Victim over a relatively long duration of time. In this case, the total duration of his offences (including the TIC charges) spanned at least four years, though the actual frequency of BMR’s sexual violations was not clear due to shortcomings in the Victim’s memory.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Sixth, I also took into account the fact that BMR’s sexual violations of the Victim was not limited to rape, but also included digital penetration of her vagina, penile penetration of her mouth, and outraging her modesty. These acts were committed immediately before BMR raped the Victim in respect of the 4th and 5th charges, and were also the subject of the TIC charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the harm caused to the Victim by the rapes was an aggravating factor.

However, the point that the CA was making was that where there are especially serious physical or mental effects on the victim such as pregnancy, the transmission of a serious disease or psychiatric illness, that is a serious aggravating factor. The physical and emotional harm caused to a victim of rape is what already causes the offence to be a very serious one. However, that harm should not then be used as an aggravating factor as that would be giving that harm double weight. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prose</span><span class="font-italic">cutor v Ong Soon Heng </span>[2018] SGHC 58, Aedit Abdullah J said, at [154], that there needs to be a relatively severe state of psychological or physical harm for the court to find that there is an additional offence-specific aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Prosecution cited <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Murugesan </span>[2005] SGHC 160, <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Stuckless</span> (1998) 127 CCC (3d) 225 and <span class="font-italic">AQW v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 4 SLR 150 in support of their submission that the harm caused in this case was an aggravating factor. Essentially, these cases reiterate the grave impact, whether physical or emotional, that invariably result from rape. However, they are not authorities for the proposition that the grave impact is an aggravating factor for the already very serious charge of rape. Although I recognised that the present offences had grave effects on the Victim’s well-being, it did not cause the type of harm that the CA had in mind for the purposes of this factor. Tests by KK Hospital for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy were, fortunately, negative.

</div> The Victim’s insecurity, flashbacks and difficulty in making eye contact with M did not, in my view, amount to an aggravating factor. This by no means downplayed the gravity of the harm caused to the Victim as a consequence of the rapes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentencing range within Band 2  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Prosecution submitted that this case fell within the upper reaches of Band 2, thus attracting a sentence from 16 to 17 years of imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each offence. They cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BNN </span>[2014] SGHC 7 (“<span class="font-italic">BNN</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1057 (“<span class="font-italic">AOM</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AHB </span>[2010] SGHC 138 (“<span class="font-italic">AHB</span>”) in support of their submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">BNN</span>, the offender was sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment with 17 strokes of the cane and 15 years of imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane respectively for two of the rape charges to which he had pleaded guilty. The aggregate sentence was thus 32 years of imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. In that case, the offender, who was the victim’s stepfather, had started to sexually abuse her when she was 11 years old, and first raped her forcibly when she was 14. This was accompanied by a sustained pattern of serious physical abuse against the victim and her sister. On the first occasion of rape, the offender had pulled the victim out of the toilet while she was bathing, licked her vagina, and groped her breasts before proceeding to rape her without a condom and ejaculate in her. I was of the view that <span class="font-italic">BNN</span> could be distinguished from the facts of the present case. Firstly, the offender in <span class="font-italic">BNN</span> was convicted of seven charges with 11 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The charges included wantonly causing hurt to the victim and her sister. Secondly, the offender in <span class="font-italic">BNN</span>, who had kicked, punched and slammed the victim against hard surfaces such as the floor and a car door,<span class="font-italic"> </span>was also more violent than BMR in this case. Secondly, there were two victims in <span class="font-italic">BNN</span> and both were the offender’s stepdaughters, even though only one was the victim of sexual abuse. Furthermore, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> said that <span class="font-italic">BNN </span>fell within the middle to upper range of Band 2 (at [55]) rather than the upper range of Band 2.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">AOM</span>, the court sentenced the offender to 13 years of imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane for each of the three statutory rape charges that he had pleaded guilty to, with an aggregate sentence of 26 years of imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. The victim was 12 years old when the first rape took place. Although the victim had contracted chlamydia as a result, Steven Chong J (as he then was) nevertheless gave a sentencing discount (from the then-benchmark of 15 years’ imprisonment per charge) on account of the victim being spared from having to relive the ordeal by testifying in court. Although the CA in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> cited <span class="font-italic">AOM</span> as a case which would fall within the upper end of Band 2, this was partly because the victim there had contracted a sexually transmitted disease.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">AHB</span>, I sentenced the offender to 18 years of imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane for three rapes to which he had pleaded guilty, with an aggregate sentence of 36 years of imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. The offender had already been imprisoned for outraging the modesty of his biological daughter. Upon his release, he continued to outrage her modesty before raping her when she was 14 years old. The victim became pregnant as a result. She delivered the child, but had to give the child up for adoption. The offender showed no concern when told of the pregnancy by the victim, and instead forced her to perform oral sex on him. <span class="font-italic">AHB</span> can be distinguished from the facts of the present case because there the victim became pregnant as a result of the rape. This pregnancy was a feature mentioned by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (at [56]) for placing <span class="font-italic">AHB</span> at the high end of Band 2.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the reasons given above, I was of the view that the present case fell within the middle to upper reaches of Band 2, thus attracting a starting point of 15 to 16 years of imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each offence at Stage 1.              </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factors relating to the second stage of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Terence Ng</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> framework</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In contrast to the offence-specific factors accounted for under Stage 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework, Stage 2 deals with offender-specific factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Prosecution urged me to treat the presence of the 1st to 3rd charges (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the TIC charges) as an aggravating factor in this case.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence at para 47. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> They cited the CA’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (at [64(a)]) that a court will normally increase an offender’s sentence where the TIC charges are of a similar nature. I rejected this submission. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the CA recognised that “a court is not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences”. On the facts of that case, the CA took the view (at [91]) that the uplift resulting from the offender’s TIC charges cancelled out any sentencing discount attributable to his guilty plea. In my view, a court should not increase a rape offender’s sentence merely because there are TIC charges if the factors pertaining to those charges have already been accounted for in Stage 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework. Otherwise those factors would be given double weight. Here, I took the view that the facts pertaining to the TIC charges showed that the sexual violations had taken place over a long duration and I took this into account as an aggravating factor at Stage 1. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the CA did not take into account the facts surrounding the TIC charges at Stage 1. Instead, the CA took into account the TIC charges at Stage 2 in finding that they cancelled out any discount attributable to the offender’s guilty plea.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I come now to the points raised in BMR’s mitigation plea (see [23] above). His allegation that he had to support his elderly and ill mother financially and physically carried little weight. First, there was no elaboration on whether there were others who could care for his mother. Secondly and more importantly, if such a reason were to be given much weight, it would be abused. The gravity of the 4th, 5th, and 6th charges and the TIC charges were too serious for such a reason to be given much weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for BMR’s allegation that he was not aware that the consequences of his action would lead to his incarceration, it suggested that his regret stemmed more from having been caught than from genuine remorse for his actions. In any event, I did not accept his suggestion that he was not aware of the consequences. Any adult must have an idea that committing such acts amounted to serious criminal offences and incarceration is the price to pay for such offences. There was no suggestion that BMR had any mental deficiency that prevented him from appreciating this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As for BMR’s professed concern and love for his daughters, it was not clear whether he distinguished between his biological daughters and stepdaughters. If he did not, his professed love and concern would be ironic bearing in mind that the Victim was his stepdaughter. If he had only meant to refer to his biological daughters, that still did not help him much as the Victim was entitled, as his stepdaughter, to his love and protection but was instead victimised by him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As for his regret for his mistakes, BMR clearly did not show any remorse for his actions. In his first police statement recorded on 17 March 2015, BMR claimed that the Victim had fabricated her allegations as an excuse to move out and stay with Nanny.

</div> In his interviews with a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health on 1 and 21 September 2015, he repeated the claim that the Victim had undressed in front of him, had exposed her undergarments or body when asleep, and had consented to having sex with him when he requested for it.

That said, I was of the view that a sentencing discount should nevertheless still be given to the offender for his guilty plea. This was because it spared the Victim the ordeal of having to testify at trial and relive the terrible events. As the CA recognised in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (at [68], citing<span class="font-italic"> Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Kar Meng v PP</span> [2017] 2 SLR 68), offenders who plead guilty to sexual offences “ought ordinarily to be given at least <span class="font-italic">some </span>credit for having spared the victim additional suffering” [emphasis in original]. Despite the offender’s evident lack of remorse in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the CA nonetheless accepted (at [90]) that a sentencing discount should be given “in recognition of the fact that [his] decision to plead guilty had spared the minor the ordeal of having to testify”. Although that discount was cancelled out by the effect of the TIC charges in that case, the TIC charges in the present case did not factor into Stage 2 of the sentencing exercise for the reasons I have given above at [40].   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In view of this mitigating factor, I was of the view that although this case fell within the middle to upper ranges of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, sentences of 15 to 16 years of imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane for each offence), a sentence of 14 years of imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane was appropriate for each of the 4th, 5th and 6th charges.
