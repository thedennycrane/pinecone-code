Both sides, unfortunately, suffered losses as a result of the failed investment, and the investor now seeks redress against his agents. The dispute presents interesting questions on the law of agency, specifically the duties owed by agents. As such, I have provided in the course of this Judgment a proposed framework for dealing with these issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff, Tonny Permana, is an Indonesian businessman and investor.

</div> The second defendant, Gerald Yeo, is the director and sole shareholder of the first defendant. It is undisputed that the first defendant acted, at all material times, through the second defendant. I will hence refer to them collectively at the relevant portions of this Judgment as “the defendants”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The dispute between the parties has its genesis in a project undertaken by Midas Landmark Sdn Bhd (which was later renamed CHN Commodity Trade Centre Sdn Bhd – for ease of reference, I refer to the company simply as “Midas”). Midas sought to purchase and renovate an existing shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (“the Mall”) – I refer to this endeavour as the “Chinamall Project”. Midas required funding for this project, and the defendants were aware of this. Thus, the defendants raised to the plaintiff the prospect of investing in the Chinamall Project.

</div> The plaintiff agreed to make, and did make, an investment of about US$1.6m in the Chinamall Project. In the months that followed, the defendants continued to liaise with the plaintiff over the status of his investment, and several changes were made to the structure of the plaintiff’s investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 However, the investment did not bear fruit. The management of the Mall obtained a winding up order against Midas in the Malaysian courts on 4 December 2015.

</div> Despite the efforts of the defendants to appeal against the order, the winding up and liquidation of Midas proceeded. No dividends were paid out to the plaintiff, and he was not repaid the US$1.6m he invested in the Chinamall Project. The plaintiff also failed to recover the sum of US$1.6m from Midas’ insolvency, because the defendants were unsuccessful in their attempts to recover the sum <span class="font-italic">qua</span> creditor in the insolvency proceedings. The plaintiff now claims from the defendants, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the value of his investment.

</div> The plaintiff alleges that such conduct by the defendants, along with the correspondence and dealings between them in the course of the investment, constituted (a) fraudulent misrepresentation; (b) misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“Misrepresentation Act”); (c) a breach of fiduciary duties; (d) a breach of “duties as agent”; (e) negligence; and/or (f) dishonest assistance. The first five allegations pertain to both defendants, while the allegation of dishonest assistance pertains solely to the second defendant.

However, Mr Tan Chong Whatt claimed that Midas would be able to renegotiate and revise the consideration to RM100m.

Of the remaining, the Tans envisaged RM50m to be raised “from a consortium of investors procured by [the first defendant]”, and RM50m to be obtained by way of a bank loan.

</div> These have been particularised at paragraphs 52–53 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 4) (“Statement of Claim”), which I will not reproduce here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendants’ overarching argument</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The defendants primarily emphasise that the plaintiff knowingly signed the Trust Deed, and that there accordingly was no unauthorised conversion of the form of the plaintiff’s investment.

</div> They nonetheless stress that this is immaterial, because the OT Letter was made known to the plaintiff prior to his signing of the Trust Deed. The plaintiff “acknowledged and accepted” the Conversion by signing the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendants appear prepared to accept that they were agents of the plaintiff, but argue that the relevant instrument governing this relationship is the ASTD, not the alleged Agency Agreement. The defendants’ duties, if any, are confined to those stipulated in the ASTD. This is to the exclusion of any other common law duties. The defendants were also not the plaintiff’s “personal advisors”; this is not contemplated in the ASTD.

</div> The same may be said as regards the plaintiff’s consent to the changes to his investment (<span class="font-italic">via</span> the Conversion and his execution of the Trust Deed). This is the basis of the defendants’ arguments against the plaintiff’s claims in contract (the terms of the ASTD), tort (negligence) and equity (breaches of fiduciary duties).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On the plaintiff’s misrepresentation claims, the defendants first dispute that they made the relevant representations. They then re-emphasise the point that the plaintiff had sight of the relevant contractual instruments, relying on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction</span>”). According to the defendants, <span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction</span> stands for the proposition that a plaintiff would not ordinarily be held to be induced by a misrepresentation if the express contractual terms, read and signed, contradict or correct the representor’s misrepresentation.

</div>
</div> They also argue that the circumstances, specifically the plaintiff’s informed consent to each relevant contractual instrument, show that the claims in misrepresentation are untenable on the element of reliance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As may be seen from the preceding paragraphs, the plaintiff has pleaded its case in an imprecise fashion, with multiple factual and legal issues intertwined. The precise basis of each claim also appears unclear at times (see for example [58] above). I hence elaborate at this juncture on the structure of this Judgment and the main issues to focus on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 To the extent that the plaintiff has identified nine distinct issues (see [34] of the plaintiff’s written closing submissions), I prefer not to adopt such an approach for considerations of clarity and precision. Instead, I identify four main issues arising that require sequential determination, as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">The Trust Deed: </span>Whether the plaintiff was bound by the Trust Deed, and whether this represented the <span class="font-italic">final form</span> of his investment in the Chinamall Project. This is, by and large, a factual question.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Changes to the plaintiff’s investment: </span>Whether the established sequence of events show that the nature of the plaintiff’s investment was materially altered without his knowledge or consent. This, likewise, is a factual question.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">Relationship of agency: </span>What was the nature of the “agency” relationship between the parties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>(i) what instrument, if any, governed this relationship; and (ii) what duties flowed from such a relationship. This question is both legal and factual, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it requires a clarification on the law of agency, the law on what duties arise from such an agency relationship, and a discussion on how the facts of the present case fit into the existing legal framework.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s claims: </span>Based on the foregoing, what reliefs the plaintiff is entitled to according to the various heads of claim he pursues in the present suit. In other words, I will discuss under this issue how my findings on the three preceding issues feed into the various claims advanced by the plaintiff. Herein, questions of <span class="font-italic">breach</span> of the relevant duties pleaded by the plaintiff will be discussed, where relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To the extent that narrower lines of inquiry have been identified by the parties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the plaintiff’s nine identified issues), these may be subsumed under the four issues listed above. The former three issues iron out the key areas of factual and legal dispute between the parties. They also establish the important factual and legal premises, based on which the merits of the plaintiff’s various claims (under the fourth issue) may be fruitfully discussed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I explain briefly the rationale and thinking behind the sequence of issues as stated above. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It must first be established what the plaintiff’s investment in the Chinamall Project looked like at the end of his dealings with the defendants. This is the purpose of my discussion on the first issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Trust Deed. By properly setting out what the investment arrangement was at the end of the protracted negotiations, as well as the nature of the circumstances preceding the Trust Deed, a clear picture will emerge as to what the plaintiff’s ultimate position was with respect to the Chinamall Project.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Having established the above, it may then be determined whether the thrust of the plaintiff’s case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that his investment was materially altered without his knowledge/consent, has been made out. This will be done by scrutinising the key investment events in totality. This is a factual question of whether the plaintiff knew and/or agreed that his investment would adopt the final form that it did, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the arrangement involving the Trust Deed. As will be made clear, I do not think that the plaintiff has properly characterised his case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By addressing the second issue (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the nub of the plaintiff’s case or his case theory), there will be clarity on what exactly the plaintiff’s substantive<span class="font-italic"> </span>complaint in the present case is or ought to be. I turn then to set out the parameters of the <span class="font-italic">relationship</span> between the plaintiff and the defendants, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what the plaintiff describes as the “agency relationship”.

In other words, the argument could be that the defendants misrepresented the nature of the changes to the plaintiff.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This is a separate substantive question that is at the heart of the plaintiff’s misrepresentation claims, which I address from [178] onwards below. In short, I am not satisfied that the alleged misrepresentations operated on the mind of the plaintiff to the extent of obscuring the true nature of the Trust Deed and the Conversion consequent to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 There is a third and separate gloss to this argument: the plaintiff takes issue with the fact that the defendants kept him in the dark over several key changes to his investment, in particular the discharge of the Security Documents and the agreement to the OT Letter.

<div class="modal-body">
<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  PCS at para 138.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The issue then is whether the discharge of these documents without the plaintiff’s knowledge meant that he did not or could not make an informed decision in agreeing to the Trust Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view, this line of argument does not aid the plaintiff. It may appear, at first blush, that the plaintiff was “cornered” into signing the Trust Deed, given that he was informed of the discharge of the relevant documents <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>. But several points are pertinent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, if the plaintiff’s real complaint is with respect to the unauthorised discharge of the Security Documents and Investment Agreement, it ought to be framed as a claim in repudiation or repudiatory breach. The plaintiff’s claim not framed as such. The plaintiff took the discharge of the documents in his stride and subsequently agreed to the Trust Deed. He is not making a claim in unauthorised repudiation; his claim is that in leading him to accept the Trust Deed, the defendants acted in breach of duty and/or made misrepresentations to him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This feeds into the second critical point: it was open to the plaintiff to refuse to sign the Trust Deed and, as it were, nip the problem in the bud at that point. He was informed of the termination of the Security Documents <span class="font-italic">via</span> the OT Letter prior to signing the Trust Deed. The plaintiff could have withheld his signature and commenced an action in repudiation against the defendants and/or Midas. He did not. Despite knowing that the Security Documents were discharged, he agreed to the Trust Deed. There was informed consent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the significance of the Trust Deed, specifically clause 10, is that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to the superseding of prior contractual agreements between the parties. Accordingly, even if the Security Documents were not discharged prior to the Trust Deed, the Trust Deed would have had that same effect. In substance, the plaintiff agreed to a discharge of the Security Documents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, even if the plaintiff’s claim was for the defendants’ repudiation of the relevant documents, I express doubts over the viability of such a claim. As the plaintiff voluntarily entered into the Trust Deed and decided to proceed with the investment, it may be said that he waived any prior repudiatory breach of the Security Documents and Investment Agreement on the defendants’ part. I say no more on this issue, given that it is not pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 My findings on this issue inform the nature of the parties’ “agency” relationship, as well as the extent to which the defendants may be said to have acted with due skill, care and diligence; I will elaborate below. What is apparent and important is that the plaintiff at all relevant points in time was <span class="font-italic">apprised of the changes to his investment</span> in the Chinamall Project, and made his own decisions that altered his legal position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn then to address the third issue: the nature of the agency relationship between the parties. As alluded to earlier, there are two components to this discussion. The first pertains to the nature of the agency relationship between the parties, and what exactly this constituted. Herein, we are concerned with identifying the parameters of the parties’ relationship and identifying the scope to which the defendants were allowed to act for or on behalf of the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendants’ authority. The second pertains to the duties that arose as part of this agency relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Before that, however, I highlight a significant problem in the present case: the lack of clarity and precision with which the terms “agent” and “duties of agent” have been used in the parties’ various arguments. The plaintiff, in particular, has left it unclear whether “duties of agent” in the Statement of Claim pertains to contractual or tortious duties, and how these duties specifically arose. The structure of the pleadings also does not lend itself to an easy understanding of the agency issues at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Accordingly, in my view, it would be apt to briefly reiterate and clarify the law of agency in Singapore, specifically on how one should engage in an analysis of an <span class="font-italic">agent’s duties</span>. This would be helpful, given that the court has not had a recent opportunity to clarify this matter. The bulk of contemporary case law has been primarily concerned with the issue of an agent’s <span class="font-italic">authority</span>: see for example<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Alphire Group Pte Ltd v Law Chau Loon and another matter </span>[2020] SGCA 50 (“<span class="font-italic">Alphire Group</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Goh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin </span>[2020] SGHC 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Liew Khoon Fong</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Blasco</span><span class="font-italic">, Martinez Gemma v Ee Meng Yen Angela and another and another matter </span>[2020] SGHC 247 (“<span class="font-italic">Blasco Martinez</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law of agency and the duties of agents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The legal term “agent” is not homogenous or monolithic. “Agent”, in its general sense, simply refers to a relationship, often undergirded by a contractual agreement, where one party is able to <span class="font-italic">act for </span>another party: see Tan Cheng Han, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span>”) at para 01.008. As a result of being able to act for his/her principal, and thereby influence his/her principal’s position and interests, the law imposes various duties on agents. These duties arise for the protection of the principal, who often reposes trust and confidence in the agent. Different duties may arise, attendant to a relationship of agency, such as fiduciary duties, duties of skill and care, and any contractual duties stipulated in the agreement between agent and principal. In this sense, the law of agency involves and overlaps with several other overlapping areas of law such as contract, tort and equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Simply using the terms “agent”, “relationship of agency” or “duties as agent”, however, sheds little to no light on the <span class="font-italic">nuances</span> of the relationship between a specific agent and his or her principal. It goes without saying that different agents affect their principals’ interests to different degrees. This depends on the extent of <span class="font-italic">authority</span> conferred upon the agent. Some agents are sufficiently empowered to, for example, contract for or on behalf of their principal. There are also agents with little, if any, authority to <span class="font-italic">make any decisions </span>for the principal, such as agents who are simply authorised to appear at meetings for the principal in order to satisfy <span class="font-italic">quorum </span>requirements. Within this latter category, is for instance, agents that merely advise on and facilitate transactions, with the principal retaining the ultimate say. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The <span class="font-italic">extent of authority</span> that an agent possesses is a question of fact that is discerned from any express agreement between the parties as well as “the parties’ conduct and the surrounding circumstances”: see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group</span> at [7], citing with approval <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 03.027. Only then can “the existence of the agent’s authority and the <span class="font-italic">scope </span>of that authority” [emphasis in original] be determined: <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group </span>at [7]. In other words, agents and agency relationships exist across a spectrum. This must be borne in mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 It is therefore unsurprising that each unique agency relationship will be accompanied by distinct sets of rights and obligations. It is not the case that every agent will owe, for example, fiduciary duties. In <span class="font-italic">principle</span>, the fact that fiduciary duties may be modified by the agency contract or even completely excluded would mean that situations of agency can and will involve agents that do not owe fiduciary duties: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.036, citing <span class="font-italic">Boardman v Phipps</span> [1967] 2 AC 46. In <span class="font-italic">general</span>, it may be said that the more <span class="font-italic">extensive </span>the agency relationship, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the greater an agent’s authority or ability to affect the principal’s interests, the more onerous the duties imposed upon the agent will be. This follows, as a matter of first principles, from the various areas of law that are engaged in the agency analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 From the perspective of contract law, this is simply a matter of holding parties to their bargain, as embodied by the contract of agency. This is trite and is rooted in the notion of <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span>. The law will give effect to what the parties have expressly agreed on, nothing more and nothing less (save terms to be implied in fact or in law). If the agent agrees to owe the principal onerous duties, then the agent is so bound. If the principal fails to stipulate in the contract of agency the relevant duties that it wishes to impose on the agent, it cannot later cavil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In the context of tort law, this is a question of the extent of the duty of care that arises on the facts. For instance, in the area of negligence, this is broadly construed based on the <span class="font-italic">proximity</span> between agent and principal. Trite factors in this inquiry include control, knowledge, reliance and assumption of responsibility: see the Court of Appeal’s seminal decision in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The existence and contours of an agent’s tortious duties are also shaped by the <span class="font-italic">specific </span>context in which they arise, for example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where solicitors act as agents for individuals in property transactions: <span class="font-italic">Tan &amp; Au LLP v Goh Teh Lee </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Yoong Weng Ho Robert </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 751.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where agents give advice to, and act for principals, in stockbroking transactions: <span class="font-italic">OCBC Securities Pte Ltd v Yeo Siew Huan</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 481 (“<span class="font-italic">OCBC Securities</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where auditors act as agents for businesses in the sense that they conducted audits on behalf of the relevant businesses: <span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm) </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 (“<span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where duties are alleged to have arisen <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>individuals that may be characterised as independent contractors and involve questions of vicarious liabilities and non-delegable duties. In these more contentious areas, the concept of agency may instead be invoked as a <span class="font-italic">justification </span>or <span class="font-italic">legal test</span> that shapes the extent of the duties: see for instance the observations in Yoong, “Challenges in the Evolution of the Doctrine of Non-delegable Duty” (2018) 25 Tort L Rev 143 at pp 162–163.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Also relevant are the principles on the interface between contractual and tortious duties and how these interact. The relevant questions are whether, and to what extent, any contractual instrument curtails or expands on the common law tortious duties, and whether similar duties can coexist in both contract and tort. This is relevant to my discussion below on the defendants’ argument that the existence of the <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> agency relationship precludes common law <span class="font-italic">tortious</span> duties from arising on the defendants’ part (see [169]–[173] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Viewed from the lens of equity or the law on fiduciaries, this is a question of the extent of the agent’s position of ascendancy over the principal and authority to act on behalf of the principal. This is the cornerstone of all fiduciary relationships, in recognition of the fact that authority of this nature is often reposed in the agent in trust and confidence. Where an agent is able to unilaterally and significantly influence his/her principal’s position or interests and has been conferred such powers in trust and confidence, extensive fiduciary duties may arise. On the other hand, where the agent has limited authority and discretion, the agent will owe few, if any, fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In particular, case law has clarified that just because an agent may be considered a fiduciary in a limited manner (specifically, for matters in which he or she is allowed to exercise judgment or discretion to affect certain interests of the principal), this does not mean that <span class="font-italic">every</span> duty the agent owes to the principal is a fiduciary duty. This is clear from the seminal decision of <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew </span>[1998] 1 Ch 1 at p 16. Therein, Millett LJ stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Despite the warning given by Fletcher Moulton L.J. in <span class="font-italic">In re Coomber; Coomber v Coomber</span> [1911] 1 Ch 723, 728, this branch of the law has been bedevilled by unthinking resort to verbal formulae. It is therefore necessary to begin by defining one’s terms. The expression “fiduciary duty” is properly confined to those duties which are peculiar to fiduciaries and the breach of which attracts legal consequences differing from those consequent upon the breach of other duties. Unless the expression is so limited it is lacking in practical utility. In this sense it is obvious that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not every breach of duty by a fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Millett LJ’s observation on the “unthinking resort to verbal formulae” is apt when one considers the looseness with which the term “agent” has been used by parties in the present suit. One must define with clarity the exact contours of each agency relationship and the attendant duties that arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The same observation has been made locally. Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 265 at [28] that “care had to be taken not to equate the duty of good faith and loyalty owed by every employee with a fiduciary obligation” (citing <span class="font-italic">Nottingham University v Fishel </span>[2000] IRLR 471 with approval). The same logic extends to contractual agents, who may not be “employees” in the strict sense, but are nonetheless employed by their principals to engage in a certain course of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Agency stands at the intersection of these various other areas of law but does not displace the fundamental principles that undergird each. Defining a particular agency relationship hence depends on an application of the rules established within these different areas of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As for the <span class="font-italic">evidential approach</span> to questions of agency, any express agreement or implied agreement (as evinced by conduct) between the parties will be relevant; I have alluded to this at [92] above in referencing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([90] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). It is important in every case to identify and establish the existence and terms of any contractual instruments entered into by parties. Relevant also will be to scrutinise the conduct of the parties in the course of the relationship of agency, and how they have acted in transactions involving the principal. Specifically, one must focus on transactions in which the agent was able to exercise the authority conferred by the principal. Only then can one reach a conclusion on the degree to which an agent is able to affect the principal’s interests, and consequently the duties that are to be imposed on the agent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Where the allegations pertaining to an agent’s authority are unclear, it will not be easy to distil the duties that arise from the agency relationship. I use the plaintiff’s pleadings as an illustration. The Statement of Claim is somewhat confusing and does not properly engage with the nuances present in situations of agency. I use the following aspects of the pleadings to illustrate:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On the one hand, the plaintiff avers that, according to the alleged Agency Agreement between the parties, the first defendant “will act in accordance with the instructions of the [plaintiff]”.

</div> Alongside this, the plaintiff avers that the first defendant will provide the plaintiff with “timely information and/or advice”. These collectively suggest that the plaintiff retained the final say on all material aspects of his investment, and the first defendant acted simply as an advisor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the other hand, the plaintiff avers that “the [plaintiff] reposed trust and confidence in the [defendants] as the [plaintiff] relied on the [defendants] to act for and on his behalf on any and all matters arising from… the Chinamall Project”.

</div>
</div> This averment is somewhat different, and suggests that the defendants had significant discretion in making important decisions on the plaintiff’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 From the above, it is unclear what the plaintiff’s case is. Is it that the defendants were substantially empowered to <span class="font-italic">execute instruments/legally binding documents “on his behalf”</span> (which is suggested by [104(b)] above)? Or is it that the defendants played merely an <span class="font-italic">advisory role</span> and acted as a “mere conduit”, and the plaintiff retained the final say in all material matters (which is suggested by [104(a)] above)? Or is it, perhaps, an amalgamation of both scenarios pleaded? These two positions are not readily reconcilable – the former involves a far more extensive degree of powers conferred on the agent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 This is highly significant – depending on the manner in which the agency relationship is characterised by the plaintiff, the nature of the attendant duties alleged to arise will also vastly differ. For example, several fiduciary duties may arise if the defendants possessed significant latitude and discretion to <span class="font-italic">unilaterally</span> affect the plaintiff’s interest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if the defendants could create legal relations on behalf of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the plaintiff. However, these duties may not exist (or at least be more confined) if the relationship can be more properly recognised as one of an advisor and advisee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">A broad framework for analysing the duties of agents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Based on the foregoing, I set out a general three-step framework that may be adopted in cases involving alleged breaches of the duties of agents. To be clear, this framework does not involve the espousal of any new law. It is a suggested manner of synthesising the various relevant areas of law, as they currently exist, that often arise in the agency analysis. It is also to aid with the identification and understanding of the veiled issues of fact and law that often lurk beneath the façade of the parties’ cases. The purpose of the framework is to clearly identify an agent’s duties in any given case and to allow for a neat and comprehensive resolution of disputes involving duties of agents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first step: Discerning the agent’s authority</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The first step is to identify all the relevant contractual instruments and any other relevant conduct by the parties, in order to establish the true scope of the agent’s authority. “Scope” comes in two senses: the extent of the agent’s authority (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the matters in which the agent was allowed to act for the principal and the degree of autonomy the agent possessed) and the duration that this authority subsisted for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 It is important to be comprehensive in this exercise, and to examine <span class="font-italic">all of the parties’ dealings </span>in relation to the transaction or transactions in dispute. Of foremost importance will be the agency agreement, if any. Herein may lie questions relating to the formation of contracts. Contemporaneous conduct will also shed valuable light. The evidential points raised in <span class="font-italic">Alphire Group</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([90] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), as reproduced at [92] above, are pertinent. Relevant also are the analyses in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Liew Khoon Fong</span> ([90] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Blasco Martinez</span> ([90] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). These demonstrate how the court has generally undertaken this exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The <span class="font-italic">temporal scope</span> of the relevant instruments and the parties’ conduct is also of utmost importance, given that this directly affects the duration of the agency relationship (which, self-evidently, may survive the discharge of a contract or may even exist without a contract). The question to ask is “when and for how long did the individual or entity act as agent for the principal?” This question is answered by examining the instances where the agent exercised his or her authority, as well as any conduct of the principal demonstrating that the principal regarded the agent as possessing the relevant authority. The general idea is to discern a <span class="font-italic">course of conduct</span>. The end result of the first step is that one will be able to clearly discern the <span class="font-italic">extent </span><span class="font-italic">of the agent’s authority</span> and the <span class="font-italic">duration for which the agent’s authority persisted</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second step: Identifying the agent’s duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The second step is to identify, based on the agent’s authority, the duties owed by the agent. The key areas of law that will typically be relevant are contract, tort and equity and trusts, as canvassed above. This is of course not an exhaustive list. A key limiting factor, at the risk of stating the obvious, would be the parties’ pleadings and how they have framed their case. If a party pleads an agency claim in contract and not in tort or equity, that party is so bound.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 At this step, the different areas of law ought to be analysed <span class="font-italic">separately</span> as a starting point, with reference to the agent’s authority as defined in the first step. I have suggested above, in broad terms, how the analysis under each area of law may be conducted (see [95]–[101] above). Then, there remains to consider how these different areas of law overlap or segue into each other. The usual suspects in this inquiry are contractual exclusion clauses and various forms of estoppel. The question is whether the duties that arise in one area of law are circumscribed, modified or negated due to the existence of the obligations or duties arising from another area of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Critical under the second step is also to bear in mind the relevant timeframe within which the agent’s authority subsisted, and the provenance of such authority, as determined under the first step. This directly impacts the nature of the duties that bind the agent at any given time. To illustrate, a contractual agency agreement may for some reason be terminated in the course of the parties’ dealings. When the contract concludes, its terms no longer bind the parties; express contractual obligations are extinguished. If, however, the agent continues to act for the principal in the same capacity as that stipulated under their now-discharged contract, two questions arise. One, has a new implied contract arisen? Two, if no implied contract has arisen, is the agent nonetheless still bound by duties under common law (tort) and equity, given that the agent still possessed authority and continued acting for the principal? The distinction between these two permutations may not always be clear; but attaining an answer to the underlying question of the duration of the agency relationship is essential. All turns on the particular facts of the case at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Having clearly established the existence and scope of the agent’s duties, we may then turn to the third step.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third step: Identifying breaches of the respective duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 This third and final step hinges on an application of the rules on breach that exist in the various relevant areas of law. I will not endeavour to go through each area of law at this juncture. Instead, I offer some observations on common problems that arise in the agency context where there are multiple parallel claims made by a plaintiff, and propose solutions to these problems.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 First, it is crucial to keep the analyses of the various breaches distinct. The different breaches may well involve the same act or acts by the agent. But to lump them together (as the plaintiff has done in the Statement of Claim) does not make for smooth analysis and resolution. To illustrate, negligence and the fiduciary obligation to act in the principal’s best interests are quite distinct. One may act unreasonably carelessly but loyally and in what one believes to be in the principal’s interests. On the other hand, one may act against the principal’s interests but not be careless or negligent in the endeavour. Each question of breach is fact sensitive. More importantly, one act may have different dimensions: the motive, execution and outcome of a single act can be parsed and might lend themselves to different conclusions. Conflating claims and addressing them in bulk serves only to confuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Another important consideration is to ensure that there is no double recovery. The rule against double recovery is trite: see for instance <span class="font-italic">Chew Kong Huat and others v Ricwil (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1167, citing <span class="font-italic">Personal Representatives of Tang Man </span><span class="font-italic">Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd </span>[1996] AC 514 at 522, at [36]. It may often be the case that one set of actions by an agent results in a breach of both contractual and tortious duties. If so, that renders the agent liable under both contract and tort. But that does not mean that the agent pays twice for one wrong. The specific heads of loss (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, expectation loss, reliance loss, loss of profits, injury to the person, pure economic loss or even psychiatric harm) must be identified with clarity, and <span class="font-italic">separately </span>with reference to each individual claim. These multiple heads of loss must then be construed against each other, and any overlap must be identified and accounted for. A plaintiff can only be compensated for the loss it actually suffered, and even then, not more than once.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 With the framework as proposed, agency disputes involving multifaceted claims may be more neatly and efficiently resolved. I will adopt this framework in my analysis of the present case. Accordingly, I first discuss the key documents and instruments in this case that shed light on the true nature of the authority conferred and limitations imposed on the defendants. Only then will one be able to arrive at an accurate conclusion on the nature of the duties owed by the defendants to the plaintiff (and, subsequently, whether these duties were breached).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The nature of the agency relationship between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant instruments governing the agency relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The two main contractual instruments to be considered are the ASTD and the Agency Agreement alleged by the plaintiff. The Trust Deed is also relevant. To reiterate, the plaintiff’s case in this respect is that the ASTD is not binding, and that the alleged Agency Agreement had arisen between the parties as <span class="font-italic">per</span> the terms stated in the 19 November 2013 email and the Term Sheet. The defendants’ position is that the ASTD was binding until it was discharged by the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The ASTD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The ASTD is, as apparent on the face of the document, a contractual document that purports to govern the relationship of agency between the parties.

The plaintiff argues that the lack of signature is fatal to the ASTD’s status as a legally binding document. The defendants submit that signature was a mere formality and did not preclude the ASTD from having legally binding effect.

It is also consistent with the manner in which, after executing the Investment Documents, the plaintiff constantly corresponded with the defendants and received a consistent stream of advice from them on all matters related to the Chinamall Project. The ASTD pertained to exactly that. It is an instrument that, for all intents and purposes, was designed to govern the agency relationship that arose between the parties in the course of their dealings over the Chinamall Project. This is apparent from the terms of the ASTD, as reproduced at [120] above. It is also material that the ASTD was appended to the CLN T&amp;Cs, which suggests a <span class="font-italic">composite</span> contractual structure involving the Investment Agreement, the Convertible Loan Note, the CLN T&amp;Cs and the ASTD.

In this deal, as mentioned, the defendants likewise acted as the plaintiff’s agents. The plaintiff has not rebutted the evidence suggesting that the arrangement with respect to the Chinamall Project by and large mirrored that parties’ arrangement for the Yang Kee Deal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the defendants were the middlemen who facilitated the plaintiff’s investment and the agents who kept the plaintiff apprised of the status of his investment. It is also reasonable to infer that it was the success of the Yang Kee Deal, and the plaintiff’s satisfaction with the defendants’ involvement in the same, that led him to agreeing to the defendants acting on his behalf, in a similar if not identical capacity, in respect of the investment in the Chinamall Project. The entire course of dealing between the parties paints a clear and logical picture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 To be clear, the defendants are not relying on the Yang Kee Deal as similar fact evidence and are not engaging in reasoning by propensity. In other words, they are not arguing that just because the plaintiff entered into a similar instrument in the Yang Kee Deal, he must have entered into the ASTD. The defendants simply point to the Yang Kee Deal to demonstrate a course of dealing that informs the court of the plaintiff’s state of mind during the course of his investment in the Chinamall Project. The Yang Kee Deal is relevant, and in fact pertinent, because it demonstrates the manner in which the plaintiff and the defendants have conducted their contractual dealings. It is also, in any event, not the only piece of evidence the defendants rely on in proving that the plaintiff entered into the ASTD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Finally, it bears mention that the plaintiff relies heavily on the Term Sheet in his arguments against the defendants. By his own case, the Term Sheet is relevant and pertinent. The Term Sheet was provided to the plaintiff at an early juncture, on or about 21 November 2013. Crucially, the Term Sheet states that the “Form of Documentation” for the investment in the Chinamall Project would involve “d) Security Agent/ Trustee Agreement”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the ASTD (see [13] above). The Term Sheet also alludes to the <span class="font-italic">composite contractual structure</span> I have mentioned at [123] above. These fortify my conclusion that the plaintiff’s entire course of conduct is consistent with him knowing of the existence of the ASTD and acting on the basis of this agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It is hence my view that the plaintiff had, by way of his conduct, accepted the ASTD. The ASTD and its terms governed the relationship of agency between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Discharge of the ASTD</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Another question that arises is whether, and if so when, the ASTD was discharged by virtue of the discharge of the Investment Agreement. I note that the plaintiff does not raise this point, given that he advances the case that the ASTD was never binding in the first place. It is nevertheless a point that warrants consideration for completeness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In my view, the ASTD was discharged alongside the Investment Agreement <span class="font-italic">due to the operation of t</span><span class="font-italic">he Trust Deed</span>.

</div> This term is rather clear on its face. The plaintiff agreed to this term by signing the Trust Deed.

</div> But aside from pleading the terms to be implied into this agreement (for which the plaintiff could provide no contemporaneous evidence), the plaintiff could offer few, if any, details on the specifics of the agreement, and certainly no evidence demonstrating its formation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The timing of formation of the alleged Agency Agreement was never canvassed clearly in the plaintiff’s case. The suggestion is that there was offer and acceptance when the plaintiff “agreed to the 1st Defendant’s offer for it to act as… agent”, pursuant to the 19 November 2013 email and the Term Sheet. However, as mentioned, the Term Sheet clearly references the ASTD (see [128] above). I do not believe that there was an offer made by the defendants that was accepted at that juncture. The offer and acceptance only arose when the Investment Agreement was executed, and the Convertible Loan Note was issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Accordingly, and in the light of my discussion on the significance of the ASTD and the parties’ conduct pursuant to it, I do not accept that there was a separate oral agreement in the form of the Agency Agreement as pleaded by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other relevant instruments and the parties’ conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 As earlier alluded to, the Trust Deed is also relevant in defining the agency relationship between the parties, given that it created the investment structure as set out at [74]–[75] above, and resulted in the superseding of the ASTD (see [131] above). On its face, the Trust Deed would suggest that the first defendant stood not just as agent in the sense explained in the preceding paragraphs, but also, at the very least, as <span class="font-italic">bare trustee</span> <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a trustee that held the <span class="font-italic">US$1.6m loan</span> (a chose in action, or a putative one at the very least)<span class="font-italic"> </span>on trust for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 <span class="font-italic">However, this is not the plaintiff’s case</span>.

</div> This is pursuant to clause 4.2(a) of the ASTD (see [120] above). The first defendant was accordingly “contractually empowered to bind the [p]laintiff to a change in the structure of the investments as long as it had the consent of the Majority”. This authority subsisted during the duration of the ASTD, and there is no evidence that it survived the ASTD’s discharge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendants did not contract on behalf of the plaintiff and there is no evidence that the plaintiff would have consented to them doing so).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 This is consistent with clause 4.2(d)(ii) of the ASTD (see [120] above) that absent any decision from the majority noteholders, the defendants required the plaintiff’s “approv[al] in writing” before they could execute and deliver any documents related to the investment.

</div> As such, I will not engage in a trust analysis, and will not consider whether fiduciary duties arose on the part of the first defendant with reference to the Trust Deed.

</div> I agree. It is clear from the facts canvassed earlier that the plaintiff still reserved the final say on each critical decision in the course of his dealings with the defendants. The plaintiff chose to make the investment in the Chinamall Project according to the terms of the Investment Agreement and was issued the Convertible Loan Note as a result. The plaintiff then agreed to the terms of the Trust Deed and signed that instrument. After the discharge of the ASTD, the defendants also did not contract for or on behalf of the plaintiff. All of these show that the defendants did not contract on behalf of the plaintiff at any point in time. In this respect, the issue of fiduciary duties does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 That said, I accept that the defendants owed fiduciary duties in the context of dispensing advice. That was the nature of the agreement between the parties. The defendants were engaged by the plaintiff to advise the plaintiff on the various aspects of his investment, and were given the authority to, at their discretion, provide timely and accurate information. This much is clear from the terms of the ASTD, and from the correspondence exchanged between the second defendant and the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">via</span> Ms Tiolani). The defendants accordingly had discretion and latitude in determining when to dispense advice, and what advice to dispense to the plaintiff. In this respect, they owed fiduciary duties to <span class="font-italic">provide advice loyally and in good faith, with the plaintiff’s best interests in mind given the prevailing circumstances</span>. This was the extent of judgment and discretion that the defendants had to apply in performing their roles as agents of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 These fiduciary duties extended to <span class="font-italic">the manner in which the defendants facilitated the execution of the Chinamall Project</span> whilst advising the plaintiff. In other words, the defendants had a fiduciary duty to ensure that the plaintiff’s interests were generally looked after in the course of the Chinamall Project. While not the direct purport of the ASTD, this is a duty that necessarily must arise given the context. As is evident from how things transpired, the defendants, being the parties that directly contracted with Midas (under the Investment Agreement and subsequently in the 26 July 2014 MOA), were empowered to make key decisions that would affect the positions of the investors that they advised, including the plaintiff. A key example is how the defendants were able to discharge the Security Documents without the plaintiff’s prior authorisation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I do not accept the defendants’ argument that because the ASTD does not expressly contemplate the defendants dispensing advice on the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the plaintiff’s investment, the defendants are precluded from owing fiduciary duties to the plaintiff to look after his substantive interests.

</div>
</div> As a matter of common sense, the defendants must have owed such duties, given that they stood in a position where they were able to control the type of information that reached the plaintiff, and were able to dispense advice to that effect. As a matter of fact, the advice dispensed by the second defendant did bear shades of <span class="font-italic">substantive advice on the merits of the investment</span>. For example, the second defendant made substantive comments on the “fast turnaround” nature of the project, and advised the plaintiff on the value of the Mall and its potential as security in the context of the First Representation (I will address shortly why I am persuaded that this representation was made; see [178]–[180] below). Having actually dispensed such advice to the plaintiff, the defendants stood in a position of ascendancy over the plaintiff. Having taken the defendants’ advice, the plaintiff clearly reposed trust and confidence in them. The defendants cannot now say that they were not obliged to act with the plaintiff’s interests in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The fundamental contours of the defendants’ fiduciary duties may be discerned from the literature and jurisprudence. First, the defendants had to subordinate their personal interests to the plaintiff’s in matters connected to the dispensing of advice to the plaintiff (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.031). The defendants would also have been expected to perform their advisory tasks on the best terms available to the plaintiff in the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.032). The defendants also must not place themselves in a position where their duty to the plaintiff might conflict with their personal interests (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.042, citing <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Crucially, the scope of these duties was modified by the terms of the ASTD. As noted earlier, fiduciary duties can be contractually altered (see [94] above). The defendants point to two such modifications in closing submissions.

The defendants were not obliged to prefer the plaintiff’s interests over the interests of the collective.

</div>
</div> In my view, this argument proves too much. I do not accept that clause 4.4 allows the defendants’ interests to wholly supersede the interests of the noteholders. That would defeat the very purpose of the agency arrangement and the defendants’ facilitative and advisory role in the investment. I accept, at best, that the defendants were allowed to construe their interests <span class="font-italic">alongside</span> the interests of the investors, with a view to making the investment in the Chinamall Project profitable for all. After all, the defendants stood to gain if the investments bore fruit (in terms of commissions and also the direct investments the defendants themselves made in the Chinamall Project). The focus is whether the defendants acted to further <span class="font-italic">all the stakeholders’ interests</span>, by striving for the success of the Chinamall Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I add that the discharge of the ASTD had no bearing on the existence of fiduciary duties owed by the defendants. While the fiduciary duties, as evident from my analysis, arose primarily from the defendants’ advisory role <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the plaintiff, which in turn was circumscribed by limitations set out in the ASTD, the defendants did not cease their provision of updates and advice to the plaintiff after the termination of the ASTD. There was substantive correspondence exchanged thereafter, as mentioned at [138] above. As a result, the defendants still stood in a position of ascendancy <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the plaintiff and could exercise their discretion in dispensing advice to the plaintiff. The defendants accordingly remained bound by certain fiduciary duties as I have delineated above throughout the course of their dealings with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I also consider the <span class="font-italic">modifications</span> imposed by the ASTD to the defendants’ fiduciary duties to have persisted even after the discharge of the ASTD. These modifications pertain primarily to the defendants having to look after the <span class="font-italic">collective’s</span> interests (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, all investors in the Chinamall Project), instead of preferring one investor’s interests over another’s. After the Conversion and the consequent discharge of the ASTD, the investments in the Chinamall Project very much retained the same complexion and remained a multi-party endeavour. It still involved multiple investors, including the plaintiff and the defendants. The understanding of the parties as set out in the ASTD never changed; all that changed was the formal discharge of a contractual document (the ASTD). In other words, the trust and confidence reposed in the defendants by the plaintiff, as influenced by the contours of the Trust Deed which the plaintiff signed, was <span class="font-italic">in the context of an arrangement involving multiple investors</span>. Accordingly, I am of the view that the defendants retained the discretion to act in what they believed to be the best interests of the <span class="font-italic">collective</span>, and in so far as they acted to further the success of the Chinamall Project in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> manner, they would not have breached their fiduciary duties, the nature of which I have set out above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Contractual duties as agent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Based on the plaintiff’s pleadings, the alleged “duties as agent” comprise the following contractual duties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a duty to act in accordance with the plaintiff’s instructions;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) duties of reasonable skill, care and diligence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a duty to provide timely information and advice;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) a duty to take all reasonable steps to protect the plaintiff’s interest and/or investment in the Chinamall Project;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) a duty of no-conflict; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) a duty of good faith to act in the best interests of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The plaintiff’s case is that these terms are to be <span class="font-italic">implied into the Agency Agreement</span>. A problem with this argument is that I have found that the alleged Agency Agreement does not exist; instead, I have found the relevant contractual instrument between the parties to be the ASTD (prior to its discharge). Accordingly, to construe the plaintiff’s pleadings very strictly, there is no longer any Agency Agreement for the pleaded terms to be implied into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 That said, I consider the essence of the plaintiff’s argument to be that the relevant pleaded terms should be implied into any <span class="font-italic">contractual instrument</span> governing the parties’ agency relationship. This would be the ASTD, and the question then is whether the plaintiff’s pleaded terms may be implied into the ASTD. The implication of terms, in any case, involves an application of <span class="font-italic">law</span> and an exercise performed by the court; in so far as the <span class="font-italic">facts</span> that would give rise to such implication have been pleaded (which they have), the court can consider whether the relevant terms may be implied into the ASTD instead of the Agency Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 There is no need to imply the terms reproduced at [155(a)] and [155(c)] above. These terms have been in substance encapsulated in the terms of the ASTD, as reproduced at [120] above (specifically clauses 4.1 and 4.2(d)(ii)). There is also no need to imply the terms reproduced at [155(e)] and [155(f)]. These arise as fiduciary duties by operation of equity, as explained at [146] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 There is no material difference between the terms stated at [155(b)] and [155(d)]. These are, in substance, obligations of reasonable skill, care and diligence that the defendants must observe in dispensing advice and providing timely updates to the plaintiff. Such a term is not contained in the ASTD expressly. In my view, such a term ought to be implied into the ASTD. This has been recognised as a <span class="font-italic">general</span> duty of agents and may exist expressly or impliedly in contract (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.013).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I note the existence of clause 4.2(d)(iv) of the ASTD, which appears to be an entire agreement clause (see [120] above). This clause, however, does not preclude the implication of terms necessary for business efficacy, which are <span class="font-italic">intrinsic</span> to the contract, but exclude only terms <span class="font-italic">extrinsic</span> to the contract. This distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic implied terms was considered by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association v Singapore Shooting Association and others</span> [2019] SGHC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>, Pang JC (as he then was) considered an entire agreement clause, which reads (at [132]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15. Entire Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the matters dealt with in this Agreement and supersedes and cancels in all respects all previous agreements and undertakings, if any, between the Parties, whether written or oral. Each Party acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement, it does not do so on the basis of, and does not rely on, any representation, warranty or other provision except as expressly provided herein, and all conditions, warranties or other terms implied by statute or common law are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The court noted the distinction between intrinsic implied terms and extrinsic implied terms, citing at [139] the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Axa Sun Life Services Plc v Campbell Martin Ltd </span>[2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1, and the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span>”). Based on these authorities, Pang JC opined (at [140]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">140 The following principles may be derived from the foregoing cases:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Terms implied in order to give business efficacy to an agreement are intrinsic to the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) They would therefore not be precluded by an entire agreement clause which merely excludes matters extrinsic to the written agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Nevertheless, since the effect of an entire agreement clause ultimately turns on the proper construction of the actual words used in the clause, it may still be possible for intrinsic implied terms to be excluded if there are clear and unambiguous words which expressly and specifically exclude such implied terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The court in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span> also expressly cited portions of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span>, and reproduced the following material parts of that Judgment (at [136]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">136 The Court of Appeal then went on to make the following observations (at [31]–[32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, we would also pause to observe that, even if there is no reference to implied terms in an entire agreement clause, it is arguable that the presence of such a clause in a contract would not, as a matter of general principle, exclude the implication of terms into that contract for several reasons. First, an implied term, by its very nature (as an implied term), would not, <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span>, have been in the contemplation of the contracting parties to begin with when they entered into the contract. Secondly, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if a term were implied on, so to speak, a “broader” basis “in law” (as opposed to on a “narrower” basis “in fact”), it would follow, a fortiori, that such a term would not have been in the contemplation of</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> the parties for, as we shall see below (at [38]), a term which is implied “in law” (unlike a term which is implied “in fact”) is not premised on the presumed intention of the contracting parties as such</span>. Thirdly, it is clearly established law that a term cannot be implied if it is <span class="font-italic">inconsistent with</span> an <span class="font-italic">express</span> term of the contract concerned. This principle is, of course, both logical as well as commonsensical. Finally, as pointed out by Nigel Teare QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court) in <span class="font-italic">Exxonmobil</span><span class="font-italic"> Sales and Supply Corp v Texaco Ltd</span> [2004] 1 All ER (Comm) 435 at [27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It [is] … arguable that where it is necessary to imply a term in order to make the express terms work such an implied term may not be excluded by [an] entire agreement clause</span> because it could be said that such a term is to be found in the document or documents forming part of the contract. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That having been said, we are <span class="font-italic">not</span> prepared to state that an entire agreement clause can never exclude the implication of terms into a contract. However, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for an entire agreement clause to have this effect, it</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> would need to express such effect in clear and unambiguous language</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Here, the term encapsulating the duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence is a term to be implied based on business efficacy and of necessity. It is, as <span class="font-italic">per</span> the observations in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 07.013), a general duty of agents that is to be implied into agreements of this sort. This stands to reason, given that agents are expected to act with due care in acting for their principals. This is required for business efficacy, given that absent such a term, agents may carelessly or recklessly prejudice their principals’ interests by rendering haphazard and blasé advice, which would render the agency agreement absurd and unworkable. It is also by no means an overly onerous duty, as it comports with pre-existing notions of duty of care under the common law. To this extent, such a term of reasonable skill, care and diligence may be rightly recognised as a term to be implied in <span class="font-italic">law</span> and not in fact, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it applies to all contracts of this species.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Pursuant to the framework espoused in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span> at [140], there is also no express and specific language excluding a term of this nature. I acknowledge that clause 4.2(d)(iv) of the ASTD states that the defendants “have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in the Agreement”, and that on one interpretation, this is to the exclusion of <span class="font-italic">all</span> other duties. However, I echo Pang JC’s sentiments in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>, and the Court of Appeal’s views in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span>: in particular, the duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence is a term implied in <span class="font-italic">law</span>. In my view, there are countervailing considerations when considering terms to be implied in law, which militate against a strict and inflexible operation of the foundational principle of consent in contract law. These terms are implied to provide essential and necessary appendages to contracts that do not expressly contain them. Accordingly, absent very <span class="font-italic">specific and unambiguous</span> language that <span class="font-italic">expressly excludes</span> terms implied in law as a category, I do not accept that such terms are excluded by operation of clause 4.2(d)(iv). I accordingly imply the duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence into the ASTD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The express terms in the ASTD and the implied term of reasonable skill, care and diligence subsisted as <span class="font-italic">contractual obligations </span>on the defendants’ part until the termination of the ASTD, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 20 November 2014 when the Trust Deed was executed. This is the relevant timeframe in which I will consider the alleged contractual breaches committed by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 There also remains to consider whether similar “duties as agent” concurrently arose at common law, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, tortious duties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Duty of care under the law on negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 An issue with the plaintiff’s case on negligence is that the particulars relating to the specifics of the duty of care, the standard of care, the breach of duty, and issues of causation/remoteness have not been set out clearly.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I do not accept the reasoning behind the defendants’ argument on their duty of care. The argument is that there is to be equality of treatment in the contractual context as between all investors in the Chinamall Project. Such equality of treatment, however, does not mean that there ceases to be duties owed by the defendants to the plaintiff (or, for that matter, to the other investors) in common law. I cannot see how the absence of common law duties follows as a logical conclusion from the mere fact of equality of treatment of investors under contractual obligations. In some circumstances, a contract may, subject to the restrictions stipulated in the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed), expressly exclude liability for negligence (see also <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span> at [32]). But the ASTD does not exclude such tortious liability. Clause 4.2(d)(iv) of the ASTD, for reasons similar to those provided at [164] above, does not specifically exclude liability for negligence. There is simply nothing in the ASTD that negates the defendants’ common law duty of care to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Relevant also is clause 4.2(c) of the ASTD, which states that the defendants may refrain from acting in the interests of the investors until they (the defendants) have been indemnified, <span class="font-italic">except to the extent that losses arise as a result of “negligence or wilful conduct”</span> by the defendants (see [120] above). This term, construed in context, shows that the defendants’ liability for negligence was contemplated and <span class="font-italic">not</span> excluded. The defendants remained responsible for any losses occasioned by their own negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 It is indeed clear that agents standing in the shoes of the defendants owe a duty of care to their clients, such as the plaintiff, to act reasonably and to render advice diligently. I have alluded to this earlier: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency </span>describes the duty of skill and care as a general<span class="font-italic"> </span>duty that exists on the part of agents (see [159] above). I have also explained why the imposition of such a duty is necessary and sound in the context of agents who act in an advisory capacity (see [163] above). It is thus unnecessary to engage in a detailed analysis using the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> ([96] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) framework: it is quite clear that agents such as the defendants are sufficiently proximate <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>their principals, and consequently do, and should, owe their principals a duty of care to act with due skill, care and diligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Liability of this sort may often concurrently lie in <span class="font-italic">both</span> contract and<span class="font-italic"> </span>tort, subject to the trite limitations to double recovery (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.013, citing <span class="font-italic">Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta v Butcher</span> [1988] 3 WLR 565 (“<span class="font-italic">Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta</span>”)). I emphasise the observations of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta </span>(at p 571):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I start by pointing out that Vesta pleaded its claim against the brokers in contract and tort. This is but a recognition of what I regard as <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a clearly established principle</span> that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where under the general law a person owes a duty to another to exercise reasonable care and skill in some activity, a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">breach of that duty gives rise to a claim in tort notwithstanding the fact that the activity is the subject matter of a contract between them</span>. In such a case the breach of duty will also be a breach of contract. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 That such common law tortious liability coexists with contractual liability under documents under the ASTD is unobjectionable in principle. Contract law compensates one for what one was promised; tort law seeks to compensate for the harm to the individual. These principles coexist. The only unprincipled outcome the law seeks to prevent is <span class="font-italic">double recovery</span>, and that is a matter to be dealt with when addressing the issues of loss and quantum, <span class="font-italic">not </span>liability. There is thus no basis to argue that the defendants did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care to act reasonably and diligently in their dealings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The defendants’ duty of care under common law arose when they began advising the plaintiff on the Chinamall Project (in November 2013), and subsisted throughout the entirety of their dealings, even during the insolvency of Midas. The ASTD did nothing to negate this duty, and its discharge certainly had no effect on the duty. More importantly, as explained, the defendants continued acting for the plaintiff even after the discharge of the ASTD. They were thus obliged, in so doing, to act with due care.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Having set out the attendant duties that arose from the agency relationship between the parties, I turn now to analyse the plaintiff’s claims in detail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on the plaintiff’s various claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I note the lack of organisation in the plaintiff’s written closing submissions. The plaintiff has levelled multiple disjointed factual allegations and reproduced facts (albeit relevant) in large bulk without necessarily drawing the link between these facts and the relevant claims in the Statement of Claim. It also appears, as pointed out by the defendants in their written reply submissions, that the plaintiff has not focussed much on his contractual claims, although it is admittedly unclear whether these claims have been jettisoned entirely, given the extent and nature of the factual allegations levelled in the plaintiff’s closing submissions. As such, in my analysis, I will closely track the claims made by the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim and structure my analysis accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The misrepresentation claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 As mentioned, the plaintiff’s claims in this regard are twofold: he brings an action in (a) common law fraudulent misrepresentation; and (b) statutory misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the relevant representations were made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As a preliminary matter, I am of the view that the second defendant did make the relevant representations, as alleged by the plaintiff, during a phone call on 20 November 2014 (see [36], [61] and [62] above). This phone call must have occurred. In context, it is clear that the plaintiff had concerns over the status of his investment, namely the lack of security as suggested by the absence of any reference to the Security Documents in the Trust Deed. This is why the plaintiff implored Ms Tiolani to contact the defendants over this issue on 18 November 2014 <span class="font-italic">via</span> email. Following this, and after the alleged phone call on 20 November 2014, the plaintiff agreed to sign the Trust Deed. Ms Tiolani then informed the second defendant of such in her email dated 20 November 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 As a matter of logic and prudence, something must have happened after 18 November 2014, when the plaintiff voiced his concerns over the lack of security in the Conversion, and 20 November 2014, when the plaintiff, as <span class="font-italic">per</span> his unrefuted evidence, agreed to sign the Trust Deed.

</div> There must have been assurance in some way, shape or form provided to the plaintiff. Otherwise, the plaintiff would not have proceeded with the Trust Deed arrangement. The only evidence of such assurance is the plaintiff’s evidence that a phone call occurred to the effect canvassed earlier (see [36] above). Indeed, Ms Tiolani’s email dated 20 November 2014, which is reproduced at [37] above, refers to such a phone call, thereby strongly suggesting that the phone call did occur; the defendants have not explained how this email reconciles with their denial of the said phone call being made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Thus, on balance, I am persuaded that the said phone call did occur on 20 November 2014. I am also persuaded as to the plaintiff’s account on the contents of the phone call, specifically that the second defendant made, as a form of assurance, the two representations pleaded by the plaintiff (see [61] and [62] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 However, the plaintiff’s claim for misrepresentation is defective on multiple counts. I address first an obvious and fatal flaw to the plaintiff’s claims under both the First and Second Representations: they are both statements pertaining to <span class="font-italic">future </span>events.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the relevant representations implied a factum or faciendum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 The seminal pronouncement in Singapore on the requirements of an <span class="font-italic">actionable misrepresentation</span> remains the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>”). Specifically, the court noted at [21], citing Andrew Phang’s <span class="font-italic">Law of Contract (Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> (1998) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 … A representation… relates to some existing fact or some past event. It implies a <span class="font-italic">factum</span>, not a <span class="font-italic">faciendum</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">since it contains no element of futurity it must be distinguished from a statement of intention</span>. An affirmation of the truth of a fact is different from a promise to do something <span class="font-italic">in futuro</span>, and produces different legal consequences. This distinction is of practical importance. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 The Court of Appeal’s pronouncement on this point of law has been reiterated on numerous occasions: see for example <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1310 at [93], and more recently, <span class="font-italic">Zuraimi bin Mohamed Dahlan and another v Zulkarnine B Hafiz and another </span>[2020] SGHC 219 at [51]–[52]. There is a crucial distinction between actionable misrepresentations and a <span class="font-italic">future promise or statement of intention</span>. A claim involving the latter (future promises or statements of intention)<span class="font-italic"> </span>should manifest as a claim in, for example, breach of contract, and not misrepresentation. The critical question to be asked would be whether the statement of intention or the alleged future promise amounts to a binding, enforceable agreement. But what is clear from the authorities is that such statements involving a “<span class="font-italic">faciendum</span>” and not a “<span class="font-italic">factum</span>” cannot constitute an actionable misrepresentation. Only false statements as to present fact can constitute the subject matter of a misrepresentation claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Here, both representations clearly involve statements of intention or statements pertaining to future events:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The First Representation is that the Mall is a valuable mall that <span class="font-italic">can be sold</span>, and the shareholders paid back if necessary. This was a prospective statement. The commercial considerations undergirding the exchange in which the First Representation was purportedly made are important. This was not simply a statement on the value of the Mall and whether it was a liquid asset (which, in any event, would not have been a false statement; see [190] below). In context, this was a statement of assurance that <span class="font-italic">at some point of time in the future, should the need arise (if, say, the Chinamall Project did not come to fruition), the Mall can be liquidated, and the proceeds used to repay the plaintiff and other investors</span>. In any event, this statement cannot be said to be false because any valuable asset can always be sold; it is always a question of the sale price offered. If the sale price is lowered enough to be sufficiently attractive, some buyer will step forward to take advantage of the low price so as to make a profit subsequently.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Second Representation was a request for a three-month extension on the maturity date. This, however, is again a predictive statement that clearly pertains to an event in the future. It was a request that conveyed, somewhat impliedly, that with sufficient time, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">might</span> be able to obtain returns on his investment. It is therefore a statement contemplating a possible or probable future event, and not a present certainty. This statement did not, and could by no means, convert the plaintiff’s commercial investment, which had inherent risks of failure, into a guaranteed return when given a three-month time extension.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, in context, these representations constituted nothing more than statements on future events. They did not constitute false statements as to a <span class="font-italic">present state of affairs</span> at the time of their making; the plaintiff has not demonstrated this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Nor did these representations constitute legally binding <span class="font-italic">terms</span> as between the defendants and the plaintiff. If the plaintiff wanted to ensure that he would have security for his investment in the form of the Mall (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the subject matter of the First Representation), he ought to have negotiated with the defendants and stipulated this as <span class="font-italic">a term</span> in the Trust Deed, or demanded that the defendants include such terms in their agreement with Midas. The plaintiff did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 As for the Second Representation, the defendants rightly point out in written closing submissions that the plaintiff’s evidence is that he signed the Trust Deed on 20 November 2014, immediately after the phone call with the second defendant. At this point in time, there was no agreed fixed maturity date on the investment.

</div>
</div>
</div> This is why, in Ms Tiolani’s email sent the same day, she requested the new maturity date to be stipulated in writing by the defendants (see [37] above). The second defendant did not offer any assurance in response. Accordingly, at the time of the signing of the Trust Deed and even thereafter, the new 28 February 2015 “maturity date” was not a legally binding term. If the plaintiff had insisted on the parties agreeing to such a term, and if the parties did agree as such, the plaintiff would have then been able to pursue a cause of action in breach of contract. But the plaintiff failed to negotiate for such a term at the time of contract, and he cannot now rely on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 There were also other courses of action available to the plaintiff. Apart from the possibility of insisting on concrete terms being added to the Trust Deed, the plaintiff could have refused to sign the Trust Deed, and thereafter commenced an action claiming that Midas and/or the defendants repudiated the Investment Agreement and/or Convertible Loan Note to the plaintiff’s detriment. He chose not<span class="font-italic"> </span>to do so. I have alluded to this point earlier. The plaintiff chose to take into account the prospective statements made by the plaintiff in the 20 November 2014 phone call, which were <span class="font-italic">not </span>legally binding statements, and thereafter signed the Trust Deed. He made these decisions because he wished to persist with his investment, and obtain significant returns from, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the 20% interest rate. The plaintiff made these decisions in his capacity as an investor and businessman; he was no babe in the woods. The plaintiff’s failure to reserve his <span class="font-italic">legal </span>position has precluded him of a contractual claim, and this is of his own doing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 My analysis above has the consequence that the plaintiff’s claims under both common law fraudulent misrepresentation and the Misrepresentation Act are untenable. For completeness, I make several important observations on the second defendant’s behaviour and whether it was fraudulent in nature, since this forms the essence of the plaintiff’s allegations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the second defendant acted fraudulently</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In my view, there is insufficient evidence that the second defendant fraudulently made the two pleaded representations. In other words, I do not accept that the second defendant knew that the facts represented in the statements he made were false at the time of making, and despite this proceeded to make the relevant representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 As regards the First Representation, there is no evidence that the Mall was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a valuable asset. The undisputed evidence is that the Mall was recently (in the course of the Chinamall Project) transacted for at least RM100m.

</div> There is also no reason to believe that the Mall could not have been eventually sold as a valuable asset, in satisfaction of the debts owed by Midas to the first defendant and/or the investors – the plaintiff has not offered evidence demonstrating this, and, as mentioned, the Mall had in fact been transacted recently, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when Midas purchased the Mall.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As for the Second Representation, I am of the view that the second defendant acted in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> fashion when he made this statement on 20 November 2014.

</div> He was caught in the middle, trying to salvage the situation for all the investors and to ensure that Midas did not face a fatal insolvency situation at that point in time.

Counsel for the plaintiff has not been able to identify, with any precision, why the second defendant should be regarded as having acted in his own interests to the exclusion of the plaintiff’s (or for that matter, the interests of all the investors). The second defendant was trying to make good the Chinamall Project for the benefit of all investors and himself. It bears reiterating that the defendants had skin in the game as well; they had invested sums into the Chinamall Project and in Midas for the purpose of keeping the Chinamall Project afloat (see [49]–[50] above). It was in everybody’s interests for the project to succeed. With this context in mind, I am persuaded that the second defendant had simply conveyed to the plaintiff what was, to him, reasonable in the circumstances. He was providing an opinion on what was, in his view, a realistic subsequent maturity date for the investment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a time frame in which the Chinamall Project could possibly have been made good.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 This may at first blush appear to run against the grain of what was stated in the OT Letter (no fixed maturity date; see [31(c)] above). But two points are relevant. First, on the plaintiff’s case, the second defendant <span class="font-italic">requested </span>an extension of three months and did not make any firm promise that the investment would surely mature and come good in three months. Second, it would have been clear to the plaintiff in the circumstances that the second defendant was not making any firm implied promise that the plaintiff’s investment would <span class="font-italic">definitely</span> come good in three months. The OT Letter had been produced to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would have seen the lack of a fixed maturity date. This is exactly why he implored Ms Tiolani to obtain the second defendant’s confirmation on an alternative (the three-month timeframe). He knew that the Second Representation was not binding. It thus would have been clear to all involved that at best, the second defendant was conveying a rough and ready estimate of when the plaintiff would see returns on his investment if he (the plaintiff) opted to give Midas time to reverse its fortunes with respect to the Chinamall Project. I am accordingly unpersuaded that the second defendant made the Second Representation fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 With my discussion as stated above, there is no need to discuss in detail the other ancillary issues relating to <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the issue of reliance on the relevant representations. I simply note that the defendants have correctly raised <span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction</span> ([70] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) – the plaintiff had sight of the relevant investment contractual instruments, and his conduct as discussed above reveals that none of the alleged misrepresentations were operative on his mind. Specifically, the plaintiff knew that the relevant representations were <span class="font-italic">not</span> binding terms; I have explained this at [185], [186] and [193] above. <span class="font-italic">Despite </span>the lack of binding terms as a form of assurance/security, and despite the representations clearly being prospective statements that could by no means guarantee the success of the Chinamall Project, the plaintiff decided that the investment was worth the risk. In my view, these circumstances show that the plaintiff followed through with the signing of the Trust Deed <span class="font-italic">based on</span><span class="font-italic"> his</span> <span class="font-italic">own commercial judgment</span>. The plaintiff thus cannot be said to have relied on the alleged misrepresentations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 On the several bases indicated above, the plaintiff’s claims under both common law fraudulent misrepresentation and statutory misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act must fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 As noted earlier, while the agency relationship at present lent itself to the defendants being able to unilaterally bind the plaintiff and change the nature of his investment in the Chinamall Project upon consent of the majority, the defendants did not exercise this power (see [145] and [145] above). I thus confine my discussion on fiduciary duties to the defendants’ acts of dispensing advice to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 I will consider each of the alleged instances of breach, as pleaded in the Statement of Claim, in turn.

First and foremost, the second defendant’s evidence was consistent throughout trial, and I found him to be a credible witness. Further, his story adds up, and in my view, there is no other way to explain why the second defendant did what he did. All of the investors in the Chinamall Project, the plaintiff and the defendants included, were facing a perilous situation. If the Tans pulled the plug at that juncture (which eventually materialised with the insolvency event that Midas faced), everybody stood to lose their investments.

</div> This required the cooperation of the Tans, who were issuing threats at that point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 There was also no reason for the defendants to believe that the Chinamall Project was wholly unviable at that point.

The second defendant acted as he thought necessary to surmount this hurdle.

In fact, as pointed out, the first defendant was placed in an even worse position as it had put up, to its own detriment, an indemnity in favour of Mr Tan Chong Whatt. The benefit derived from the defendants acceding to the Tans’ request was a benefit enjoyed by <span class="font-italic">all</span>: the continued cooperation of the Tans in the Chinamall Project, which was necessary for the success of the project.

</div> As mentioned, I found the second defendant to be a credible witness at trial. The plaintiff further argues that the facts pertaining to the difficulties with the Tans that the second defendant faced were not pleaded. In a strict sense, the plaintiff might be correct, in that these facts were not specifically stated in the defendants’ pleadings. However, I am of the view that the essence of the defendants’ case has been sufficiently encapsulated in the Defence; the defendants have pleaded that they acted in the collective interest, specifically that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39. In any event, the Defendants aver in this respect that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) At the material time and under the relevant circumstances in Malaysia, notwithstanding that it had no duty to do so <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to the Noteholders, the 1st Defendant had acted reasonably and in accordance with the best interests of all the Noteholders in arranging for the re-documentation of the Aggregate Investment Sum…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64B. In any event, the Defendants aver that their collective investment in CHN and/or the Chinamall Project far exceeded that of the Plaintiff. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64C. Accordingly, the Defendants aver that, as fellow investors in CHN and/or the Chinamall Project, their interests and objectives were at all material times aligned with those of the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant is also taking steps to enforce the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement and/or to recover the Shareholder’s Loans on behalf of the Noteholders …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The above excerpts are broad enough, in my view, to encompass specific facts such as those raised by the second defendant at trial. A party cannot be expected to plead every single fact in detail. This would render the pleadings unwieldy and unreadable. The details of the parties’ cases often surface in their affidavit evidence and in-court testimony. This is unobjectionable. The “underlying consideration of the law of pleadings”, as stated recently by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fan Ren Ray and others v Toh Fong Peng and others </span>[2020] SGCA 117 (“<span class="font-italic">Fan Ren Ray</span>”), is “to prevent surprises arising at trial” (at [12]). While the court is generally “precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue” (which, in any event, is not the case here given that I find the defendants’ pleadings to be sufficient), a departure from this rule is permitted “where no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial” (<span class="font-italic">Fan Ren Ray</span> at [12]). In this respect, and importantly, the plaintiff had the opportunity to, and did, cross-examine the second defendant on his evidence. The plaintiff has therefore not been prejudiced by the mere fact that the minutiae of the defendants’ case was not expressly stated in the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 There is a separate issue, of course, of whether the second defendant ought to have been candid with the plaintiff about his difficulties with the Tans. I address this in the next section (see [218] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The next aspect of the plaintiff’s claim is the defendants’ failure to provide or procure alternative security for the plaintiff. Several points are fatal to the plaintiff’s claim. First, the issue of alternative security was in fact raised between the parties: see the parties’ correspondence as detailed at [26]–[39] above. After this correspondence, the plaintiff decided to go ahead with the Conversion. It cannot then be said that the defendants did not act in the plaintiff’s best interests, given that they had understood and addressed the plaintiff’s concerns.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The plaintiff then points to the First Representation and argues that this shows that the defendants did not adequately look out for his interests. My analysis in this respect closely mirrors my discussion on the plaintiff’s misrepresentation claims, which I will not repeat here. In short, I find that the second defendant made the First Representation in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> fashion. He did not act fraudulently and had no reason to believe that the Mall would not serve as valuable security. The plaintiff’s failure to negotiate and obtain further security in the course of the Conversion is of his own doing. If the plaintiff was dissatisfied, he ought not to have signed the Trust Deed. I accordingly consider there to be no breach of fiduciary duty by the defendants in this respect; even if there had been a breach due to their failure to procure further security, that breach would have been waived by the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">via</span> his acceptance of the Trust Deed in the prevailing circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Finally, as regards the OT Letter, the defendants accept that the “initial decision to do away with the maturity date was made without the [p]laintiff’s prior knowledge”.

</div> They however point out that this was eventually raised to the plaintiff prior to the plaintiff having signed the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In my view, a key point is that the decision taken by the defendants to do away with the initial maturity date was a commercially sound one in the circumstances, and one done <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> with the collective investors’ interests at heart. The second defendant gave unrefuted evidence that the Chinamall Project was not meeting its milestones and therefore a potential event of default might have arisen (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the investors would not have obtained returns on the promised maturity date). If that occurred, and any one of the investors decided to call on the default, the entire project would be put in jeopardy and “[e]verybody’s money will go down [the] drain”.

All of the investors were in a position where they were contractually entitled to returns on a fixed date, and they were then suddenly placed in a drastically different position. This, on its face, appears to be against the interests of the investors. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, I believe that the second defendant acted honestly, for reasons which mirror my analysis on the discharge of the Security Documents above. The defendants stood to incur the same detriment as the other investors, and they acted as they did because they genuinely believed it to be in the interests of the collective (which were aligned) in the long-term. Everybody wanted to see the Chinamall Project succeed. Accordingly, the defendants acted in good faith and their conscience was not affected; I see no breach in these circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Alternatively, and if I am wrong on the question of breach, I nonetheless find that in agreeing to the Trust Deed <span class="font-italic">after</span> being notified of the OT Letter, the plaintiff waived the defendants’ breach of duty. The defendants correctly point out that if the plaintiff was in fact under the impression that he was entitled to call on his investment on 28 November 2014, there would be correspondence to this effect. However, there is no evidence of such correspondence. This shows that the plaintiff knew he gave up his contractual entitlement to the initial maturity date and accepted the state of affairs created by the OT Letter. The plaintiff made concessions to this effect during trial.

The plaintiff was aware of this, as he was informed as such during the 20 November 2014 phone call. In so acting, the defendants were rendering advice to the best of their ability and in good faith. It is difficult to see what more the defendants could have offered given the prevailing circumstances, including <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the Tans’ intransigent position and Midas’ ailing financial health.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 More importantly, the plaintiff, as a businessman, was sufficiently aware of his predicament and there was no need for the defendants to dispense more advice than they did. I stress again that the plaintiff did not insist that the Mall be contractually stipulated as security. The plaintiff was clearly aware of the significance of such a contractual stipulation, seeing how he was concerned by the lack of reference to the Security Documents in the Trust Deed. The plaintiff did not insist on the contractual stipulation and that was his doing. There was no further need for the defendants to dispense him any more advice in this regard; he is an experienced businessman who knows better, and the defendants were aware of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In other words, the fact that the plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in the defendants to dispense good and accurate advice to him does not obviate the need for him, where clearly sensible, to think for himself and make his own decisions where necessary. Equity and the law on fiduciaries protect principals like the plaintiff in circumstances where they are vulnerable, but equity is not paternalistic and will not intervene when a party clearly has the capacity and opportunity to take steps to preserve its own position. The plaintiff could have but did not reserve his own position. In these circumstances, I do not accept that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to act loyally and in the plaintiff’s best interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 There is a separate critical point. Paragraph 51(b) of the Statement of Claim (the unilateral discharge of the Security Documents), which falls under the first category of alleged breaches, is also partly relevant on the issue of advice. The question is whether the defendants’ failure to <span class="font-italic">timeously</span><span class="font-italic"> disclose the true circumstances of the Tans’ behaviour and the 18 August 2014 Letter, and to advise the plaintiff on the same</span>, constituted a breach of their fiduciary duties. Put another way, the question is whether it would have been in the plaintiff’s best interests for the defendants to have simply placed the full picture before him and let him make his own decisions at that point as to whether he wished to proceed with the investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 This presents a difficult issue given that it has to do with the extent to which equity permits the fiduciary (agent) to determine what would be a “better” course of action for the principal. Indeed, there is a compelling argument to be made that fiduciaries in the shoes of the defendants ought to be obliged to act at all times with <span class="font-italic">full candour</span> and present <span class="font-italic">all</span> relevant information to the principal, even if such information appears to be minutiae at first glance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 On the unique facts of the present case, I am persuaded that in withholding from the plaintiff the information on the Tans’ conduct and the 18 August 2014 Letter (or for that matter, the 26 July 2014 MOA), the defendants did not act in breach of their duty to act loyally and in the investors’ best interests. This is because the defendants were attempting to balance the interests of all the investors they advised, <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> (noting that these interests were for all and intents and purposes aligned; all the investors wished to make a profit out of the Chinamall Project). The defendants feared an “outlier” situation where, despite the agreement of all the other investors, one investor would decide to withhold consent and call an event of default on 28 November 2014. If that happened, there would have likely been little to no chance of <span class="font-italic">anybody</span> recovering their principal investment sum, let alone any profits. The best possible outcome, in the defendants’ view and as evinced by their conduct, was for the investors to collectively see the project through and ride out the storm together. That was the best, if not the only, chance of all parties involved achieving a positive outcome. The defendants thus decided that to withhold the information on the Tans’ conduct and the 18 August 2014 Letter/26 July 2014 MOA would be in the collective’s best interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I emphasise, also, that while the defendants may have been somewhat economical with the truth in the limited sense indicated above, they did not convey falsehoods. The reasons they <span class="font-italic">did</span> provide for the Proposed Conversion and the Conversion (such as compliance with Malaysia’s legislative provisions) were valid; the plaintiff has not shown that the defendants were dishonest in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 In the light of the foregoing circumstances, I do not accept that the defendants breached their duty to act loyally and in the investors’ interests. I stress that my observations on this particular issue are limited to the unique facts of the present case, as informed by the multipartite relationship formed between Midas, the defendants, the plaintiff and the other investors. Importantly, the plaintiff was aware of this arrangement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there were more than a dozen investors involved, when he agreed to the Trust Deed. He was thus cognisant of the collective interests at stake. This unique factual matrix, in my view, resolves in favour of the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conflict of interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I now consider the plaintiff’s argument that the defendants were in a position of conflict by virtue of the second director being a director in Midas. The plaintiff’s own position is that the second defendant’s appointment as a director of the Midas was “solely for the purposes of safeguarding the interest of the investors of the Chinamall Project”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 This premise is critical. In my view, it puts paid to the plaintiff’s contention that the second defendant was in a position of conflict. By the plaintiff’s own admission, the appointment of the second defendant as a director of Midas was <span class="font-italic">aligned with the investors’ interests</span>. I accordingly do not see how this can in any sense be described as a position where the second defendant was conflicted. In acting (as he was obliged to) in the best interests of Midas and ensuring that Midas remained a going concern in order to successfully execute the Chinamall Project, the second defendant would have been acting in the investors’ interests. It must be borne in mind that Midas was always intended to be a <span class="font-italic">special purpose vehicle</span> to be used for the purpose of the Chinamall Project (see [9] above). Midas’ interests were thus fully aligned with the investors’ interests. I can see no conflict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 The plaintiff has not shed any further light on this or shown how its claim can be viable.

</div> This does not aid his case on conflict of interest.

</div> When the second defendant discovered this, Midas was in the deep. The second defendant then made extensive efforts to make good a bad predicament, and attempted to remedy the situation <span class="font-italic">in the interests of Midas and the investors</span> – I have canvassed this in detail at [42]–[47] above. All the evidence suggests that the second defendant acted in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> manner throughout. His conscience was never affected. He acted at all times for the benefit of the investors and to keep Midas afloat – these were consonant objectives that did not require the second defendant to place one side’s interests over the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 For completeness, I also do not consider that the defendants stood in conflict in the sense that they acted for their own interests to the exclusion of the plaintiff’s. The defendants were not trying to rescue the Chinamall Investment for their own sake. They did so for all involved. This is the second defendant’s consistent evidence. It is also telling that even when Midas was in deep water, the defendants continued injecting <span class="font-italic">personal </span>funds into the Chinamall Project and/or Midas with the hope of resuscitating the project, at their <span class="font-italic">own </span>expense (see [50]–[51] above). This was <span class="font-italic">after </span>the investors had already made their respective investments, and after the defendants were made aware of the difficulties Midas was facing. Relevant also is the indemnity extended by the first defendant to Mr Tan Chong Whatt. This is demonstrative of good faith on the defendants’ part. As a consequence of the sums the defendants injected in the Chinamall Project and their attempt to salvage Midas, the second defendant lost almost all of his life savings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 I accordingly reject the plaintiff’s claim that the second defendant stood in a position of conflict. This contention is wholly without merit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of contractual duties as agent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 This claim, as clarified, is primarily contractual. The tortious aspect of the plaintiff’s claims is considered under the section on “<span class="font-underline">Negligence</span>” below, from [242] onwards. The plaintiff’s contractual claim for breach of duties as agent is rooted in the alleged Agency Agreement. For reasons provided earlier, the Agency Agreement is not the relevant contractual document to scrutinise – instead, it is the ASTD. In scrutinising the defendants’ conduct, the relevant timeframe to consider is from the execution of the Investment Documents (28 November 2013) up to the date of discharge of the ASTD (20 November 2014). The relevant ASTD terms include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the implied duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the sub-provisions of clause 4.1 of the ASTD, which are in essence notification obligations and duties to provide the plaintiff timely information and advice (see [120] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasonable skill, care and diligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 The particulars of the defendants’ alleged breach of their duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence are found in the same portions of the Statement of Claim that concern the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty (see [197] and [198] above). Relevant, also, is paragraph 50 of the Statement of Claim, wherein the plaintiff highlights, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendants’ conduct in sending the 19 November 2013 email, providing the Term Sheet and making several representations on the nature of the investment in the Chinamall Project;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the fact that the Term Sheet’s provisions and the defendants’ representations differed from the actual terms of the Investment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff describes the above as the defendants’ failure to “confirm the true nature of the Chinamall Project before advising the [p]laintiff on the same”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 I have explained that the defendants at all times acted in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>manner and in the interests of the investors as a whole. This may be evinced from how the defendants constantly endeavoured to find a workable solution for the Chinamall Project and took steps to that effect. Of course, acting loyally and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>may not always be readily equated to having acted <span class="font-italic">with due diligence</span>. The inquiries are different; the key question for the latter is whether, in doing as they did, the defendants acted as a reasonable agent in the defendants’ shoes would have (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.014 citing McNair J in <span class="font-italic">Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee </span>[1957] 1 WLR 582). This, inevitably, is a fact-sensitive inquiry (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 07.014).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The observations in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at paragraph 07.015 are pertinent: not every error of judgment by an agent will be considered negligent. There can be no guarantee that absolutely no mistakes will be made by the agent; there may also well exist more than one reasonable view on an issue or a decision to be made. Just because the agent makes a decision that eventually turns out to be to the detriment of the principal does not mean the agent was negligent (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency </span>at paragraph 07.015 citing <span class="font-italic">Maynard v West Midlands</span><span class="font-italic"> Regional Health Authority </span>[1984] 1 WLR 634). The standard of care is whether the agent made an error that <span class="font-italic">no reasonably competent member of the profession would have made</span> (<span class="font-italic">Goh Teh Lee</span> ([97(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]). The courts have also emphasised the need to be slow to approach such matters with the benefit of hindsight (see <span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping</span> ([97(c)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The nature of the particular industry or market that the agent and principal are dealing in is also relevant; in particular, a more volatile commercial endeavour will affect the standard of care that the agent is held to. The observations of Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">OCBC Securities</span> ([97(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [40] are relevant. The court there noted that industries like the stock market are “well known to be unpredictable and any recommendation or advice therefore carries the inherent risk that it may be wrong”. Lee JC also observed, correctly in my view, that “[t]he fact that a recommendation turns out to be wrong does not mean it was negligent when it was given” (at [40]). While the present case does not involve the stock market <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">OCBC Securities</span> applies <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, in that the parties here were involved in a commercial investment that bore an inherent element of risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 With the above in mind, I do not consider that the defendants acted without reasonable skill, care and diligence. I explain with reference to the chronology of events. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When the defendants provided the initial information on the Chinamall Project <span class="font-italic">via</span> email and the Term Sheet, they simply provided whatever information was available to them at the time. The Investment Agreement turned out to have different terms. But the defendants provided the draft Investment Agreement to the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to his making of the investment. The plaintiff would thus have known of the difference in terms; he is not pleading <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. It cannot be then said that the defendants dispensed information and advice negligently.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Proposed Conversion is irrelevant, given that it was not executed. In any event, it is clear that the defendants simply conveyed the information they had to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not shown how the defendants’ conduct could be described as negligent in any sense.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) When it came to the Conversion, relevant aspects of the defendants’ conduct include the 20 November 2014 phone call with the plaintiff. In advising the plaintiff to follow through with the investment and providing verbal assurance on the value of the Mall, the defendants did not act negligently. The second defendant, in his judgment, gave advice that he thought would allow the plaintiff’s (and other investors’) investment to succeed. I do not find such conduct to be conduct that no other reasonable advisor in the second defendant’s shoes would have adopted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As regards all the events stated above, the defendants surely knew that there was an element of risk involved, and that their advice could by no means warrant or ensure the success of the plaintiff’s investment. But the plaintiff must have known this too. The Chinamall Project was a commercial investment that offered 20% <span class="font-italic">per </span>annum returns with a shorter-than-average maturity date. There had to be catches and risks in some way, shape or form. This adds an important and distinct complexion to the defendants’ advice, which reinforces my views in the preceding sub-paragraphs. With the prevalent risks in mind, I do not see how the defendants’ conduct and advice could be considered so wholly unreasonable such that no other investment agent in their shoes would have acted the same way. The plaintiff has not proven this.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) As regards the non-disclosures or late disclosures relating to the 26 July 2014 MOA, the 18 August 2014 Letter, the OT Letter and the discharge of the Security Documents, I have explained earlier that the defendants acted as they did because they genuinely believed it to be the best course of action for all involved. They acted deliberately, not carelessly or negligently. I found the second defendant’s testimony in this regard credible, and his evidence cogent. Importantly, I also do not consider these to be decisions that no other agent in the defendants’ shoes would have reasonably made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Timely advice and information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 As regard this set of obligations, as encompassed in clause 4.1 of the ASTD, I find that the defendants may have been in breach. Specifically, clause 4.1(c) of the ASTD states that the defendants must “promptly notify the Noteholders of any fact, circumstance or development which may affect the rights, interest or entitlements of the Noteholders or any of them”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The late disclosures of the OT Letter and the information on the discharge of the Security Documents are immaterial because they were disclosed before the plaintiff signed the Trust Deed. I am satisfied, on a commercially sensible construction of clause 4.1(c), that this key fact precludes liability on the defendants’ part. The defendants’ disclosure of the OT Letter and discharge of the Security Documents, while not “prompt” in an absolute sense, was <span class="font-italic">sufficiently prompt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and achieved the purpose of clause 4.1(c), which in my view is to ensure that the investors could make informed decisions on their investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 However, the defendants’ non-disclosure of the 26 July 2014 MOA and the 18 August 2014 Letter fell foul of the obligations under clause 4.1 of the ASTD. The 26 July 2014 MOA and the 18 August 2014 Letter clearly fall under “any fact, circumstance or development which may affect the rights, interest or entitlements [of the investors]”. These documents went to the very basis of the investments and the security that protected the investments. The defendants ought to have disclosed these documents to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 That said, I find that these were <span class="font-italic">technical breaches </span>that did not cause the plaintiff loss. Similar information, which encapsulated the essence of the 26 July 2014 MOA and the 18 August 2014 Letter, had been disclosed in the Trust Deed, the OT Letter and the correspondence pursuant to these documents. By virtue of the disclosure of these documents, the plaintiff was equipped with sufficient information to make an informed decision, and did make an informed decision, in signing the Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 It may be asked, “would the plaintiff had acted differently if the 26 July 2014 MOA and the 18 August 2014 Letter, and the circumstances surrounding these documents, had been disclosed before the plaintiff signed the Trust Deed?” Put another way, if the plaintiff had been apprised of the difficulty that the second defendant experienced with the Tans, would he have chosen to exit the investment early? The evidence adduced by the parties on this specific point is scant. In my view, the plaintiff would not have acted differently. By his own case, the plaintiff trusted the defendants’ judgment calls. He did not want to be bothered by trivial details and focussed only on the key aspects of the investment, such as the presence of security. This is why he asked Ms Tiolani to follow up on the issue of security, and was satisfied enough, in his own judgment, to proceed to sign the Trust Deed once the First Representation was made. He trusted the defendants’ judgment for all other matters. Thus, in the hypothetical scenario where the defendants did disclose the 26 July 2014 MOA, the 18 August 2014 Letter and the trouble with the Tans, I am persuaded that, on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff would have still proceeded with his investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Accordingly, even if the defendants fully complied with clause 4.1(c) of the ASTD, and disclosed the relevant information and documents, the plaintiff would not have been in any better position. There is accordingly no loss occasioned by the defendants’ failure to provide timely information in this respect. I thus dismiss this aspect of the plaintiff’s claim as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 I have explained why the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to act with reasonable skill, care and diligence in their dealings (see [167]–[173] above). But that is not the end of the inquiry. The critical question that follows is whether, by rendering the advice that they did and taking the various steps in the course of the Chinamall Project, the defendants breached their duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 My analysis in this regard mirrors largely my discussion above on the contractual duty of reasonable skill, diligence and care, for self-evident reasons. The principles espoused in case law and in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span>, as reproduced at [232]-–[234] above, apply with equal force to common law negligence and contractual duties of skill, care and diligence. The factors in the tortious and contractual inquiries are cut from the same cloth. I accordingly do not consider that the defendants breached their duty of care by virtue of the events transpiring between 28 November 2013 and 20 November 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 I also do not accept that the defendants breached their duties thereafter. Far from it, the defendants went over and above the call of duty. When the Chinamall Project was taking a turn for the worse, the defendants continued to liaise with the plaintiff, and attempted to salvage the situation. They did not pack their bags and abandon the investors. They liaised with all parties involved, and spared no expense when Midas was at the end of the road and facing a winding up order (see [42]–[47] above). They also injected their personal funds into Midas and the Chinamall Project when the tides had already turned unfavourably.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 For these reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s claim in negligence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dishonest assistance by the second defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Given that I have found against the plaintiff on all the aforementioned issues, in particular the issue of fiduciary duties, there is strictly speaking no need to consider whether the second defendant dishonestly assisted the first defendant’s various alleged breaches. The doctrine of dishonest assistance is premised on the defaulting party <span class="font-italic">assisting in a primary wrong</span>, typically a breach of fiduciary duty. But as explained in the preceding paragraphs, there is no primary wrong on the first defendant’s part to begin with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 In any event, the element of dishonesty in dishonest assistance would not be made out. For the reasons provided earlier, I do not believe that the second defendant’s conscience was affected in any way during his course of dealing with the plaintiff. He acted at all times in the investors’ collective best interests and towards the successful completion of the Chinamall Project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 I emphasise in closing that I have found the defendants to be credible and honest parties in their involvement in the Chinamall Project. This is based on my assessment of the second defendant at trial. In my view, the defendants acted in a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> manner throughout, and were never in cahoots with Midas and its associates. The defendants put their money where their mouths were by making direct investments in the Chinamall Project. They acted, at all times, with the purpose of seeing the project to fruition. Even when the situation appeared bleak upon the winding up order being made against Midas, the defendants spared no expense and attempted to redeem what looked to be a lost cause, albeit to no avail. They also acted, at all times, with the skill, care and diligence expected of agents in their trade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 This case is unfortunate in that there was an ostensible wrongdoing perpetrated, and consequent losses occasioned, by <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> Midas’ liquidator and the Tans; but the defendants cannot be held accountable for a wrong they did not commit. One must also recognise that investments such as the Chinamall Project inevitably involve risk; indeed, the high promised returns of about 20% interest <span class="font-italic">per </span>annum were a tell-tale sign of a corresponding risk. The plaintiff gambled, and it did not pay off. Whilst I sympathise with the plaintiff’s position in the light of the financial loss he has suffered, the defendants are not at fault; they, too, suffered loss that was not insignificant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 I therefore dismiss the plaintiff’s claims in their entirety. Unless the parties wish to be heard on costs, I order costs against the plaintiff in favour of the defendants to be taxed if not agreed. If the parties wish to be heard, they are to (a) inform the court of this intention within seven days from the date of this Judgment and work with the registry in determining a suitable hearing date; and (b) file, within 14 days from the date of this Judgment, succinct written submissions on costs limited to 15 pages each (inclusive of any relevant annexes).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Hwee Khiam Anthony and Huineng Clement Chen (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Siraj Omar <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Allister Brendan Tan, Teng Po Yew, Joelle Tan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
