<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
case, at its simplest, is one of a borrower who took out a loan
to buy properties and to invest and now refuses or is unable to
pay it back. It is complicated by the mechanisms within the loan,
for example, the different currencies that denominate the different
tranches of the loan, as well as the different triggers that set
off related calls on the loan but, at its heart, it is a case of
a borrower who is facing a claim from the bank and seeking a declaration
to absolve himself of his debts. In attempting to do so, the plaintiff
has mounted a multi-pronged attack on the contract he signed on, claiming,
among other things, that the contract is void for uncertainty and that
there are multiple difficulties in the construction of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having
considered the evidence and the parties’ three sets of written submissions
tendered sequentially after the trial, I have decided to dismiss the
Plaintiff’s claim and to allow the Defendant’s counterclaim. I now
give the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
plaintiff, Jason Glenn Edwards (“Edwards”) is an Australian citizen
who has lived in Singapore for 6 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He
is General Counsel at Clearwater Capital Partners<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, a firm in the business of private equity
and fund management.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He
was previously a partner at the law firm, Baker and McKenzie.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It
is not in dispute that Edwards is a financially astute and sophisticated
customer who was proactive in buying and selling instrument funds
as well as booking forward currency conversions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> His
income is paid to him in either USD or SGD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
defendant, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (“ANZ”),
is an international banking group operating in Singapore. ANZ provides
banking and financial services, including deposits services and loan
facilities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Edwards
testified at the trial. An Australian property valuer who did a valuation
of 61 George Street in Queensland (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> below),
one of the properties in issue here, and an Australian estate agent
engaged by the previous owner of 61 George Street to sell the said
property in January 2008 were supposed to testify at the trial via
video-link. However, it was agreed at the start of the trial that
their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) be admitted without
cross-examination but would be subject to submissions to be made.
The witnesses who appeared for ANZ at the trial were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ms Jodene
Frances Edwards (“Jodene Frances”), a former employee of ANZ in
Singapore from 2004 - June 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> She
is a former Private Banker in ANZ, specializing in the sale of dual
and multi-currency facilities. She met Edwards sometime before January 2006
in her capacity as private banker after he was referred to her by one
of her colleagues.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Malcolm
George Crispe (“Crispe”), an ANZ Associate Director of Private Banking
at ANZ. He dealt with Edwards after Edwards’ account was transferred
to him from Jodene Frances in April 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Crispe
was Edwards’ Relationship Manager till April 2009, when Edwards’
account was transferred to the Asset Management Unit of ANZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Maya
Lim, the Senior Manager, Lending Services Asia of ANZ. He dealt
with Edwards from 20 April 2010 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Similarly,
an Australian valuer engaged by ANZ to do a retrospective valuation
of 61 and 75 George Street (the latter being the other property
in issue here- see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> below)
was also supposed to have testified via video-link. His AEIC was
also admitted by consent without cross-examination but subject to
submissions to be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The promising start</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In
2006, Edwards wanted to purchase property in Australia and, to this
end, wanted to borrow and make mortgage payments in the currency
of his income or alternatively in a low interest currency like the
Japanese Yen. He sought to avoid having to convert his income into
Australian Dollars to make his mortgage payments because if the
Australian Dollar appreciated against the currency he was paid in,
the cost of his monthly payments would rise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He
also found borrowing in Japanese Yen not too “burdensome” as the
interest rate was low.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
January 2006, ANZ advertised a package that appeared to be perfectly
suited to Edwards’ needs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> It
featured the ability to borrow in income currency and/or property
currency and the flexibility to switch in between.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
24 January 2006, Edwards signed a facility letter for a Multi Currency
Term Loan Facility (“the Facility Letter”). Funds were made available
to Edwards in Japanese Yen (“JPY”), Singapore Dollars (“SGD”), Australian
Dollars (“AUD”) and US Dollars (“USD”). ANZ’s Standard Terms and
Conditions (“the T&amp;Cs”) were issued as part of the Facility Letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
stated purpose of the facility was to refinance an existing loan with
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Hong Kong, for a property located at 75
George Street, Burleigh Heads, Queensland, Australia (“75 George Street”),
for investment purposes, and to finance the purchase of a residential
property located in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Facility Letter was subsequently
varied by variation letters dated: 22 March 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>,
13 April 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, 27 July 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>,
21 August 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, 10 December 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, 14 July 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and
23 October 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> (collectively,
“the Variation Letters”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The
Facility Letter, Variation Letters and the T&amp;Cs together formed
the entire facility agreement (“the Facility Agreement”) entered
into between Edwards and ANZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I
draw particular attention here to the 14 July 2008 variation letter
(“the 14 July letter”). It is of central importance in this trial and
almost the entirety of the trial was spent on interpreting the clauses
in the 14 July letter (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> – <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The purchase of 61 George Street</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In
July 2008, Edwards wanted to purchase 61 George Street Central, Burleigh
Heads, Queensland 4220 (“61 George Street”). He sought a variation
of the existing loan facility to obtain additional loan funds in order
to assist in financing the purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> On
14 July 2008, Edwards signed the 14 July letter which set out how
much funds would be made available to Edwards and what securities
ANZ wanted from Edwards. It also set out terms relating to the Loan
to Security Ratio (“LVR”) and terms relating to the consequences
of breaching certain LVRs (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> below
for the exact terms). On or about 25 July 2008, Edwards drew down
on the new facility. The amount required was AUD 1,714,879.11, of
which Edwards requested that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     AUD
1,000,000 be converted to JPY, with the resulting loan being JPY
103,709,000;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     AUD
714,879.11 be converted to USD, with the resulting loan being USD
688,078.29.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As
of or about 25 July 2008, Edwards’ total loan principal under the Facility
Agreement (“the Total Loan Principal”) was:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     AUD
269,073.04;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     JPY
180,297,938; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     USD
997,148.29.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">LVR exceeds 80%</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On
7 October 2008, the LVR was in excess of 80%, a stipulated threshold
in the Facility Agreement (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> below).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> On
10 October 2008, Crispe informed Edwards via email that a call had
been triggered on the remaining loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Crispe
asked that Edwards call him to discuss his options. Crispe also
attached to the email:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     A
letter dated 9 October 2008 by Michael Byers, the Head of Risk and
Compliance, Private Banking, Asia, by which ANZ informed Edwards
that: LVR was in excess of 90% and that Edwards was required to
either (1) provide additional security of a pledged cash deposit
of an amount not less than AUD 1,139,000; (2) reduce the loan outstanding
by AUD 1,025,000; or (3) provide other security that would be acceptable
to ANZ by 20 October 2008. If he did not do either of the three,
ANZ would exercise its right to convert Edwards’ loan outstandings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
spreadsheet summarising Edwards’ position, containing the value
of the securities, the amount of loan outstandings, the maximum
approved LVR and the amount of payment that needed to be made by
Edwards to cure the LVR breach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Edwards proposes to repay loans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
10 October 2008, Edwards responded that he wanted to:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     liquidate
the funds that were being used as security for the facility;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     repay

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     make

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>not</em> have the loans converted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On
or about 24 October 2008, Edwards’ LVR was still in excess of 80%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> On
31 October 2008, Edwards informed Crispe via email that he had set
up the standing instruction to transfer USD 10,000 a month, beginning
3 November 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> On
or around 6 November 2008, USD 10,000 was received by ANZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first conversion (JPY to
AUD)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On
17 November 2008, Crispe informed Edwards over the phone that ANZ
had decided to convert all loan outstandings to AUD, as LVR was
in excess of 90%. Edwards expressed disappointment and stressed
that he had the capacity to make payment to reduce the loan outstandings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
email replies on 18 November 2008, Edwards reiterated his proposals
to avoid conversion. He proposed to pay the AUD loan with:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     at
least USD 200,000 from his bonus;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     proceeds
from the sale of his Thai property; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     proceeds
from the sale of the Series 11 Fund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     He
also proposed to reduce the USD portion of the loan from approximately
USD 997,000 to USD 350,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> He
would then continue to pay USD 10,000 each month and add to these
monthly payments to make sure the rest of the USD loan was repaid
in full in less than two years. These proposed payments would leave
him with the JPY portion outstanding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In
an email dated 18 November 2008, Crispe informed Edwards that the
JPY loan would be converted to AUD but Edwards could retain the USD
portion of the loan on the basis that USD 500,000 would be repaid
by March 2009, with USD 300,000 paid from the proceeds of sale of
the Thai property and USD 200,000 from Edwards’ bonus. Upon conversion
of the JPY loan to AUD, the proceeds from the sale of the Series
11 Fund and term deposit of AUD 44,047.27 would be used to repay
part of the AUD loan, with the remaining AUD loan being AUD 2,635,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In response, Edwards’ sent an
email to Crispe the same day, proposing to pay an additional USD
300,000 to avoid the conversion of the JPY loan. Edwards stated
that he may have to seek a loan from his employer to raise the USD 300,000.
He stated that this proposal would bring the LVR down to 90% in
a few months, and following from that, he could repay the remaining loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On
19 November 2008, Crispe called Edwards to inform him that his proposal
was rejected. The JPY loan was to be converted but the USD portion
of the loan could be retained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> According
to a diary note prepared by Crispe, Edwards expressed his disappointment
over the JPY conversion and wanted to challenge the decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Crispe advised that the decision was
final and would not be reviewed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> On
20 November 2008, when the LVR stood at 120.93%, ANZ confirmed the
conversion of the JPY loan to AUD by way of email and written confirmations
which set out the amounts that were converted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> JPY
180,297,938.00 would be converted to AUD 2,962,518.97.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The
Actual conversions took place on 25 November 2008 (LVR at 119.6%),

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Between
December 2008 and April 2009, Edwards liquidated some of the security
that he had pledged to ANZ and used the funds to repay his loans.
He also made monthly repayments of USD 10,000.00 from November 2008
to March 2010, as proposed earlier (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> However,
he failed to make the USD 300,000 payment which was supposed to
come from the proceeds of sale of the Thai property and also did
not make repayments from his bonus, two repayments that were part
of the same proposal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> The
USD 10,000 payments were insufficient to reduce the loan significantly
and the LVR remained in excess of 90%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Crispe reminded
Edwards in an email of 3 March 2009 that the retention of the USD
portion of the loan was conditional on the payments coming from Edwards’
bonus and the proceeds of sale of the Thai property. Edwards replied
the same day via email, stating that his bonus was only USD 150,000 and
that it was payable in instalments. More importantly, Edwards demanded
to know what assurance ANZ would give him before he would commit
to repayment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This
case centres on the construction of 2 clauses which formed part of
the 14 July letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Edwards’
case was that the only real issue was whether the Variation Letter
gave ANZ the right to convert the denominations of the currency used
in the loans. He submitted that the Variation Letter clearly did
not give ANZ this right.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> In
deploying this argument, he assailed certain words in the two clauses
and argued, in the main, that the contract was uncertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Before
I begin on the issues, though, it would be useful to set out the law
that governs cases such as this which turn on the interpretation
of contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on contractual interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
interpretation of a contract is an objective exercise. This was made
clear by the Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich Insurance
(Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029; [2008] 3 SLR 1029 (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”), where the court (at
[131]) endorsed a summary of principles set out by Gerard McMeel
in his book, <em>The Construction of Contracts:
Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</em> (Oxford
University Press, 2007) (“<em>McMeel</em>”),
two of which I find useful to set out as a backdrop for the exercise
of construction that this case requires:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b><em>The aim of
construction</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the aim of the exercise of construction of a contract
or other document is to ascertain the meaning which it would convey
to a reasonable business person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b><em>The objective
principle</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the <em>objective principle</em> is
therefore critical in defining the approach the courts will take.
They are concerned usually with the expressed intentions of a person,
not his or her Actual intentions. The standpoint adopted is that of
a reasonable reader.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Lord
Steyn referred to this objective exercise in <em>Sirius
International Insurance Co (Publ) v FAI General Insurance Ltd and
others</em> [2004] UKHL 54 (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>-<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>), where he addressed the approach
to take when construing a commercial instrument:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The settlement contained in the Tomlin
order must be construed as a commercial instrument. The aim of the
inquiry is not to probe the real intentions of the parties but to
ascertain the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language. <b><em>The inquiry is objective: the question is what a reasonable
person, circumstanced as the Actual parties were, would have understood
the parties to have meant by the use of specific language.</em></b> The answer
to that question is to be gathered from the text under consideration and
its relevant contextual scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>There has been a
shift from literal methods of interpretation towards a more commercial
approach.</em></b> In <em>Antaios Compania Naviera
SA v Salen Rederierna AB</em>[1985] AC 191, 201 , Lord Diplock,
in an opinion concurred in by his fellow Law Lords, observed: <b><em>"if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of a
word in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that
flouts business common sense, it must be made to yield to business
common sense."</em></b> In <em>Mannai Investment
Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</em> [1997] AC 749,
771, I explained the rationale of this approach as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"<b><em>In determining the
meaning of the language of a commercial contract ... the law ...
generally favours a commercially sensible construction. The reason
for this approach is that a commercial construction is more likely
to give effect to the intention of the parties.</em></b> Words
are therefore interpreted in the way in which a reasonable commercial
person would construe them. And the standard of the reasonable commercial
person is hostile to technical interpretations and undue emphasis
on niceties of language."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b><em>The tendency should
therefore generally speaking be against literalism.</em></b> What
is literalism? It will depend on the context. But an example is given
in <em>The Works of William Paley</em> (1838
ed), vol III, p 60. The moral philosophy of Paley influenced thinking
on contract in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The
example is as follows: the tyrant Temures promised the garrison
of Sebastia that no blood would be shed if they surrendered to him.
They surrendered. He shed no blood. He buried them all alive. This
is literalism. If possible it should be resisted in the interpretative process.
This approach was affirmed by the decisions of the House in <em>Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance
Co Ltd</em> [1997] AC 749, 775 e-g, per Lord Hoffmann and
in <em>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West
Bromwich Building Society</em> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 913 d-e,
per Lord Hoffmann.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
objective nature of the inquiry as set out in the above case was referred
to in the Court of Appeal case of <em>The “Asia
Star”</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 1 (at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>).
I now turn to addressing the parties’ arguments. As will be seen, Edwards’
arguments were essentially in the same vein as the literalism Lord Steyn
cautioned against.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the terms in the 14 July
letter unknown?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This
was an argument that Edwards raised at a rather belated stage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Edwards
applied, on the second day of trial, to amend his pleadings to take this
argument into account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> He
argued that the 14 July letter was impossible to understand because
it varied a “mysterious facility letter dated 10 December 2007 whose
terms are unknown” (“the 10 December Facility Letter”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>. For
clarity, this was what the beginning of the 14 July letter stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to our facility letter dated 10 December
2007 (hereinafter shall be referred to as the “Facility Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further to your request for an additional
loan facility, we are pleased to revise the following clauses of
the Facility Letter. Terms defined and references construed in the
Facility Letter have the same meaning and structure in this letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Edwards
then argued that the terms of the 10 December Facility Letter were
essential to a proper understanding of the terms and structure of
the 14 July letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There
were two more documents that were referred to by the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     an
unsigned 10 December 2007 variation letter titled “Facility Letter
1” (“the unsigned letter”);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     another
10 December 2007 letter (“the second 10 December letter”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Crispe
testified that the unsigned letter that was produced in discovery
was <em>the</em> 10 December Facility Letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> ANZ’s
arguments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
10 December Facility Letter was immaterial to the interpretation
of Clauses 14 and 16.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
unsigned letter <em>was</em> the 10 December
Facility Letter that was referred to in the 14 July letter. ANZ
argued that though Edwards claimed to have signed a letter (meaning
that the unsigned letter could not be the letter referred to), he
did not deny that the unsigned letter bore the same terms as the
10 December Facility Letter which formed part of the facility arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
contents of the second 10 December letter and the evidence of Crispe
clarified that the second 10 December letter related to a separate
term loan facility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     This
contention regarding the referencing of the correct letters was
not a genuine contention but an afterthought that came up only during
trial. The contention did not appear anywhere in Edwards’ pleadings,
earlier affidavits or AEIC, despite the unsigned letter having been
disclosed by ANZ very early in the proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> The remedial
Action taken by Edwards’ was to seek to apply to amend his pleadings
on the second day of trial. This was dismissed by the court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As
I stated when I dismissed the application to amend during the trial, I
was of the view that it was incumbent on Edwards, having contested
that the letter was not the same one as the one he signed, to prove
his assertion by oral or documentary evidence. To continue to contend
that the unsigned letter was a mystery letter that <em>could</em> have
been a version different from the 10 December Facility Letter, in
and of itself and without proof, would be a venture into the realm
of speculation. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Ideally,
of course, I would have preferred to have had sight of a signed copy
of the 10 December Facility Letter. However, this was not produced and
Edwards’ inability to prove his assertion leaves me with the version
that ANZ has produced, the unsigned letter, which I take to contain
the contents of the 10 December Facility Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Construction of Clauses 14 and
16 of the 14 July letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
14 July letter was a document that both parties placed a great deal of
emphasis on. It was a variation letter sent to Edwards from ANZ’s
Head of Risk and Compliance for its Private Bank division, Michael
Byers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It
was explained by ANZ during the trial that the reference to “Clause 4”
in Clause 12(v) was Actually a reference to Clause 12(iv). Having
set out the relevant clauses, I now address the arguments relating
to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was ANZ only entitled to effect
a redenomination of Edwards’ loans upon a change of currency of
his income, by virtue of clause 16 being read with clause 14?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Edwards’
position is that, consistent with ANZ’s promotional material and
Edwards’ own understanding of the matter from the outset and the
clear terms of the 14 July letter, ANZ was only entitled to effect
a redenomination of Edwards’ loans upon a change of currency of
Edwards’ income.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In
support of this position, Edwards relies on the words “Subject to the
provisions in clause 14...” at the beginning of Clause 16 and argues
that the clear and obvious meaning of these words is that Clause
16 is subservient to Clause 14.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> He
argues that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     Any
limitations applicable to the dominant clause will apply equally
to the subservient clause.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause
14, the dominant clause, states that ANZ could <em>only</em> redenominate
loans upon a change in Edwards’ income currency.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause
16, being subservient, must be limited by the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     Accordingly,
because the currency of Edwards’ main income never changed, ANZ
did not have any right to redenominate his loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Edwards
argues that if it was intended that Clause 16 could provide for
redenomination in circumstances not envisaged by Clause 14, Clause
16 would have started with the words “Notwithstanding the provisions
in Clause 14” and not “Subject to the provisions in Clause 14”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     ANZ’s
position is that Edwards’ interpretation is ill fitting and submits
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
meaning of “Subject to the provisions in clause 14” in Clause 16
is that the rights or obligations in Clause 16 are subject to ANZ having
the rights that it has reserved in Clause 14.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause
14 is not a clause that sets out limitations or conditions on ANZ’s
rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I
agree with ANZ’s argument that Clause 14 is not a clause that sets out
limitations or conditions on ANZ’s rights. Firstly, clause 14 relates
to “General Conditions”. By this, I understand that the two rights
ANZ reserves to itself in Clause 14(a) and (b) are the right to
require the borrower to reduce the amount owing under the Facility
Agreement if LVR exceeded 80%, and the right to require Edwards
to redenominate the Facility into a different currency other than
USD/SGD/JPY upon a change in the currency of his main income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The
scenario envisioned in Clause 16 is a slightly different one. Here, the
event that is being considered is that of the outstanding loan amount being
denominated in a currency different from the currency of the Security.
When a scenario falls under this description, the clawback conditions
in Clause 16 will apply. The words “Subject to the provisions in clause
14...”, in my opinion, mean that ANZ retains the two rights in Clause 14
but <em>in </em><em>this
particular situation</em> of there being an outstanding loan amount
that is denominated in a currency different from the currency of the
Security, the clawback conditions in Clause 16 will apply. In a
sense, Clause 16 is a sub-specie of the general scenarios envisaged
in Clause 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Accordingly,
I do not agree with Edwards’ submission that ANZ was only entitled
to effect a redenomination of the loan upon a change of currency
of his income.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Problems with Clause 16(c)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For
ease of reference and understanding, I set out Clause 16(c) again. I
have emphasized the phrases in the clause which are the bone of contention
here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If such deposits and/or securities as provided
for in <b><em>CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 13(b)</em></b> above
are not received within 3 days of such demand, or should the loan
to security ratio exceeds 90% at any time, then the Bank at its
absolute discretion may immediately convert the <b><em>relevant amount</em></b> in <b><em>CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 13(a)</em></b> into
any currency (at the Bank’s then prevailing rate of exchange) that
the Bank deems fit in order to <b><em>fully eliminate
its foreign exchange risks</em></b>. All costs associated with
such conversion will be for the Borrower’s account. The Bank shall
also not be held responsible in any way if it chooses not to convert
at any level but instead continues to demand for additional securities
or if it chooses to convert when the loan to security ratio is higher
than 90%. Following any conversion, the loan to security ratio will
still have to be re-instated to 80%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Were the references to Clause
13(a) and (b) in Clause 16(c) typographical errors?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Edwards’
case is as follows: Clause 13(b) makes no reference to “additional
securities” that Edwards may be required to furnish to ANZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> Similarly, Clause 13(a) does not
refer to any relevant amount for any “CLAWBACK CONDITION”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> The only thing that is clear about Clause
16(c) is that it does not give ANZ the right to redenominate Edwards’
facilities in the manner that it did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     ANZ’s
case is that the references to “CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 13(a)”
and “CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 13(b)” in Clause 16(c) were typographical
errors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> ANZ
does not deny making a mistake in the references to Clause 13(a)
and (b).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> ANZ
argues that the correct references should be to “CLAWBACK CONDITION
– Clause 16(a)” and “CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 16(b)” respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     First,
Clause 16 is the only clause in the 14 July letter that is titled “CLAWBACK
CONDITION” and the inclusion of the phrase “CLAWBACK CONDITION”
in the erroneous references indicates clearly that Clause 16(c)
was referring to Clauses 16(a) and 16(b).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Second,
the terms “relevant amount” and “deposits and/or securities” are
not mentioned in Clause 13 at all. Clause 13 (titled “CONDITIONS PRECEDENT”)
deals with completely different subject matters and that makes it
even clearer that parties could not have intended the references
to be to Clauses 13(a) and 13(b), which provide that ANZ’s obligations
under the Facility Letter are subject to the bank receiving a copy
of the insurance for the two properties in issue and a copy of the
receipt evidencing full payment of Edwards’ equity portion for the
purchase of 61 George Street (wrongly stated as 64 George Street
in Clause 12(ii) and as 6 George Street in Clause 6). .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Third,
the initial facility letter of 24 January 2006 (“the Initial Facility Letter”)
that was signed by Edwards has the same “CLAWBACK CONDITION” clause
at Clause 16, where the references to the sub-clauses are correct.
Clause 16 of the Initial Facility Letter reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">16. CLAWBACK CONDITION</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the provisions in clause 14, in the event the outstanding
loan amount is denominated in a different currency to the currency
of the Security, the following clawback conditions will apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">For the purposes of this clause, the loan to security ratio

own prevailing rate(s)) into the currency that the Property is denominated
in, expressed as a proportion of the value of the assets held and
charged as Property by the Bank.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The term “currency that the Property is
denominated in” shall in the case where immovable property is concerned,
refer to the currency of the country in which the immovable property

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">* If there are more than two currencies

amount in a currency acceptable to the Bank equal to the excess
over a 55% loan to security ratio in a deposit account with the
Bank in the name of the Borrower but charged to the Bank and/or
provide to the Bank such additional securities, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank and in such value as the Bank may require,

as provided for in CLAWBACK CONDITION – Clause 16(b) above are not

may immediately convert the relevant amount in CLAWBACK CONDITION
– Clause 16(a) into any currency (at the Bank’s then prevailing

still have to be re-instated to 55%.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     ANZ
then submits that the court has the power to correct obvious mistakes
in the written expression of the intention of the parties and, once corrected,
the contract is interpreted in its corrected form.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I
find ANZ’s arguments on this matter persuasive. First, the clauses referred
to in Clause 16(c) were labelled “CLAWBACK CONDITION - 13(a)” and
“CLAWBACK CONDITION - 13(b) above”. In the 14 July letter, there
are no other clauses with the heading “CLAWBACK CONDITION”. Second,
a similar clause in the Initial Facility Letter referred correctly
to Clauses 16(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I
adopt the principle set out in Kim Lewison, <em>The
Interpretation of Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed,
2011) ("<em>Lewison</em>") at para 9.01,
p 465:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As part of the process of construction
the court has power to correct obvious mistakes in the written expression
of the intention of the parties. Once corrected, the contract is
interpreted in its corrected form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The
learned author goes on to cite a few cases supporting the proposition,
two of which I find useful in the present case. In <em>East
v Pantiles (Plant Hire) Ltd</em> [1982] E.G.L.R 111, a case
which the parties also cited in their submissions,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Brightman LJ held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two conditions must be satisfied: first
there must be a clear mistake on the face of the instrument; secondly
it must be clear what correction ought to be made in order to cure
the mistake. If those conditions are satisfied, then the correction
is made as a matter of construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In <em>G &amp; s Brough Ltd v Salvage Wharf Ltd</em> [2009]
EWCA Civ 21, Jackson LJ stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a written agreement as drafted is
a nonsense and it is clear what the parties were trying to say the
court will, as a matter of construction, give effect to the obvious
intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Clause
16(c) was deliberately inserted in the contract for one clear reason.
This is to allow the bank to convert, at its discretion, the relevant amount
into any currency <em>if</em> the borrower
does not provide additional deposits or securities. If Clause 16(c)
refers to Clause 13(a) and Clause 13(b), which speak of a copy of
the insurance and a receipt for full payment respectively, it would
be, in the words of Jackson LJ, nonsense. Clause 16(a) and Clause
16(b) are clearly the clauses that ANZ intended to refer to in the 14 July
letter and ANZ’s error, which it has admitted was a careless one,
is an obvious typographical error. The obvious mistake can be easily
and fairly rectified and I do not think that Edwards can honestly
claim to have been misled or prejudiced in any way by the error
in the clause numbers. In the same vein, Edwards was also not misled
by the wrong house number in Clause 12(ii) where 61 George Street
was, again carelessly, stated as 64 George Street. Accordingly,
I treat the references to Clauses 13(a) and (b) as references to
16(a) and 16(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Even if Clause 16(c) referred
to Clause 16(a) and Clause 16(b), the 14 July letter failed to identify
a “relevant amount” in Clause 16(a) for the purposes of Clause 16(c)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Edwards
argues that Clause 16(a) does not provide for any “relevant amount”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> He says that Clause 16(a) is simply
a definition clause and provides for a mechanism for a notional
determination of the loan to security ratio.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     ANZ
argues that the “relevant amount” is the outstanding amount(s) that
is not in the currency of the Property / Fund (“Property” and “Fund”
as defined in Clause 12 of the 14 July letter) which is the subject
of the notional conversion done in Clause 16(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In
my view, Edwards is correct in characterising Clause 16(a) as a definition
clause. However, it is also clear from the opening words of Clause 16(a)
(<em>viz</em>, “For the purposes of this
clause...”) that the definition of LVR set out in 16(a) applies
to the entire of Clause 16. To understand the meaning of “relevant
amount”, one has to look at Clause 16 in its entirety. It is from examining
Clause 16 as a whole that I take the view that “relevant amount” refers
to the outstanding loan amount denominated in currencies other than
the currency the securities are denominated in. I agree with Edwards that
based on a <em>purely literal</em> reading
of Clause 16(a), there is no use of the term “relevant amount” or
any figure that would be seen as a “relevant amount”. However, I
do not think that means, in the words of Edwards, that “it is impossible
to say what conversions were envisaged” and that the clause is void
for uncertainty. I refer to the case of <em>Travista
Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others</em> [2008]
2 SLR(R) 474; [2007] SCGA 57, where the Court of Appeal held (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law on documentary construction is
clear. It is an established principle of documentary interpretation
that a clause must not be considered in isolation, but must instead
be considered in the context of the whole document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This
proposition is also addressed in <em>Zurich Insurance</em>,
where it was made clear that when construing contracts, the court
will take a holistic approach (at [131]):</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, the exercise is one based on the whole contract or
an holistic approach. Courts are not excessively focused upon a
particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause. Rather the emphasis
is on the document or utterance as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Applying
this principle, Clause 16(a) should not be considered in isolation
but must be considered in the context of the whole document. In this
case, Clause 16(a) refers to the “outstanding amount”. Just above
that, there is the phrase “... <em>in the event
the outstanding loan amount is denominated in a different currency
to the currency of the Security</em>...”. Seen in totality,
these references to the “outstanding amount” provide the answer to
the question as to what “relevant amount” refers to. This outstanding loan
amount which is denominated in a currency different from the currency
of the Security in Clause 16 was the subject of the conversion ratio in
Clause 16(a) which was referred to in Clause 16(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Accordingly,
I disagree with Edwards’ submissions that the 14 July letter failed
to identify a “relevant amount” for the purposes of Clause 16(c).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A conversion of the loan should
not have been performed, as the “outstanding loan amount” referred
to in Clause 16 was not denominated in a different currency to the
currency of the security</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Edwards
argues that Clause 16 does not envisage situations where loans in
multiple currencies were secured by assets in multiple currencies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, Clause 16 does not apply
to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     He
supports this by stating, first, that the outstanding loan amount here
was not denominated in a currency different from the currency of
the security. Two of the loan tranches (Tranches 2 and 8) were denominated
in AUD. This was the same currency as the mortgaged properties.
The “outstanding loan amount” could not be converted to the currency
of the security, as part of it was <em>already</em> in
that currency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Second,
he states that Clause 16 refers to the “currency of the Security”.
This shows that the clause does not cover a situation where loans in
multiple currencies were secured by securities in multiple currencies.
He points out that the securities in this case included:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     a
term deposit of AUD 44,047.27 and a cash pledge of SGD 42,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     an
investment in a fund known as Series II OM-IP 220 Limited in the
amount of AUD 511,650; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     an
investment in Nomura Protected Global Emerging Market Notes in the
value of around USD 500,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     He
then closes his argument by raising the question: for the purpose of
calculating the LVR, which security currency is to be used?<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     ANZ
has four main counter-arguments. First, ANZ argues that the phrase
“in the event the outstanding loan amount is denominated in a different
currency to the currency of the Security” refers to the situation where
any portion of the outstanding loan is denominated in a currency different
from the currency of the security.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Second,
ANZ points to the purpose of Clause 16. ANZ argues that Clause 16
is there to eliminate ANZ’s foreign exchange risk resulting primarily
from a depreciation of the currency of the security against the different
currency or currencies of the outstanding loan. The risk is present as
long as any part of the loan amount is in a currency that differs
from the currency of the security. Accordingly, the phrase “in the
event the outstanding loan amount is denominated in a different
currency to the currency of the Security” has to include the situation
where any portion of the outstanding loan is in a currency different
from that of the security.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Third,
ANZ addresses the second argument of Edwards that the clause does
not cover a situation where loans in multiple currencies were secured
by securities in multiple currencies (at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above).
ANZ argues that this argument was made without the benefit of careful examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> and follows up by referring to Clause
12 of the 14 July letter (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above).
ANZ argues that under Clause 12, “Security” encompasses the mortgages
over 61 and 75 George Street, the assignment of the properties’
fire insurance policy to ANZ, the charge over the term deposit (AUD
44,047.27) and the charge over AUD 511,650.00 Series 11 OM-IP 220
Limited. ANZ argues that these are all denominated in AUD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> However, Edwards, in his reply submissions,
refers to paragraph 44(d) of Crispe’s AEIC, where it states that
ANZ held a cash pledge of SGD 42,000. Accordingly, the term deposit
of AUD 44,047.27 was not the only term deposit held as security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fourth,
to the question posed by Edwards as to which security currency is
to be used for the purpose of calculating the LVR (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above), ANZ states that the
currency of the security refers to the currency of the Property
(defined in Clause 12 of the 14 July letter to mean 61 and 75 George
Street) <em>and</em> the Fund (as defined
in Clause 12 of the 14 July letter) and the express provisions of
both Clauses 14(a) and 16(a) of the 14 July letter provide guidance
for this. Both the Property and the Fund are denominated in AUD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It
is clear to me that the scenario this case presents is on all fours
with that envisaged in Clause 16. I agree with ANZ’s arguments.
The only hesitation I have with regard to the third argument of
ANZ was Edwards’ counter-argument in his Reply that Crispe had asserted
there were other term deposits that were not denominated in AUD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> Having
referred to the paragraph cited (paragraph 44(d)), I see no such
reference to the cash pledge in SGD. However, Maya Lim’s evidence
was that sometime in October or November 2008, a term deposit of
AUD 44,047.27 (which is unobjectionable, being in AUD) <em>and</em> a cash pledge of SGD 42,000 were pledged
by Edwards as security under the facility arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> Seeking to
clarify this by going through the other pieces of evidence, I find
that Crispe’s evidence (at a different location from where counsel
pointed me to) reiterates that on 30 October 2008, AUD 44,027.27
and SGD 42,000 were both pledged as security for the Facility Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> Does
this now mean that there is no singular currency for the Security
as claimed by ANZ and if so, is the clause operative?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Before
I answer these questions, there appears to be some confusion over
the SGD cash pledge and the AUD 44,047.27. Maya Lim’s evidence was
corrected by Crispe’s evidence. Crispe stated that the term deposit
of AUD 44,047.27 and the cash pledge of SGD 42,000 were, in addition
to another term deposit of AUD 27,861.26, pledged for the purposes
of a <em>separate</em> standalone facility
dated 3 April 2008, under which a loan of USD 400,000 was disbursed
to the Plaintiff. This loan was secured in the 3 April 2008 facility
agreement by Edwards’ investment of USD 500,000 in Global Emerging
Market Notes. The term deposits were pledged on 15 August 2008 as
additional security when the LVR for the USD 400,000 loan was breached
and the SGD 42,000 was used to meet interest payments on that same
loan on 10 October 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> However,
the SGD 42,000 was not used to pay down the interest as the said
Notes were sold on 16 October 2008 and the proceeds from the sale
were sufficient to repay the loan in full. As the term deposits
and the cash pledge were no longer required for the USD 400,000
loan facility, a request was made on 30 October for the release
of both the term deposits. The credit team approved the release
of the AUD 27,861.26 term deposit. The AUD 44,047.27 term deposit <em>and</em> the cash of SGD $42,000 were pledged
as security for the Facility Agreement. The answer to the questions
I posed above is that on an objective interpretation of the clause,
the reference is to a singular currency for the “Security”. It is evident
that the “Security” consists of 61 and 75 George Street, the assignment
of the Fire Insurance Policy to the Bank or its nominees, “Term Deposit”
and “Fund”. All these securities were in the same currency (AUD). In
my opinion, the conversion of the loans was valid. Applying the construction
I have adopted to the facts of the case, it is clear that the only contentious
security is that of the SGD cash pledge. The two other term deposits
were in AUD and could be assimilated into Clause 12(iv) (the “Term
Deposit” clause). In my view, the SGD cash pledge cannot be classified
as a term deposit. Instead, the provision of the said cash pledge falls
under Clause 16(b), which allows ANZ to demand a deposit in a currency
acceptable to the bank and/or demand additional securities should
the LVR exceed 80%. At the time the cash pledge was taken in (<em>viz</em>, 30 October 2008), the LVR for the
purposes of the Facility Agreement was above 80%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Accordingly,
I find that, contrary to Edwards’ arguments, Clause 16 applies to
the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The conversion increased, rather
than eliminated ANZ’s foreign exchange risks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Edwards
argues that ANZ was only entitled to redenominate his loan to “fully
eliminate its foreign exchange risks” (see Clause 16(c) at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>). He argues that ANZ’s conversion
of the loan at the material time would not fully eliminate ANZ’s
foreign exchange risks. Instead, the foreign exchange risks would
have been increased. He posits the following scenario:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     Edwards’
income was in USD/SGD;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     After
conversion of the loan, an appreciation of the AUD would result
in payment by Edwards of substantially larger sums in USD/SGD to
make the requisite payments of principal and interest in AUD;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     This
would increase ANZ’s foreign exchange risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Accordingly,
there was no elimination of foreign exchange risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Second,
Edwards argues that the conversion of Edwards’ loan into the security
currency will fully eliminate ANZ’s foreign exchange risks only
if the security was realised when the LVR is less than 100% as the
sale proceeds would settle the full outstandings. However, ANZ did
not issue a margin call until LVR was 115%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> This was ANZ trying to earn higher interest
and increase the price of the loan in terms of Edwards’ income currency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     ANZ
argues that the meaning of its “foreign exchange risks” is very clear:
it is ANZ’s risk of the value of the security it holds depreciating against
the loan outstanding as a result of currency fluctuations, in particular
due to a depreciation of the security currency against the loan currency
that is different from the security currency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Second,
ANZ argues that Edwards’ submissions on ANZ’s foreign exchange risks
Actually address the risk of Edwards defaulting on the repayments
and that Edwards’ interpretation of the phrase is contrary to the
ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Third,
ANZ attacks Edwards’ arguments by stating that he makes two assumptions.
The two assumptions are that the AUD continually appreciates against
his income currency<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> and
that Edwards’ income is the main form of repayment for the outstanding
loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> On
the former, ANZ submits that had the AUD depreciated (an event ANZ
describes as indeterminable and uncertain), the risk that Edwards
described would be eliminated. On the latter, ANZ submitted that
the main form of repayment was <em>not</em> Edwards’
income but was the security that ANZ held.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I
first address Edwards’ arguments. It appears to me that Edwards mischaracterised
the risk that ANZ was seeking to protect itself against when ANZ
spoke of currency exchange risks. He seemed to allude to a default
risk rather than a currency exchange risk; the risk here was that Edwards
himself would default due to a conversion of the USD loan to AUD
coupled with a rising AUD. Edwards, being paid in USD/SGD, would have
to pay more USD as the AUD under the loan would have appreciated. This,
I agree with ANZ, can be characterised as Edwards’ repayment risk
or Edwards’ (as opposed to ANZ’s) foreign exchange risk. Whether
the risk highlighted by Edwards is called repayment or default,
it is nonetheless <em>not</em> ANZ’s foreign
exchange risk which is protected in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     LVR
(as defined in Clause 16(a)) is set at 80%;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
LVR is breached, ANZ can demand additional deposits or securities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     If
there are no additional deposits or securities provided or it LVR
is more than 90%, then ANZ can, at any time in its absolute discretion,
convert the relevant amount (outstanding loan) that the Bank deems
fit in order to fully eliminate its foreign exchange risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     A
key factor in the bank’s consideration of protecting itself must
be that the value of the loan it extends does not exceed the value
of the securities it holds. Two scenarios illustrate how ANZ’s protection
works. Assuming that the outstanding loan amount is denominated
in a currency (USD) different from the currency of the Security
(AUD):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     Scenario
1: AUD appreciates against USD. After notional conversion, LVR is
lower. There is no imminent threat of LVR breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     Scenario
2: AUD depreciates against USD. After notional conversion, LVR is
higher. The rise in LVR threatens a breach of the LVR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     It
is in Scenario 2 that ANZ will turn to Clauses 16(b) and (c) to protect
itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In
respect of Edwards’ second argument, I dispose of it by reference
to Clause 16(c). Under that clause, ANZ is free not to convert the
loan at any level or to convert when the LVR is higher than 90%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Clause 16(c) is void for uncertainty
because it does not provide a mechanism for the calculation of security
value</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Edwards
argues that Clause 16(c) is void for uncertainty. He argues that
Clause 16(c) does not provide for a mechanism for valuing the security for
the purposes of determining the LVR. He submits that the value of
the security is an absolutely essential element in the LVR formula
and without any provision as to how it is to be calculated, the
whole formula fails.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Edwards
also takes issue with ANZ’s arguments that the LVR referred to in
Clause 14(a) is the same as the ratio in Clause 16. First, he says
that the power to determine the LVR in ANZ’s sole discretion is
expressly limited in Clause 14 to that particular sub-clause (<em>viz</em>, Clause 14(a)).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> He argues too that the right bestowed
upon ANZ under Clause 14(a) (<em>viz</em>,
the right to seek payments to reduce the amount owing when LVR exceeds
80%) allowed for a “rough and ready” approach. This was as compared
to the right that allowed ANZ to redenominate a borrower’s outstanding
loan to a foreign currency which would expose the borrower to interest
rate and foreign exchange risks. He claimed the latter right was
drastic and it could not have been parties’ intentions that the
“rough and ready” approach - applicable in Clause 14(a) - be applicable
in Clause 16.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Lastly,
Edwards argues that whenever the need arose to put in a reference
to discretion, ANZ did so. He points to Clause 14(a) and 16(a) and
states that any provision that ANZ may value the securities in its
sole discretion is glaringly absent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     ANZ
does not deny that Clause 16 does not specifically provide for the
method of assessing the value of the security.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> ANZ’s argument is that Clause 14(a)
provides the method for assessing the value of the security. The
ratio referred to in Clause 14(a) is the same ratio that is referred
to in Clause 16. This ratio is the LVR.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> In
addition, ANZ also refers to Clause 16(f) of the Terms and Conditions
where ANZ may at its sole discretion, require a revaluation of the
mortgaged property if ANZ was of the opinion that the value of the
property had declined from the initial valuation amount.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Clause
16(c) refers to the LVR, as defined specifically in Clause 16(a). The
LVR defined in Clause 16(a) refers specifically to the scenario
set out in Clause 16 (<em>viz</em>, “the
outstanding loan amount is denominated in a different currency to
the currency of the Security”). The LVR set out in Clause 14(a) refers
to a more general scenario which did not involve different currencies. In
that sense, the two LVRs are not the same. However, I do not believe
the fact that both LVRs are not the same makes the contract void
for uncertainty. Accordingly, I agree with ANZ that Clause 16(c)
is not void for uncertainty. It does provide a mechanism for the
calculation of security value; the mechanism being that the bank
would assess the values in its sole discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">ANZ did not rely on any valid
valuation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Edwards’
main argument here is that the valuations ANZ had on file were not
valid at the time of the conversions as their validity period was expressly
limited to three months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> It
is his case that when ANZ conducted its first conversion, the valuations
were more than four months old and when ANZ conducted its second
conversion, the valuations were more than 10 months old. Edwards
states that if a valid valuation was used, his LVR would have been
considerably less than the LVR stated by ANZ. He would then have
been able to make payment of a sufficient sum to reduce the LVR
to acceptable levels, avoiding the conversions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     To
this, ANZ argues that it has the contractual right to assess the
value of the security using its discretion. This is not incompatible
with ANZ using the valuations for 61 and 75 George Street done on
4 July 2008. ANZ also argues that the disclaimer for the valuations
of 4 July 2008 states that the report is “for the use of the party
to whom it is addressed and for no other purpose, and no responsibility
is accepted to any third party for the whole or part of its contents”
and therefore the disclaimer stating that the valuation was valid
for three months applied to ANZ only and did not apply to Edwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In
addition, ANZ states that the values were not very outdated in any case
and also contests Edwards’ assertion that he would have been able
to repay the loan if updated and higher valuations were given to
the securities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I
agree with ANZ’s first proposition, that ANZ has the contractual right
to assess the security using its sole discretion. However, a point
that was not canvassed before me was whether this discretion was
unfettered and, if it was not unfettered, whether it was exercised
incorrectly. To answer the question, I turn to <em>Lewison</em>,
who states the following principle (at 14.11):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a contract confers a discretion on
one party, and the exercise of that discretion may adversely affect
the interests of the other party, it will usually be implicit that
the discretion must be exercised honestly and rationally and for
the purpose for which it was conferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Recently,
the High Court has reviewed the authorities and addressed this question
as well. In <em>MGA International Pte Ltd v Wajilam
Exports (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 319, the Court
stated (at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>-<a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contractual discretion is not usually
as unfettered as Ms Tan would like this court to believe. The authorities
on contractual discretion recognise that there is a corresponding
expectation that the discretion would be exercised fairly and rationally.
Guidance can be drawn from <em>Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald
International</em> [2005] ICR 402 (“<em>Horkulak</em>”),
an employment case, on the court’s approach to contractual discretion
at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... while, in any such situation, the parties
are likely to have conflicting interests and the provisions of the
contract effectively place the resolution of that conflict in the
hands of the party exercising the discretion, it is presumed to
be the reasonable expectation and therefore the common intention
of the parties that there should be a genuine and rational, as opposed
to an empty or irrational, exercise of discretion. Thus the courts
impose an implied term of the nature and to the extent described.</p>

Bank Ltd v Standard Bank Ltd</em> [2008] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 558 (“<em>Socimer</em>”) summarised the position in relation
to exercise of contractual discretion as follows (at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is plain from these authorities that
a decision-maker’s discretion will be limited, as a matter of necessary
implication, by concepts of honesty, good faith, and genuineness,
and the need for the absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness, perversity
and irrationality. The concern is that the discretion should not
be abused. Reasonableness and unreasonableness are also not concepts
deployed in this context, but only in a sense analogous to Wednesbury
unreasonableness, not in the sense in which that expression is used
when speaking of the duty to take reasonable care, or when otherwise
deploying entirely objective criteria: as for instance when there
might be an implication of a term requiring the fixing of a reasonable
price, or a reasonable time. In the latter class of case, the concept
of reasonableness is intended to be entirely mutual and thus guided
by objective criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>JML Direct v Freesat
UK Ltd</em> [2009] EWHC 616, Blackburn J referred to <em>Socimer</em> and <em>Horkulak</em> as
authority for the proposition that discretion conferred on one party
by the other is not wholly unfettered contractual discretion. As
Rix LJ observed in <em>Socimer</em>, the
concern is that the discretion is not abused. Hence, the courts
will impose an implied term that the discretion should be exercised
in good faith and not arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally.
“Irrationally” in this connection, (Blackburn J accepts the explanation
in <em>Socimer</em>) is not an objective
test of reasonableness but is used in an analogous sense to the
Wednesbury unreasonableness (see <em>Socimer</em> at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts will not intervene so long as
the contractual “discretion is exercised honestly and in good faith
for the purposes for which it was conferred, and provided also that
it was a true exercise of discretion in the sense that it was not
capricious or arbitrary or so outrageous in its defiance of reason
that it can be properly categorised as perverse” (see <em>Ludgate Insurance Co Ltd v Citibank</em> [1998]
Lloyd’s Rep IP 221 at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> summarising
the principles drawn from cases like <em>Weinberger
v Inglis</em> [1919] AC 606; <em>Dundee General
Hospitals Board of Management v Walker</em> [1952] 1 All ER 896; <em>Docker v Hymans</em> [1969] 1 Ll R 487; and <em>Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company v Product Star
Shipping Company Limited</em> [1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 397).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    ANZ
therefore does not have untrammelled discretion. Applying that to
the present case, I am of the view that the exercise of discretion
by ANZ in using the previous valuations was not arbitrary or capricious
or perverse. The valuations done by CB Richard Ellis on 4 Jul 2008
were four months and ten months old at the time of the first and
second conversions respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> The
value given for 61 George Street was AUD 2m while that for 75 George
Street was AUD 1.3m. It would not be irrational to rely on them
as the periods that had elapsed between the valuations and the conversions
were not unreasonably long. It is also not uncommon to find differences
in valuations done by different valuers. Edwards’ valuer did a retrospective
valuation of 61 George Street after inspecting it on 29 Sep 2011.
He opined that its value as at 18 Nov 2008 would have been AUD 2.5m.
The estate agent engaged to sell 61 George Street stated that the highest
offer recorded for 61 George Street at an auction on 26 Jan 2008
was AUD 2.4m but the sale did not go through as the vendor insisted
on a sale price of AUD 2.45m. No valuation was done for 75 George
Street as Edwards had sold it in 2010 for AUD 1.1m. He said he was
forced to do so by ANZ. ANZ’s valuer did a retrospective valuation
for both Australian properties. He gave his opinion as to their
values on four dates, namely, 4 Jul 2008, 1 Jan 2009, 1 Jul 2009
and 19 Nov 2009. For 61 George Street, the values given were AUD
2m, 1.9m, 1.9m and 1.8m respectively. For 75 George Street, the
values were AUD 1.3m, 1.2m, 1.2m and 1.1m respectively. The fact
that Edwards’ valuer gave a higher value to one of the Australian
properties does not necessarily mean that ANZ’s earlier valuations
were wrong. The same comment applies to ANZ’s updated valuations
done for the purposes of this trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I
am satisfied that ANZ Acted honestly and in good faith in relying
on the valuations done by CB Richard Ellis on 4 Jul 2008. Although
both these valuation reports stated that “[t]his valuation can be
relied upon for a period of three months from the date of valuation
for first mortgage security purposes only”, that does not mean that
they are of no value whatsoever after three months. It merely means
that no liability attaches to the valuer if ANZ chooses to rely
on the reports after the three-month period. Accordingly, I am of
the view that ANZ Acted within its “sole discretion” in valuing
the Australian properties in the way that it did. The argument by
Edwards that an updated valuation would have shown that the LVR
was lower and that he could have avoided conversion is thus disposed of
as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Subsequent conduct of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Edwards’
main arguments are that any ambiguity in the contract should be
construed against the maker of the contract, that subsequent conduct
is irrelevant and that the subsequent conduct relied on does not support
ANZ’s position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    ANZ’s
arguments are in the alternative. First, ANZ reiterates its argument
that Clauses 14 and 16 of the 14 July letter entitled ANZ to effect the
conversions in the circumstances that it did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In
the alternative, ANZ submits that the conduct of the parties will resolve
any ambiguity in the Clauses in favour of the interpretation offered by
ANZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> ANZ
argues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     that
this Court can look at the subsequent conduct of the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
Edwards was fully aware of how the facility worked and was aware
of ANZ’s entitlement to convert Edwards’ loan outstandings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_c"></a>(c)     that
Edwards was aware that the conversions had been effected;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_d"></a>(d)     that
Edwards was fully aware of the value attributed to the mortgaged
properties in the LVR calculations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_e"></a>(e)     that
this Court should take note of Edwards’ reaction to the conversions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_f"></a>(f)     that
Edwards acknowledged his debt in the 22 and 23 October 2009 letters;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_g"></a>(g)     that
Edwards made various unfulfilled promises to repay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Both
parties cited the pronouncements of the Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich Insurance</em> to bolster their case.
However, the parties agreed that subsequent conduct does not have
to be looked at. Edwards submits that the subsequent conduct does
nothing for ANZ’s case and ANZ argues in the alternative only that
subsequent conduct has to be referred to. As I have found that Clauses
14 and 16 of the 14 July letter entitled ANZ to effect the conversions
in the circumstances that it did, there is no need to address this alternative
argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">ANZ’s default interest rate
is penal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Edwards
argues that the ANZ’s default interest rate is manifestly extravagant
and is not a genuine preestimate of loss, stating that the only additional
loss that could be suffered in such circumstances is the additional
administrative costs involved in recovery. He also argues that there
is no evidence that ANZ incurred AUD cost of funding and it would have
been illogical to do so since Edwards’ loans were not in AUD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    ANZ
states that the interest rates applicable to Edwards pre-default was
1% - 1.25% above Cost of Funds. As such, the increase in interest
in the event of default was only an increase of 2.75% - 3%. ANZ
also argues that it did incur cost of funding. Crispe explained
ANZ’s borrowing as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The
Court of Appeal recently reaffirmed the principles with regard to penalty
clauses in <em>CLAAS Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng
Boon Ching</em> [2010] 2 SLR 386 (at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where parties stipulate in a contract the
sum to be paid in the event of a breach, the contract sum is enforceable
if it is a genuine pre-estimate of loss but not if it constitutes
a penalty. It is for the party being sued on the agreed sum to show
that the term is a penalty. Therefore, the burden is on the Respondent
to prove that the term was a penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As
to what a penalty is, the Court of Appeal in the same case stated
(at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Dunlop Pneumatic
Tyre Company, Limited v New Garage and Motor Company, Limited</em> [1915] AC 79,
Lord Dunedin explained, at 86-87, that the question whether a sum
stipulated was a penalty or liquidated damages was a question of
construction to be decided "upon the terms and inherent circumstances
of each particular contract, judged of as at the time of the making
of the contract, not at the time of the breach". He then laid down
the following guidelines, at 87, to assist in determining if a clause
for payment of a fixed sum was a penalty or a genuine pre-estimate
of loss:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    It
will be held to be a penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant
and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss
that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    It will be held to be a penalty if
the breach consists only in not paying a sum of money, and the sum
stipulated is a sum greater than the sum which ought to have been
paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    There is a presumption (but no more)
that it is penalty when "a single lump sum is made payable by way
of compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several
events, some of which may occasion serious and others but trifling
damage".</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In
my view, the increase in interest rates is neither extravagant nor unconscionable
in amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably
be proved to have followed from the breach. The burden is on Edwards
to show that the increase was so extravagant that it cannot constitute
a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which ANZ would suffer. He
has not discharged this burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Edwards
has no evidence to back up his claim that ANZ did not borrow the
AUD that it converted Edwards’ loans into. He simply states that
it would not have made sense to do so. With that, he wraps up his argument
that ANZ did not incur any cost in funding the AUD conversions.
These bare assertions are insufficient to discharge the burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In
addition, Edwards cites the case of <em>Hong Leong
Finance Ltd v Tan Gin Huay &amp; another</em> (“<em>Hong Leong Finance</em>”) [1999] 1 SLR(R) 755.
He cites paragraphs 26 and 27 which I find to be useful here but
I also add the principles that the Court of Appeal set out in paragraphs
24 and 25:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> More
relevant to this appeal was the decision of Colman J in <em>Lordsvale Finance plc v Bank of Zambia</em> [1996] QB 752
which concerned the question of default interest in a syndicated
loan. In that case, the defendant bank entered into two facility
agreements with two syndicates of banks under which the sums of
US$100m and $130m were made available to the defendant. <b>The agreements provided that in the event of default
the defendant was to pay interest during the period of default at
the aggregate rate of (a) the cost of obtaining dollar deposits
to fund the banks' participation, (b) the margin (which was defined
as 1½ per cent) and (c) an additional, but unexplained, one per
cent.</b> When the facility advances fell due for repayment
the defendant defaulted. The plaintiffs, who were assignees of the
rights of certain members of the syndicates, claimed payment of
the principal sum together with default interest due under the agreements. On
the hearing of an application for summary judgment under O 14 of
the rules of the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs did not proceed with
the claim for summary judgment for interest. It was ordered that
the defendant should have leave to defend upon condition that it
paid £800,000 into court, but that in default of payment the plaintiffs
were to be at liberty to sign judgment for the principal sum claimed
"plus interest (if any) to be assessed". The defendant failed to
comply with the condition for payment and judgment was entered against
it in the agreed terms. The defendant failed to pay the default interest
and the plaintiff commenced a second Action to recover it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> Colman J
comprehensively reviewed not only some authorities of great antiquity
but also American, Canadian and Australian authorities, and <b><em>held, inter alia, that the additional rate of one
per cent could not be said to be </em></b><b>in terrorem</b><b><em> and that it was consistent with an increase in
the consideration for the loan by reason of the increased credit
risk represented by a borrower in default, and that accordingly,
the provision for payment of the default interest was fully enforceable.</em></b> The
learned judge said at 763:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b><em>[T]he borrower in
default is not the same credit risk as the prospective borrower
with whom the loan agreement was first negotiated. Merely for the
pre-existing rate of interest to continue to accrue on the outstanding
amount of the debt would not reflect the fact that the borrower
no longer has a clean record. Given that money is more expensive
for a less good credit risk than for a good credit risk, there would
in principle seem to be no reason to deduce that a small rateable increase
in interest charged prospectively upon default would have the dominant
purpose of deterring default.</em></b> That is not because there
is in any real sense a genuine pre-estimate of loss, but because
there is a good commercial reason for deducing that deterrence of
breach is not the dominant contractual purpose of the term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He later said at 763-764:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There would therefore seem to be no reason
in principle why a contractual provision the effect of which was
to increase the consideration payable under an executory contract
upon the happening of a default should be struck down as a penalty
if the increase could in the circumstances be explained as commercially justifiable,
provided always that its dominant purpose was not to deter the other
party from breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Reverting to the case before him the learned
judge concluded, at 767:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b><em>If the increased
rate of interest applies only from the date of default or thereafter
there is no justification for striking down as a penalty a term providing
for a modest increase in the rate. I say nothing about exceptionally
large increases. In such cases it may be possible to deduce that
the dominant function is in terrorem the borrower. But nobody could
seriously suggest that a 1 per cent increase could be such. It is
in my judgment consistent only with an increase in the consideration
for the loan by reason of the increased credit risk represented
by a borrower in default.</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>
<b><em>On the authorities which we have considered, a provision
in a contract stipulating an increased rate of interest applicable
from the date of default is, depending on the circumstances, enforceable
and will not be struck down as a penalty, provided that the increase
(or difference) is not "extravagant and unconscionable in amount
in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved
to have followed from the breach" (</em></b>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> In
the present case, cl 18 of the standard terms and conditions and
cl 10 of the terms of the mortgage provided for payment of default
interest at the rate of 18% per annum for late or non-payment of
moneys due under the mortgage. As laid down in <em>Dunlop
Pneumatic Tyre</em> [1915] AC 79 at 86 and <em>Esanda
Finance</em> (1989) 63 ALJ 238 (<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 242, these provisions should
be construed from the point of view of the parties at the time of entering
into the transaction, and the character of these provisions as penal or
compensatory is to be perceived as a matter of degree depending
on all the circumstances, including the nature of the subject matter
of the agreement. Looking at these provisions objectively and "judged
of" as at the time of the execution of the mortgage, it seems to
us that the default rate at 18% per annum was eminently an extravagant
increase from the rate of 5.5% for the first two years of the term
loan and 6.75% thereafter and was not referable to the true amount
of the loss suffered by the appellants following the breach by the
respondents. The effect of these provisions is that the first respondent would
have to cough up $1,750 per month (or $56.81 a day), which far exceeded
the original monthly instalments of $939.65 (at 5.5%) or $1,017.65 (at 6.75%).
In our opinion, this rate was fixed <em>in terrorem</em> of
the respondents and was intended to deter a breach of the agreement.
In our judgment, the default interest at the rate of 18% per annum
was manifestly extravagant and was out of all proportion in comparison
with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have
followed from the breach by the respondents and was therefore a
penalty and was unenforceable, As such, the default interest claimed
by the appellants is irrecoverable. The appellants' argument that
the default rate was unexceptional in the market and that other
finance houses also charged default interest at rates of 18% or
more per annum was really besides the point. If default interest
at 18% per annum was a penalty, as we held it was, the fact that
it was an industry-wide practice did not make it less so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Applying
the principles set out in <em>Hong Leong Finance</em> leads
me to the conclusion that the default interest rate is not penal.
The calculation of the default interest here is similar to that
in <em>Lordsvale Finance plc v Bank of Zambia</em> [1996] QB 752.
It was (a) the cost of funds or the prime lending rate, (b) the
margin, which was 1%-1.25%, and (c) the additional 3.75%- 4%. The
increase in interest rates here is nowhere close to the increase
in interest rates in <em>Hong Leong Finance</em>.
There, it was 5.5% to 18% or 6.75% to 18%, which is an increase
of 12.5% or 11.25% respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In <em>Soon Kok Tiang and others v DBS Bank Ltd and another
matter</em> [2011] SGCA 55, the Court of Appeal observed (at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of our decision in this appeal,
we think it apposite and timely to remind the general public that
under the law of contract, a person who signs a contract which is
set out in a language he is not familiar with or whose terms he
may not understand is nonetheless bound by the terms of that contract.
Illiteracy, whether linguistic, financial or general, does not enable
a contracting party to avoid a contract whose terms he has expressly
agreed to be bound by. The principle of caveat emptor applies equally
to literates and illiterates in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    If
those who are unschooled in the law or in finance are held to such
a standard, what more a person who is familiar with both? In the
present case, Edwards cannot claim that he is not familiar with
the language of the contract he entered into. He is clearly far
from illiterate. Edwards is a lawyer who works in the finance industry,
who took out a mortgage loan with ANZ on terms he agreed to and
who knew what he was getting into. However, the same terms, which
could have benefited him had the course of the financial markets
taken a different direction, have now saddled him with obligations
which he no longer wishes to or is unable to bear and which he now
wants this court to relieve him of. On the facts here, the court
is not able to grant him the relief he seeks. The contract read
as a whole is not uncertain. Where there were careless errors, they
were clear on the face of the document and could be addressed using
the principles of contractual interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In
the circumstances, Edwards fails in his claim (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above) against ANZ and ANZ’s
counterclaim (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above)
against him succeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Edwards
should pay ANZ the costs of these proceedings on an indemnity basis
in accordance with Clause 15 of the T&amp;Cs. However, ANZ should
bear some responsibility for the many errors in the 14 July letter, some
of which have engendered the contentions made in this trial. I therefore
order that Edwards pay ANZ 90% of the costs of these proceedings
on an indemnity basis.</p>
