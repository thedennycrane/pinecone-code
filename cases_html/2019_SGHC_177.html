While leave is not required, the plaintiff’s right to discontinue his action or withdraw his claim is subject to the inherent powers of the court, and the NOD may be set aside if the purported discontinuance amounts to injustice or an abuse of process: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span><span class="font-italic"> 2017 </span>vol I (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 2017) at para 21/2/3. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">9. In an application to set aside a plaintiff’s NOD, a helpful consideration is whether the court would have granted unconditional leave to serve the NOD had leave been required: <span class="font-italic">Castanho</span><span class="font-italic"> v Brown &amp; Root (UK) Ltd and another </span>[1981] AC 557(“<span class="font-italic">Castanho</span>”) at 572. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 If such unconditional leave would not have been granted, it may be appropriate for the court to exercise its inherent powers to set aside the NOD.

In each instance the court must exercise it judiciously. … this jurisdiction may be invoked when it is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression and to do justice between the parties.

But we do not think that that is the correct approach upon which to invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction.

[1] Typically and most commonly, it is brought in conjunction with an interlocutory application to strike out the writ and as a consequence of the successful striking out, the warrant of arrest would fall away as well … [2] Next, there are instances where the shipowner does not seek to strike out the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ because the claim is brought within the [High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed)]. However, due to non-disclosure of material facts which led to the issuance of the warrant of arrest, the shipowner applies <span class="font-italic">only</span> to set aside the warrant of arrest and seeks damages for wrongful arrest … [3] The third mode which is less common is for the shipowner to provide security and defend the merits of the claim at the trial (as was done in [<span class="font-italic">Fal</span><span class="font-italic"> Energy Company Limited v Owners of the Ship or Vessel “Kiku Pacific” </span>[1998] SGHC 370] and to seek damages for wrongful arrest as a counterclaim following the dismissal of the claim … [4] In fact, [<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he “Trade Resolve” </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 107] suggests that there could perhaps be a fourth way to pursue a claim for damages for wrongful arrest at the interlocutory stage without first applying to strike out the writ or even set aside the warrant of arrest. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The common thread of the four methods, according to the Intervener, is that a claim for wrongful arrest has to be made <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> the context </span>of the arresting party’s <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action.

In <span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu</span>, the assistant registrar (“AR”) had set aside the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ but had declined to set aside the warrant of arrest as the AR found that there was no material non-disclosure by the plaintiff. Accordingly, damages for wrongful arrest were not awarded. The defendant appealed against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the AR’s decision in not awarding damages for wrongful arrest. Before dealing with the merits of the defendant’s claim for damages for wrongful arrest, Chong J found it necessary to examine the issue of “whether damages for wrongful arrest can be awarded if the warrant of arrest was not first set aside” (<span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu </span>at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In seeking to resolve <span class="font-italic">that </span>issue, Chong J considered the methods in which damages for wrongful arrest may be pursued. The methods led Chong J to conclude that “the setting aside of a warrant of arrest is not a prerequisite to pursuing a claim for damages for wrongful arrest” (<span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu </span>at [25]), thereby resolving the issue at hand. Read in that context, it is clear that the four methods were not intended to exhaustively set out the procedural means by which a shipowner may claim damages for wrongful arrest, as that was not an issue before the court in <span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">The Walter D Wallet </span>[1893] P 202 (“<span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet</span>”), the court allowed the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>claim for the wrongful arrest of a ship, and awarded nominal damages to the plaintiff. Significantly, the means adopted by the plaintiff in pursuing its claim was not one of the four methods stipulated in <span class="font-italic">Xin Chang Shu</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as the claim had been brought independently of any <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action by the arresting party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Best Soar Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Praxis Energy Agents Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 3 SLR 423 (“<span class="font-italic">Best Soar</span>”), the owner of a vessel commenced an action in Singapore against the defendant seeking, among others, a declaration that the defendant had wrongfully arrested its vessel in Lebanon and for damages to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Chua Lee Ming J ordered a stay of the action on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. Nonetheless, in arriving at his decision, it was recognised that the owner’s claim for wrongful arrest was a claim in tort: <span class="font-italic">Best Soar </span>at [20]. This is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Congentra</span><span class="font-italic"> AG v Sixteen Thirteen Marine SA (The “Nicholas M”) </span>[2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 479 (“<span class="font-italic">Nicholas M</span>”), where it was recognised at [22] that there exists the tort of wrongful arrest under English law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Collectively, these cases demonstrate that the Intervener may mount a claim under the tort of wrongful arrest <span class="font-italic">independently </span>of the Action, should the Action be discontinued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Test for wrongful arrest outside an </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in rem </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">action is uncertain</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 However, were the Intervener to pursue a claim for wrongful arrest independently of an <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action, the Intervener submits that the appropriate test to be applied is unclear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 If the claim were pursued under the Action, the test would be that as set out in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos </span>(1858) 12 Moo PC 352 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos</span>”), which was held to be of continuing application by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin” </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [134]. The question would simply be whether the Plaintiff’s action “was so unwarrantably brought, or brought with so little colour, or so little foundation, that it rather implies malice on the part of the Plaintiff, or that gross negligence which is equivalent to it”: <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos </span>at 359. In <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Kiku Pacific</span>” [1999] 2 SLR(R) 91 (“<span class="font-italic">Kiku</span><span class="font-italic"> Pacific</span>”) at [30], M Karthigesu JA, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, expressed the test in this way:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]e were of the view that the test to be proved by the owners was not whether there was reasonable or probable cause in bringing the action or in rejecting the security offered in March 1996. Instead the test is that laid down by the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos</span> of <span class="font-italic">mala fides</span> or gross negligence implying malice. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Conversely, if the claim were to be pursued independently of an <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action, the test would arguably be that applied in <span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>That is the only case cited where a shipowner had successfully claimed damages for wrongful arrest <span class="font-italic">independently </span>of an arresting party’s <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action. In <span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet</span>, nominal damages were awarded to the shipowner as the arresting party’s action was held to be “in common law phrase, without reasonable or probable cause; or, in equivalent Admiralty language, the result of <span class="font-italic">crassa</span><span class="font-italic"> negligentia</span>, and in a sufficient sense <span class="font-italic">mala fides</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet </span>at 208).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, the Court of Appeal has questioned the appropriateness of the test adopted in <span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on two occasions, as the common law aspect of the test only requires that the arrest was “without reasonable or probable cause”. This arguably excludes the requirement of malice on the part of the arresting party, which is a requirement under <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos </span>test: see <span class="font-italic">Kiku</span><span class="font-italic"> Pacific</span> at [26] and <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin </span>at [127]. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin </span>at [127]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">importation of the term “reasonable or probable cause” would cause confusion and, more importantly, dilute the threshold required for an action in wrongful arrest to succeed</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> Interestingly, we note that [in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Ohm Mariana” ex “Peony” </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 556 (“<span class="font-italic">The Ohm Mariana ex Peony</span>”)] Selvam JC had imported “without reasonable or probable cause”, one of the required elements of malicious prosecution, into the action for wrongful arrest, but not the other element of malice … He appeared to take the view that the phrase “without reasonable or probable cause” would also encompass <span class="font-italic">crassa</span><span class="font-italic"> negligentia</span> or <span class="font-italic">mala fides</span> in the admiralty context … Nevertheless, Selvam JC had also referred to the Rt Hon T Pemberton Leigh’s famous passage in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evangelismos</span> approvingly (at [44]) and nowhere in his judgment did he hint that the threshold set by the <span class="font-italic">Evangelismos</span> test was too high. The award of damages in <span class="font-italic">The Ohm</span><span class="font-italic"> Mariana ex Peony</span> for wrongful arrest was also based on Selvam JC’s finding that there was malice on the part of the plaintiffs (at [53]). As such, in our opinion, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is doubtful if </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Selvam JC had, in the first place, intended to lay down a less stringent test in The Ohm Mariana ex Peony based on without reasonable or probable cause</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>... That aside, we note that counsel for FESCO, Mr Steven Chong SC, has not attempted to argue before us that the present high threshold set by the <span class="font-italic">Evangelismos</span> test has been problematic for the ship-owning community. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Although it may be argued that the applicable test for pursuing a claim for wrongful arrest if the Action were discontinued and a fresh action initiated is uncertain because of the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Kiku</span><span class="font-italic"> Pacific </span>and <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin</span>, such uncertainty in and of itself is in my view insufficient to set aside the NOD. This is in particular as the passage in <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span><span class="font-italic"> Golovnin </span>above makes clear that the threshold would almost certainly be that of malice, rather than “without reasonable or probable cause”, as suggested in <span class="font-italic">Walter D Wallet</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Deprivation of advantages gained in litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, if the Plaintiff is allowed to discontinue the Action, the Intervener would also be deprived of the advantages which he has gained over the course of the Action, which include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Intervener’s successful application to intervene in the Action,

There, the tenant had issued an originating summons seeking the grant of a new tenancy from the landlord. Subsequently, the tenant applied to withdraw its originating summons. The landlord contested the tenant’s withdrawal, as the landlord contended that the tenant had already entered into a binding tenancy agreement on substantially higher rent than the previous tenancy agreement. The court granted the tenant leave to withdraw the originating summons, on the following terms: (a) the tenant should not make a fresh application for a new tenancy, (b) the grant of leave be without prejudice to the landlord’s contention that a binding agreement had been reached between the parties, and (c) an appropriate order for costs against the tenant. The terms sought in essence to prevent the tenant from rescinding from the position it had taken in discontinuing its originating summons, and to prevent injustice to the landlord.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Hanhyo</span><span class="font-italic"> Sdn Bhd v Marplan Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors </span>[1992] 1 MLJ 51 (“<span class="font-italic">Hanhyo</span>”), the plaintiff commenced a suit against three defendants in respect of the same sum. After the plaintiff obtained a judgment in default of appearance and defence against the second defendant, it filed a notice of discontinuance with respect to its suit against the first defendant. The first defendant objected to the discontinuance as, among others, it had sought an order to stay the proceedings on the ground that the matter ought to be referred to arbitration instead. The court held that the advantage obtained by the first defendant in seeking such an order was certainly insufficient to compel the plaintiff to continue its action against the first defendant, as the plaintiff already had a judgment against the second defendant in respect of the sum claimed for. In the circumstances, the action against the first defendant was discontinued, subject to the following conditions: (a) the plaintiff should not institute a fresh action against the first defendant on the same matter set out in the suit, (b) the grant of leave to discontinue was given without prejudice to the first defendant’s right to institute arbitration proceedings, and (c) other consequential cost orders. Like <span class="font-italic">Covell</span><span class="font-italic"> Matthews</span>, <span class="font-italic">Hanhyo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was a case whereby the plaintiff was entitled to discontinue its action as the loss of advantages on the defendant’s part that flowed from the discontinuance could be counteracted with terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, unlike <span class="font-italic">Covell</span><span class="font-italic"> Matthews </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hanhyo</span>, the advantages which the Intervener has gained in this Action cannot be preserved easily by attaching terms to the discontinuation order. Should the Action be discontinued, the Intervener would first have to obtain recognition of the German insolvency proceedings before he is able to commence fresh proceedings on the Defendant’s behalf. Thereafter, the Intervener would have to issue and serve a fresh writ out of jurisdiction on the Plaintiff, a German entity, in order to pursue his claim for wrongful arrest. The affidavits and Notes of Evidence which he has to rely on would then have to be tendered afresh. In essence, the proceedings would be reset. While the Intervener may be compensated with costs, the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Rohde &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Liesenfeld Pte Ltd v Jorg Geselle and others </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 335 at [14] that “costs are not be (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) the only consideration.

</div>
</div> as the additional costs and delays which flow from the discontinuance of the Action would ultimately be suffered by the Defendant’s innocent creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Considered alongside the uncertainty of the test to be applied when mounting a claim for damages for wrongful arrest outside of <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>proceedings (see [22]–[26] above), it is unlikely that costs would be able to adequately compensate the Intervener for the time and effort that he would expend in re-commencing an action for the wrongful arrest claim. Accordingly, I disallow the discontinuance of the Action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Withdrawal of the claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Nonetheless, there is force in the argument that a plaintiff should not be compelled to “litigate against his will” so long as injustice is not caused to the defendant: <span class="font-italic">Covell</span><span class="font-italic"> Matthews </span>at 879. In this regard, I note that O 21 r 2(1) of the ROC permits a plaintiff to “discontinue the action, or <span class="font-italic">withdraw</span> <span class="font-italic">any particular </span><span class="font-italic">claim</span>” [emphasis added] without the leave of the court, and that such right to discontinue or withdraw is subject to the inherent powers of the court to prevent injustice and an abuse of process (see [8] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, while I disallow a discontinuance of the Action to prevent injustice to the Intervener, I think that it is only fair that the Plaintiff be allowed to withdraw its claim for the Outstanding sum against the Defendant if it so wishes. However, if it does so, the Plaintiff is prohibited from commencing a fresh action for the same claim. This will allow the Plaintiff to discontinue its aspect of the Action, while allowing the Intervener to avoid the uncertainty and loss of advantages that he would suffer were the Action to be discontinued entirely. In my view, this strikes a proper balance between the parties’ respective positions, and ensures that injustice is prevented. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I find support for the propriety of such an order in the case of <span class="font-italic">Setiadi</span><span class="font-italic"> Hendrawan v OCBC Securities Pte Ltd and others </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Setiadi</span>”). There, the plaintiff applied for leave to discontinue its action against OCBC Securities, the first defendant in the case. The judge denied the application to discontinue, and instead struck out the plaintiff’s claim against OCBC Securities, while also precluding the plaintiff from commencing a fresh action against OCBC Securities: see <span class="font-italic">Setiadi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [40]–[43]. This demonstrates that the court may allow the discontinuance of part of the action (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>withdrawal of the claim) in lieu of discontinuing the action as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In conclusion, I find that the present case is an appropriate case which necessitates the court exercising its inherent powers to set aside the NOD, with the result that the Action persists. Atop the setting aside of the NOD, I make the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Plaintiff is at liberty to withdraw its claim in the Action, and, if the Plaintiff decides to do so, I further order that the Plaintiff is not to institute a fresh action with respect to the same claim; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) regardless of whether the Plaintiff withdraws its claim, the Intervener is at liberty to claim and apply for such relief and/or remedy as may be necessary, including but not limited to a claim for damages for wrongful arrest within the Action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For completeness, I must stress that while much was made about the merits of the Intervener’s claim for wrongful arrest, such submissions were irrelevant in the proceedings before me, which relate solely to whether there was an abuse of process or injustice caused to the Intervener by the Plaintiff’s NOD. Also, as I have already set aside the NOD to prevent injustice to the Intervener, I make no findings as to whether the Plaintiff’s filing and service of the NOD amounted to an abuse of process, which is the alternate ground which would necessitate the exercise of the court’s inherent powers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, while the Plaintiff strongly urged the court to consider the case of <span class="font-italic">Newland Enterprise Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">“Santa Arona” (Owners of) </span>[1988] 2 MLJ 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Newland</span>”), I found the case to be of little assistance. In <span class="font-italic">Newland</span>, the defendants did not dispute the fact that the plaintiffs had discontinued the action without leave by serving its NOD. Instead, the dispute involved the effectiveness of orders that had been made after the action had been discontinued. In that regard, the court held that “even after discontinuance by the plaintiff, the court can make such further order as may be requisite for giving effect to rights acquired by the defendant in the course of proceedings”: <span class="font-italic">Newland </span>at 9. The other issue related to whether the defendants’ solicitors had authority to defend the action. Plainly, the matter of whether it was appropriate to set aside the NOD was not raised, and the relevance of the case to the present action is therefore unclear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I will now hear parties on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vincent Hoong  <br/>Judicial Commissioner </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Ming Kwang Kelly and Keng Xin Wee, Shereen (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Yap Yin Soon and Dorcas Seah (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant and intervener. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
