He originally denied the charges and chose to claim trial. On the day of the trial, the accused decided to plead guilty. The accused faces a total of 33 charges. The Prosecution proceeds against the accused on seven charges (“the Charges”) and the remaining 26 charges are taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing after the accused admitted to them (“the TIC Charges”). The accused pleaded guilty to the seven proceeded Charges which involved one daughter (“the victim”). The victim was the youngest of the four daughters whom the accused had sexually abused. The victim was only 12 to 13 years old when the accused sexually assaulted her. She is currently 16 years old.

There are in my view three main categories of factors: the first two broadly relate to the <span class="font-italic">culpability</span> of the offender, and the third to the <span class="font-italic">harm</span> caused to the victim. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 The first category of factors relates to the <span class="font-italic">degree of sexual exploitation</span>. These include the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty (see <span class="font-italic">PP v Heng Swee Weng</span> [2010] 1 SLR 954 (“<span class="font-italic">Heng Swee Weng</span>”) at [22]). The offence is more aggravated if the victim’s private parts are touched, there is skin-to-skin contact (as opposed to touching over the clothes of the victim), and the sexual exploitation continued for a sustained period rather than a fleeting moment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 The court should next consider the <span class="font-italic">circumstances of the offence</span>.

Adopting the principle in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span> ([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [9], the starting point is that caning will be imposed where a victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded upon.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 Finally, the sentence that is ultimately imposed must take into account aggravating and mitigating factors which relate to the offender <span class="font-italic">generally</span>, but which are not offence-specific. Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance (<span class="font-italic">Heng Swee Weng</span> ([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [22(f)]). Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt (which tends to show contrition, which would save the victim the trauma of having to testify in court, and which saves the resources of the state: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [69]), or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused (<span class="font-italic">Heng Swee Weng</span> at [22(g)]). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The court in <span class="font-italic">GBR </span>set out the sentencing bands as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 Band 1 comprises cases at the lowest end of the spectrum of seriousness. These would include those which do not present any (or at most one) of the aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Caning is <span class="font-italic">generally</span> not imposed for this category of cases, although the possibility of caning is not excluded altogether; this depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 Where two or more of the aggravating factors present themselves, the case will almost invariably fall within Band 2. Caning will nearly always be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least three strokes of the cane … At the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim, for example, if the touching occurred over the victim’s clothes. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 At the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases would be those involving the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 The use of deception by the accused is also a relevant aggravating factor which would bring a case to the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 Band 3 cases are those which, by reason of the number of the aggravating factors, present themselves as the most serious instances of aggravated outrage of modesty.

However, they differ on the application of these principles when it comes to the proposed appropriate deterrent sentences for the accused on the proceeded Charges. The differences in the proposed sentences on the proceeded Charges by the parties are discussed below at [93]–[94].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, on the principle of general deterrence, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 37 stated the following at [25(a)]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence.

Not least of these are the fear of confronting the offender, the humiliation and the destabilising emotional conflict and turmoil that keep relentlessly swirling in a victim’s mind. Others, as Judith Lewis Herman in <span class="font-italic">Trauma and Recovery</span> (Basic Books, 1997) points out, simply cope with the trauma by “walling off” the incident and choosing to ignore that it happened, or preferring to view the incident as their fault: see [49] and [50] below. In cases of incest, the victim may face additional pressure from other family members not to expose the rapist out of an instinctive albeit misguided reaction to preserve the unity of the family and to avoid the publicity and shame that inevitably ensues from such a conviction. A victim of incest may <span class="font-italic">herself</span> wish to avoid these consequences and therefore choose not to report the matter. That such pressures are real and palpable are more than amply borne out in many of the cases examined earlier where the perpetrators have repeatedly, remorselessly and brazenly satisfied their perverse and predatory sexual inclinations and lust: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">PP v MU</span> ([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where the perpetrator tragically raped his daughter over a period of ten years.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 That instances of rape should justly cause judicial disquiet is borne out by the fact that while current statistics show that crime has broadly fallen, the number of reported rapes for the months of January to June 2006 has not abated. More significantly, 95% of the reported rape cases involved rapists who were known to their victims. In my view, our courts would be grievously remiss if they did not send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequences</span>. In such cases, the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">sentencing principle of general deterrence must figure prominently</span> and be unmistakably reflected in the sentencing equation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The notorious difficulty of prosecuting intrafamilial sexual abuse is clearly borne out in the prolonged length of time it took for the accused’s sexual assaults to be uncovered. The victim tearfully revealed to her sisters about the accused’s rape on 16 November 2018 when they saw her leaving the accused’s bedroom, followed her to her bedroom and asked her what had happened. This was two years after her father had started raping her. The accused’s bold actions in repeatedly abusing each of his four biological daughters demand that the principle of general deterrence must be the basis of his punishment.

It is patently and wholly unacceptable that the accused sexually assaulted the victim when he had sole care of the victim while V6 left the house at night to work the night shift. The accused exploited and took advantage of these opportunities to sexually assault the victim without detection (see [7] above). This was the accused’s <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>for the 1st, 2nd and 5th Charges. The abuse of trust in this manner is indubitably an aggravating factor.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Premeditation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The evidence is clear that the accused premeditated his sexual assaults on the victim. The accused would take deliberate steps to isolate the victim from the rest of the family before committing the sexual offences. A key example is the incident in the 4th Charge, when the accused brought the victim to the Canberra Flat alone, which was then under construction, in order to isolate her from the rest of the family and raped her (see [12] above). Another example is the incident giving rise to the 1st Charge and the 2nd Charge, where the accused signalled to the victim to enter the master bedroom after she had finished eating her dinner. He also told the victim to return to the bedroom in half an hour with a towel. This was done ostensibly in a bid to give the rest of the family the false impression that the victim was merely taking a shower in the bedroom (see [28] above). The accused’s predatory behaviour in grooming the victim from the time she was in Primary 5 by showing her an explicit video of a girl allegedly having sex with her father (see [6] above) also constitutes evidence of premeditation. The aggravating value of his premeditation is undisputed by both the Prosecution and the Defence.

When the victim was in Primary 5, the accused attempted to normalise the idea of her having sex with him. He did it by showing her a pornographic video of a man and a girl engaging in sexual acts and describing it as a Primary 5 girl having sex with her father (see [6] above). Subsequently, there was a clear escalation in the gravity of the accused’s incursions into the victim’s pure and uncorrupted body. From 2016, the accused advanced to touching the victim’s breasts and buttocks and having sex with her. This further escalated to fellatio and sex from early 2017. In 2018, the accused threatened to stop her from schooling if she did not have sex with him monthly (see [8] above). The accused’s use of sexual grooming and threats to satisfy his sexual perversion are aggravating factors that justify severe punishment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Failure to use a condom</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 This appears to be the only significant point of divergence between the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s sentencing positions.

</div> His first indication to plead guilty was raised three years from the time of his arrest. Does the accused’s plea of guilt arise because he was remorseful and wanted to spare his daughters from the anxiety and agony of revisiting the horrific events? His actions seem to suggest that he pleaded guilty for self-serving reasons, hoping for a lenient sentence. The accused clearly knew that what he did to the victim and his other daughters were serious criminal acts. In the early morning of 17 November 2018, after he had forcefully raped the victim, he realised that the victim and V2 were not in the house. He immediately went to search for them. He suspected that they might have gone to the police station to report the rape. That was why, of all places, he went to three police stations to look for them.

</div> Thus, he was not going to admit to the sexual assaults on his daughters as he wanted to lie and deny the charges. This intention to pervert the course of justice brings me to refer to an incident in 2015 when V2 reported the accused for the sexual assault on her to the police. The accused told V6, his wife, to persuade V2 to lie to the police so that he could be exculpated from the sexual offences. This charge of perverting the course of justice is the 3rd Charge against the accused which is taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He managed to get away with the sexual offences in 2015 and he hoped he could do the same in 2018. The accused was prepared to lie to the police and maintained his innocence until recently when his case was fixed for trial and he realised the avalanche of evidence against him. Thus, he knew that it was hopeless to deny the charges. Hence, his plea of guilt was not because he was contrite or that he wanted to spare his daughters from recalling the dreadful events. The victim, on the other hand, had undergone numerous trial preparation interviews before the accused finally pleaded guilty. She had to recall those unpleasant moments in her life which I am certain she would like to erase from her memory if she could.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Even if there is any residual mitigatory weight of the accused’s plea of guilt, it pales against and is outweighed by the aggravating value of the TIC Charges. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [71], “in cases that were especially grave and heinous, the sentencing considerations of retribution, general deterrence and the protection of the public would inevitably assume great importance, and these cannot be significantly displaced merely because the accused had decided to plead guilty.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Therefore, having regard to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the accused’s plea of guilt, I find that no sentencing discount should be accorded to the accused on account of his plea of guilt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of sentences on the aggravated rape and aggravated SAP offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In summary, I find that the present case falls within the middle to upper end of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks.

This is an intrusive act that caused the victim discomfort and pain (see [18] and [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The circumstances of the offence, namely the presence of premeditation, the abuse of a position of trust, and the use of deception. Premeditation is evident in the manner with which the accused called the victim and her sisters into the master bedroom one by one.

While the High Court did not expressly state the Band in which the case falls within, it can be inferred from the sentence imposed that the court considered the case to fall within the upper end of Band 2 to the lower end of Band 3. In that case, for each fellatio charge, the offender would, after positioning the victim on the bed, remove her clothes and lick her vagina. The victim would resist by bringing her legs together, but the offender would press his hands against her thighs to keep them open. Those incidents usually lasted a few minutes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Weighing all the facts and circumstances relating to the 6th and 7th Charges, I find that the present case falls within the upper end of Band 2 and the lower end of Band 3, with two to three years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane as an indicative starting point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Out of the 26 TIC Charges the accused faces, six are for outraging the modesty of his other daughters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In 2004 when V3 was 6 to 7 years old, the accused circled her vagina with a cotton bud and his finger skin-on-skin (the 16th Charge).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In 2018 when V2 was 15 to 16 years old, the accused touched her vagina skin-on-skin (the 13th Charge).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In 2018 when V2 was 15 to 16 years old, the accused squeezed her breasts (the 14th Charge).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In 2018 when V4 was 14 to 15 years old, the accused touched her vagina skin-on skin (the 23rd Charge).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In 2018 when V4 was 14 to 15 years old, the accused touched her vagina and pinched her breast skin-on-skin (the 24th Charge).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) In 2018 when V4 was 14 to 15 years old, the accused massaged her breasts skin-on-skin (the 25th Charge).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The number of similar TIC Charges reinforces the need for specific deterrence and an upward calibration of the appropriate sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As for the mitigatory weight of the accused’s plea of guilt, my analysis at [112]–[114] above applies here.

The 32nd Charge refers to one incident which stretched over five days. The accused had gotten angry with the victim, V2, V4 and V5 for failing to complete their chores to his satisfaction. As a result, he banned the four children from eating and drinking for five days. As this occurred during the September school holidays, the children had no other means of getting food except for the occasional meal or snack slipped in by their mother (V6), V3 or V3’s boyfriend without the accused’s knowledge. They were eventually allowed to eat plain rice the night before their mother’s birthday.

I find that seven months’ imprisonment for this Charge is an appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The gravity of the offence is aggravated by a number of factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the accused, as the biological father of the victim, has a duty to protect and care for her and her siblings. By completely preventing them from eating and drinking, the accused betrayed this critical position of responsibility, confidence and trust reposed in him as the biological father of the victim, V2, V4 and V5. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">UI</span> at [33], a parent who betrays that relationship and harms his or her child will generally stand at “the <span class="font-italic">furthest</span> end of the spectrum of guilt” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the accused went to great lengths to ensure the victim, V2, V4 and V5 would not have any food or drink, going so far as to bind bottles of water in the refrigerator and dispose of all the food in the house (see [23] above). He also confiscated food which was snuck to the children by the other family members (see [25] above). This pattern of conduct points to a systematic isolation and starvation of the victim, V2, V4 and V5 far exceeding the threshold of mere discipline.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Having regard to the above, I find that the facts of the present case warrant an imprisonment term slightly lower than that in <span class="font-italic">Z</span>.

</div> I am of the view that in addition to the 1st Charge and the 4th Charge, the 32nd Charge should also run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Section 307(1) of the CPC provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">307.—(1)  Subject to subsection (2), if at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which the person is convicted must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The general rule, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Raveen </span>at [54], is that “sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for related offences forming part of a single transaction should run concurrently”. Whether multiple offences form part of a single transaction depends on whether they form a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” (<span class="font-italic">Raveen </span>at [39]), citing D A Thomas, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing: The Sentencing Policy of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division</span> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at p 53). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The sentences for the 32nd Charge and the rest of the proceeded Charges entail the invasion of different legally protected interests. The nub of the former offence lies in the failure of parental responsibilities, while the remaining offences, being sexual in nature, concern the intrusion of the victim’s bodily integrity and virtue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Therefore, I order that the 1st, 4th and 32nd Charges are to run consecutively, with the remaining Charges running concurrently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Imprisonment in lieu of caning</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The parties opine that it is not necessary to impose a further imprisonment term in lieu of the remaining 36 strokes of the cane under s 328(2) of the CPC. I have a contrary view. This is one of the worst cases of rape and SAP. The accused had taken complete advantage of his very young and vulnerable biological daughters to satisfy his sexual perversion over a prolonged period. To the children, the home is the haven where there is parental love, warmth, security, protection, solace, peace, harmony and equanimity. The accused destroyed the cherished values of the victims’ sanctuary and turned their home into a living hell. He had caused unimaginable misery and untold torment to them for several years. In my view, this is an appropriate case to impose imprisonment in lieu of the remaining 36 strokes of the cane. The accused and other similar would-be offenders must not think that they can get away with the statutory maximum of 24 strokes of the cane by committing numerous rapes and SAPs. The deterrent effect of the sentence must not only be reflected in the length of the imprisonment term but also in the punishment of caning. However, the deliberation for the deterrent length of imprisonment and the sentence of imprisonment in lieu of the remaining 36 strokes of the cane must not result in double counting as it would be unfair to the accused. In this case, I am aware that the Prosecution is not seeking a separate term of imprisonment in lieu of the 36 strokes of the cane, as the Prosecution is of the view that 32 years’ imprisonment is sufficient deterrent. Notwithstanding the Prosecution’s submission, I am of the view that the sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning for the remaining 36 strokes of the cane is appropriate for the reasons given above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The imposition of imprisonment in lieu of the remaining 36 strokes of the cane is consistent with the principles and indicative guidelines laid out by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Amin</span>”) at [89]–[91]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 … In our judgment, if the court decides to enhance an offender’s sentence, the extent of such enhancement should bear some correlation to the number of strokes of the cane that the offender has been exempted from. However, we would not go so far as to adopt a pro-rated approach. Rather, we consider that indicative ranges of sentences would better allow sentencing judges to calibrate the extent of the enhancement to fit the circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 We thus provide the following indicative guidelines:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     one to six strokes avoided: up to three months’ imprisonment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     seven to 12 strokes avoided: three to six months’ imprisonment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     13 to 18 strokes avoided: six to nine months’ imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)     more than 19 strokes avoided: nine to 12 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91  Beyond this, in calibrating the precise extent of the enhancement, the court should have regard to the factors we have already discussed at [59]–[86] above. The court should identify the grounds which prompted it to enhance the offender’s sentence in the first place, and consider what length of imprisonment would be appropriate to address those concerns. Additionally, the court should also consider whether any factor which weighed against the enhancement of the offender’s sentence might justify a shorter period of additional imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Following the guidelines in <span class="font-italic">Amin</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the sentence of imprisonment in lieu of the 36 strokes of the cane would have been nine to 12 months’ imprisonment.<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, in view of the circumstances of the case, including the final aggregate sentence imposed and the fact that the accused will have to undergo 24 strokes of the cane, I find that seven months’ imprisonment in lieu of the 36 strokes of the cane is appropriate and proportionate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The first limb of the totality principle requires the court to consider whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [54]). However, totality is not an inflexible rule but a helpful guide (<span class="font-italic">Law Aik Meng</span> at [60]). Thus, sentences far longer than the maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment for rape have been imposed in cases of serious sexual assault where the offences are numerous and serious (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v CBV </span>HC/CC 13/2021 (9 March 2021) where 33 years’ imprisonment was imposed and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BPN </span>HC/CC 93/2017 (26 February 2018) where 34 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane were imposed).

Second, I disagree with the Defence that there should be a downward calibration of the sentence on the basis of the accused’s plea of guilt.

</div> I have already considered the effect of the accused’s plea of guilt on the sentence when calibrating the individual sentences. Further, while I note that there are additional aggravating factors in <span class="font-italic">AOM </span>that are absent in this case, namely, the victim’s contraction of Chlamydia, there are still numerous aggravating factors in the present case. Some of these were echoed in <span class="font-italic">AOM</span>, such as the offender’s unprotected sex with the victim and the use of deception<span class="font-italic">.</span> It is already bad to rape a girl. But to rape three young innocent biological children on multiple occasions over a prolonged period is monstrously heinous beyond any description. Further, he egregiously outraged the modesty of four out of five of his daughters and committed crimes against almost every member of his family. As if all these were not enough, he attempted to pervert the course of justice so that he would not face the music. This is a deserving case for the book to be thrown at the accused. Thus, I do not agree with the Defence that a downward calibration of the aggravated rape offences is warranted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Further, the global sentence of 33 years and two months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane reflects and befits the seriousness of the accused’s crimes. In this regard, the victim impact statements make clear that the accused’s sexual abuse has left them with lasting trauma and painful wounds. As it was the final assault of the victim that led to the police report, the victim expressed how there were times when she blamed herself that her siblings no longer had a father. Despite her family’s support, she could not help but feel that she was fighting this emotional battle alone. She also stated that she would still have nightmares about the incidents at least once a month and has since lost trust in men. V2 stated that she remained silent about the abuse as she was afraid to break up her family, and that keeping silent was very painful for her. V4 fears ever having a father figure in their home again, as it would serve as a reminder of the accused’s deeds.

</div> Though nothing can restore the victims’ innocence or compensate for their suffering, a global sentence of 33 years and two months’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane appropriately reflects the atrocities committed against them and deters would-be offenders from venturing down the same path.
