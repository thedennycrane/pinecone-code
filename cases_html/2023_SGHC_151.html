Gulf International and Gulf Development are collectively the largest power producer in Thailand. Delta is an investment holding company incorporated in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In 2020, Gulf International entered talks with Mr Nguyen Ian Duc Thang and Mr Quintos Roberto Mayo (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Sponsors</span>”) to develop a gas-to-power facility (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Power Plant</span>”) in Bac Lieu Province, Vietnam (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Project</span>”). The Sponsors were shareholder-directors of Delta (they collectively held 75% of the paid-up share capital of Delta at the time). The Project falls under a new governmental program for major infrastructure developments and was (and still is) regarded as a high-profile, nationally important project to Vietnam; it is furthermore part of a pilot for a new model of financing for power projects and being used by the Vietnamese government to develop a policy on project financing in the future. It is said to be critical to Vietnam’s energy security and socio-economic development. The culmination of these discussions were the following agreements: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a Joint Development Agreement between (i) Gulf Development; (ii) Delta; (iii) the Sponsors; and (iv) Unicorn Enterprise Pte Ltd, dated 17 June 2020, and amended on 23 June 2020 and 28 November 2020 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">JDA</span>”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a Convertible Loan Agreement between (i) Gulf International; (ii) Delta; and (iii) the Sponsors, dated 28 November 2020 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">CLA</span>”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a Deed of Security over Shares between (i) Gulf International; and (ii) the Sponsors dated 28 November 2020 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Deed</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Under the JDA, Gulf Development, Delta and the Sponsors agreed that Delta would incorporate a company in Vietnam which would be responsible for developing and implementing the Project. Delta accordingly incorporated Bac Lieu LNG Power Company Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">BLLP</span>”) in Vietnam on 11 June 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Under the CLA, Gulf International agreed to disburse loans to Delta in four tranches upon the achievement of certain milestones of the Project (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Loans</span>”). These were to be applied towards the financing, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the Project. Gulf International disbursed loans in three tranches totalling US$10m – comprising Tranches A, B and C – to Delta (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Disbursed Loans</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Loans were secured by a share charge provided for in the Deed (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Share</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Charge</span>”). Under clause 2.2 of the Deed, the Loans were secured over, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, 75% of the shares in Delta (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Charged Shares</span>”), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the three out of the four issued shares in Delta which were held by the Sponsors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Under clause 4.1 of the CLA, each tranche of the Disbursed Loans was due for repayment 12 months after it was disbursed: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.1 Repayment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to Clause 4.4 (Set-off against Subscription Price), the Borrower shall repay the Outstanding Amount in full within the earlier of:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) five (5) Business Days after the Completion Date; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  the date falling twelve (12) months after the Utilisation Date of the relevant Loan(s) under this Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On Delta’s request, Gulf International extended the repayment dates for two of the three tranches of the Disbursed Loans (a) on 17 November 2021 in respect of Tranche A; and (b) on 3 February 2022 in respect of Tranches A and B (Gulf International denied Delta’s request on 5 April 2022 for a further extension on all three tranches of the Disbursed Loans). Accordingly, the repayment date for the Disbursed Loans was 7 April 2022. However, Delta did not repay any part of the Disbursed Loans by 7 April 2022 or thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 8 April 2022, Gulf International declared an event of default under clause 5.1(b)(i) of the CLA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 13 December 2022, Gulf International filed an application asking that (a) Delta be placed under judicial management; and (b) Mr Patrick Bance (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Bance</span>”) and Mr Jason Aleksander Kardachi (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Kardachi</span>”) of Kroll Pte Ltd be appointed as judicial managers of Delta (case no.: HC/OA 844/2022) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">JM Application</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Three days later, Gulf International filed a summons asking that (a) Delta be placed under interim judicial management; and (b) Mr Bance and Mr  Kardachi be appointed as interim judicial managers of Delta (case no.: HC/SUM 4486/2022) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">IJM Application</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 4 January 2023, Delta applied for all proceedings in relation to the JM Application, including the IJM Application, to be dismissed or stayed pursuant to s 91(7) IRDA, or, alternatively, pursuant to s 6 IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 6 January 2023, Delta amended its application and asked for all proceedings in relation to the JM Application, including the IJM Application, to be stayed only pursuant to s 6 IAA (case no.: HC/SUM 24/2023) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">IAA Stay</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Summons</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Delta then filed a fresh summons for all proceedings in relation to the JM Application, including the IJM Application, to be dismissed or stayed pursuant to s 91(7) IRDA (case no.: HC/SUM 57/2023) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">IRDA</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Summons</span>”). The IAA Stay Summons and the IRDA Summons were made on a common basis, namely, that the debt allegedly owed by Delta to Gulf International was disputed and subject to an arbitration agreement under the CLA, and the court should therefore stay or dismiss the JM Application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 30 January 2023, the AR dismissed the IAA Stay Summons on the basis that there had been a clear and unequivocal admission of the debt by Delta through its multiple requests for extensions of time for the repayment of the Disbursed Loans, and there was therefore no dispute to be submitted to arbitration; accordingly, there was no reason for a stay of proceedings to be granted.

More importantly, the JDA specifically provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the additional terms on which the loans are advanced shall be further agreed between Gulf [Development] and [Delta] and set out in the terms of the loan agreement, including but not limited to: … <span class="font-italic">the loan repayment shall be made after twelve (12) months from the utilization date of each tranche</span>…

</div> It was not in dispute that no such amending document exists. There was therefore no issue of the repayment being “flexible” or “fungible”, as Delta contended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, Delta argued that there was no obligation to repay the Disbursed Loans as it would be set-off against the share premium to be paid by Gulf Development for the acquisition of shares in Delta. This is also misconceived. Clause 4.4 of the CLA provides that Gulf International “may elect to set-off” the outstanding amount of the Disbursed Loans against the sums payable for the subscription of shares in Delta.

The rationale is to prevent an applicant from using liquidation proceedings to bypass the arbitration agreement, which would happen if the court conducted a summary judgment-type analysis on the disputed debt (<span class="font-italic">Salford</span> at [40]; <span class="font-italic">Anan</span> at [30]).

Under s 90(a) IRDA, the court may only make a judicial management order where the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. In cases where that issue turns on a disputed debt, the court would ordinarily, in the exercise of its discretion, require that the debt first be adjudicated – see <span class="font-italic">Hammonds (a firm) v Pro-fit USA Ltd</span> [2007] EWHC 1998 (Ch) at [54] and [55]. Where parties have agreed that arbitration is the mechanism to adjudicate that dispute, they should, in ordinary cases, be held to that bargain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The <span class="font-italic">Salford </span>principle is not engaged where there is no disputed debt or where the debt is admitted (as in this case – see [35] above). The abuse of process exception recognised in <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span> should apply in judicial management applications. Indeed, where it can be established, independent of the subject debt, that a company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, the case for a judicial management application may be more compelling. As will be explained below, that was the situation in this case, where Delta’s own evidence showed that it was insolvent without considering its liability to Gulf International (at [79] and [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Nonetheless, a decision on whether to stay proceedings is ultimately an exercise of the court’s discretion, and there are appreciable differences between winding up and judicial management applications which attenuate the application of the <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> principle in the latter.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The application of the Salford principle to judicial management applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was concerned with the potential for abuse where a creditor could make an “arbitrary or tactical choice” to make a winding up application instead of pursuing an ordinary claim for debt and thereby invite the court to adjudicate a disputed debt notwithstanding that it was subject to arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Anan</span> at [63]). This also applies to judicial management applications. However, with respect to judicial management applications, the <span class="font-italic">potential</span> of abuse is reduced, and the <span class="font-italic">consequences</span> of abuse are markedly different, making this concern less relevant. Significantly, judicial management applications engage concerns of public interest which, in some instances, may justify giving precedence to the insolvency regime over arbitration.  I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 First, the judicial management regime engages a broader public interest than the liquidation regime as the former is designed, as one of its objectives, for the rescue and rehabilitation of an ailing business. As stated by the then Minister for Finance in Parliament during the Second Reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill and introducing the scheme of judicial management, “the benefits of a successful company rescue accrue not only to its shareholders but to employees, the business community and the general public” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 May 1986) vol 48 at col 40 (Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance).

</div>
</div>
</div> The same considerations do not apply to the same degree in liquidations, which engage the more limited concerns of “economic efficiency and optimal returns for creditors” (<span class="font-italic">Anan</span> at [68]). The broader public interest engaged by the judicial management regime arguably should, in appropriate cases, be given greater weight than the principle of party autonomy in the context of enforcing arbitration agreements. The need for swift intervention to rescue and rehabilitate a viable company should be given proper consideration. That factor arises in this very case, given the looming deadline to build the Power Plant and the lack of a coherent or concrete plan from Delta to meet that obligation (see below at [88]). It may be unfair to compel a creditor, which can demonstrate that there are no triable issues with respect to the debt, to go through arbitration to establish that debt only for the debtor company to deteriorate in the meantime to render the same unrecoverable. The case for a stay may be even less compelling where a judicial management order will also benefit other stakeholders, including other creditors, minority shareholders and employees, who may be unable to make or affect decisions to protect or maintain the viability of the business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Court of Appeal appears to recognize this at [69] in <span class="font-italic">Ana</span><span class="font-italic">n </span>(and [45] and [56] in <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil and Gas Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Petroprod Ltd (in official liquidation in the Cayman Islands and in compulsory liquidation in Singapore)</span> [2011] 3 SLR 414)<span class="font-italic">,</span> where it reasoned that a matter “in the wider public interest… [t]herefore… ought to [be] treat[ed]… as non-arbitrable even if the parties expressly included them within the scope of their arbitration agreement”. The Court of Appeal also adopted the same reasoning at [111] and [112] of <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>where it highlighted that the court may grant a stay (instead of dismissing a winding up application) and allow a creditor to restore the application <span class="font-italic">before</span> the debt is established via arbitration, in cases where no triable issues are raised by the debtor company and there are <span class="font-italic">legitimate concerns</span> about the solvency of the debtor company as a going concern. The Court of Appeal gave examples of where the debtor company (a) has no genuine desire to arbitrate the dispute and is simply relying to the arbitration agreement to delay payment of legitimate debts; or (b) is paying off other creditors to stave off other winding up proceedings, to the detriment of the applicant creditor, and there is no legitimate explanation for the different treatment of the creditors. This underscores the point that the court should, in exercising its discretion whether to grant a stay of a judicial management application in favour of arbitration, conduct a holistic examination of the circumstances, beyond potential instances of abuse of process by the debtor company. Those circumstances, in my view, should include a broader consideration of the need to intervene in the interests of the debtor company as well as other stakeholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Second, a judicial management order will only be made where the court is satisfied that one or more of the purposes set out in s 89(1) IRDA would likely be achieved (in addition to a requirement that a debtor company be unable or likely to become unable to pay its debts). This is different from a winding up application, which could turn entirely on whether a company was unable to pay its debt (s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) IRDA), which may be largely or entirely constituted by the disputed debt. This distinction is significant because it reflects the reduced potential for abuse by way of an applicant’s “arbitrary or tactical choice” to make a judicial management application to circumvent the arbitration agreement, since the applicant must additionally show that one of the statutory purposes of judicial management would be achieved to successfully obtain a judicial management order. This is closely related to the point made in the preceding paragraph: the statutory purposes of judicial management reflect the engagement of a broader public interest. It is generally in the public interest to save, not destroy, a company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Third, the <span class="font-italic">consequence</span> of any instance of abuse as contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Salford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Anan</span> is less weighty in judicial management applications as compared to winding up applications. In winding up applications, where the disputed debt is not ultimately established, the court can only order a permanent stay of the winding up order. As noted at [80] of <span class="font-italic">AnAn</span>, a winding up order is draconian and irreversible and, if the <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> principle did not apply, there could be “irreparable harm to the debtor-company’s stakeholders, including shareholders and other creditors”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In contrast, judicial management includes as one of its purposes the survival of the company as a going concern (s 89(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) IRDA), and the court has the power to discharge the company from judicial management when such purpose has been achieved – s 112 IRDA. Further, a judicial management order is effective for only 180 days, unless the court otherwise specifies (s 111(1) IRDA). These mitigate the consequences of abuse. The court should therefore be more ready and willing to invoke the judicial management regime where the purpose is to preserve and protect the interests of its stakeholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Both parties referred me to <span class="font-italic">Fieldfisher</span><span class="font-italic"> LLP v Pennyfeathers Ltd</span> [2016] EWHC 566 (Ch) (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fieldfisher</span><span class="font-italic">”)</span>, where Nugee J dismissed an administration application, which is similar to a judicial management application, applying the <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> principle. Delta pointed out, relying on <span class="font-italic">Fieldfisher</span>, that a court cannot be satisfied if debts are due for the purposes of a judicial management application unless it embarks on an enquiry as to those debts but, where there is an arbitration agreement, this enquiry should not be addressed by the court.

</div>
</div> I agree with the concerns raised by Gulf International. Further, while I accept the policies underpinning the <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> principle, they are, in my view, attenuated in the context of judicial management applications for the reasons set out above. I also note in passing that Nugee J had, ten days after that decision, rescinded his earlier order dismissing the administration application and instead made an administration order, having accepted that the company owed some £270,000 (<span class="font-italic">LF2 Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Supperstone</span> [2019] 1 BCLC 38 at [10]). I therefore do not find <span class="font-italic">Fieldfisher</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> principle should not apply as strictly in judicial management applications. Where an applicant brings a judicial management application based on a disputed debt which is subject to an arbitration agreement, the court should not limit its discretion to stay or dismiss the application only where the alleged debtor is acting in <span class="font-italic">abuse of the court’s process</span>. Instead, the court should make a <span class="font-italic">more holistic assessment</span> of the facts and consider, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the interests of the other stakeholders of the debtor company and the wider public interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Even if Delta’s conduct did not amount to an admission of its liability to repay the Disbursed Loans, I would have dismissed its applications to stay or dismiss the JM Application. This is because (a) there are no triable issues with respect to Delta’s liability to repay the Disbursed Loans; (b) the evidence is clear that Delta is insolvent without considering its liability to Gulf International; (c) Delta is unable to advance the Project; (d) Delta has not acted in good faith in its dealings with Gulf International and in these proceedings; and (e) Delta’s creditors, including Gulf International, and the Project (and its stakeholders) will likely suffer substantial prejudice if there is no timely intervention. I elaborate on these matters below (save for (a), which has been dealt with above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the RA and the IRDA Summons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I thus find that Delta had made clear and unequivocal admissions of the Disbursed Loans owed to Gulf International and that there was therefore no dispute referable to arbitration. I further find that Delta abused the court process. Accordingly, I dismiss the RA and the IRDA Summons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The JM Application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The main issues in the JM Application were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Delta was or was likely to be unable to pay its debts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there was a real prospect that one or more of the purposes of judicial management would be achieved; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the proposed judicial managers were qualified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Gulf International’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Gulf International argued that Delta was or was likely to be unable to pay its debts, and that there was a reasonable probability of rehabilitating Delta or of preserving all or part of its business as a going concern or that otherwise the interest of creditors would be better served than by resorting to a winding up.

</div> These complaints are the subject matter of the arbitration, and I therefore make no comment. However, this argument undermines Delta’s position, as it suggests that Delta cannot continue with the Project without the technical and financial assistance of Gulf Development or another party. In any event, and on any view, there has been a breakdown of trust between Gulf International, Gulf Development, Delta and the Sponsors. In so far as Gulf Development’s expertise would be useful for the completion of the Project, a judicial management order would enable Gulf Development to work with managers it can trust. I note that Gulf Development has committed to working with the judicial managers to advance the Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Delta claimed that the Project’s contractors would not demand or sue for payments currently due on the understanding that the current management continues to manage the Project.
