</strong><em>Cur Adv Vult</em></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The Plaintiffs are a company in the business of

trading and importing goods. At all material times they were the sole distributors in

Singapore for Bionaire air circulators ("Bionaire fans"). An air circulator is a

high velocity fan that is capable of moving a large volume of air. The Bionaire fans are

manufactured by Bionaire International BV, a Dutch company. The Defendants are a company

in the business of marketing and trading.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        Sometime in June 1998 BIBV received an inquiry

from a company in Singapore concerning agency rights for the Bionaire fans. In accordance

with their practice on such matters, BIBV passed it to the Plaintiffs in Singapore for

them to handle. The Plaintiffs’ General Manager, Chong Ann Sin ("Chong"),

contacted Witzan Tirtazana ("Witzan"), the Defendants’ director. Witzan, an

Indonesian businessman, told Chong that he was interested in selling the Bionaire fans in

Singapore and Indonesia. Chong told him that the Plaintiffs were the sole distributors of

the products in Singapore only. Chong and Witzan began negotiations on the terms of a sole

agency agreement ("the Agreement") for the Singapore market.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        As Witzan did not have a corporate vehicle in

Singapore to undertake the business, he invited his friend, Richard Tay Chor Teng

("Tay"), to be his partner in the venture. They agreed to share equally in the

costs and profits. They agreed to use the Defendants, a company owned by Tay, as the

contracting party with the Plaintiffs. The parties eventually agreed upon the terms of the

Agreement and it was signed on 15 July 1998. Two days later, on 17 July 1998 the

Defendants placed on order for 320 units of Bionaire fans and paid a deposit of $15,000 to

the Plaintiffs. The shipment arrived on 21 August 1998 and the Defendants then paid the

balance sum of $16,971.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The Bionaire fans could not be sold immediately

because the Plaintiffs had not managed to obtain approval from the Productivity and

Standards Board ("PSB") for the product to be sold in Singapore, a requirement

under the law for such electrical products. Unfortunately for the parties, the PSB

approval was not forthcoming over the next few months despite frantic efforts on the part

of the Plaintiffs and the increasingly desperate entreaties on the part of the Defendants.

The Plaintiffs had initially thought that PSB approval for the Bionaire fan could easily

be obtained on the strength of a certificate issued by TUV, a European testing body.

However it was only after they had made the application to PSB and after several rounds of

correspondence and clarifications that they discovered that the European TUV certification

was not recognised by PSB. But by then there was already a considerable delay. In the end

the Plaintiffs decided to obtain certification by submitting the Bionaire fan for testing

in Singapore, a process that took several more months. It was not until 31 December 1998

that the PSB approval was finally obtained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        Meanwhile the Defendants were getting desperate

as their investment was literally locked up in the warehouse. They were keen to recoup

their capital in this venture which they thought would have turned a quick profit. Witzan

said that he was incurring interest in excess of 20% on the Indonesian Rupiah at the time.

They began selling the Bionaire fans even before the PSB approval was obtained. This was

the cause of considerable dispute between them and the Plaintiffs and things came to a

head when on 22 October 1998 Tay, on the Defendants’ behalf, wrote a most remarkable

letter to the Plaintiffs’ principal, BIBV.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The letter began by asking whether the

Agreement, a copy of which was attached, was "recognised" by BIBV. It continued

by saying that at the time they were appointed as authorised agent in July, the Defendants

had indicated to the Plaintiffs their interest to expand to the regional markets. Tay then

accused Chong of making "connections" with those territories without the

Defendants’ knowledge. The letter then complained about the manner in which Chong had

handled the affair in the following manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We had placed a container of 320

    units in July 98 … and to-date we have not heard from … Chong regarding [the PSB

    approval]. As you may or may not have known, such approvals are mandatory … and the

    penalty in terms of fine is severe. It has been more than 3 months since July that the

    attached document dated 21 October 1998 was then finally put forth to PSB … for

    application. We must bring to your attention that we have attempted empteen [sic] times to

    send our reminders and even plead with him to expedite the matter, however to our

    astonishment we were ever told to even stop selling the product. No official reply was

    received from him on letters sent … We have always the intention to continue to

    indent more containers as we are very confident of the upmarket product and your esteemed

    Company but this is subjected to [PSB’s] acknowledgement and approval.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On this note, we have to inform

    you that the heavy cost incurred in printing of the product brochures and warrantee cards

    was borne by us and no support was given whatsoever by [the Plaintiffs]. Right now, we are

    stuck with about 200 units of the Bionaire fan in the warehouse which we are unable to

    sell and yet we are accountable for the daily expenses accrued. A few of the big orders

    placed has to be cancelled and those established organisations who have expressed their

    interest, questioned our safety features in which we are not confident to handle and

    ultimately led to the lost of sales.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The sales manager of BIBV, Johannes Van Lent

("Lent") telephoned Chong and told him about Tay’s letter. He faxed a copy

to Chong on 27 October and requested him to deal with the matter. Chong was livid. This is

what he said in his affidavit evidence in chief: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50. I was disgusted and

    embarrassed by what the Defendants had done and told Hans that I would look into the

    matter and ask the Defendants to explain their conduct. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51. The Defendants' Richard Tay

    in his fax dated 22/10/98 to the Principal attached the Agreement dated 15/7/98, that

    Winston and I had signed and had the nerve to ask if the 'contract was recognised' by the

    Principal !! The Defendants in their fax to the Principals were going behind the

    Plaintiffs’ back to question the Plaintiffs' capacity to sign the contract. They

    clearly undermined the Plaintiffs' position and showed a lack of good faith and trust.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52. Richard Tay further accused

    me of making connections with Asian regional markets without the Defendants' knowledge in

    an effort to prevent or hinder the Defendants' business. In the first place the Plaintiffs

    were only appointed by the Principals in the territory of Singapore. The Principal had

    appointed other Companies as their sole distributors in the other regional territories.

    Richard's vague accusation that I made ' connections with ' other territories is also

    false and made purely to discredit the Plaintiffs and me. In any event neither the

    Plaintiffs nor I were restricted in any way by the Agreement from doing business outside

    of Singapore and certainly were not obliged to inform the Defendants of their business

    activities. Richard Tay in making such an allegation was suggesting that the Plaintiffs or

    I were unethical or dishonest in doing business.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53. Richard Tay then went on to

    try and impress the Principal with his knowledge of the product and enclosed the letters

    dated 14/9/98 and 23/9/98 he had sent to the Plaintiffs regarding the products.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        Chong said he telephoned Witzan and told him

that such behaviour was completely unacceptable, i.e. writing behind the Plaintiffs' back

and making untrue allegations about the Plaintiffs. He asked for a written explanation for

their conduct to be sent to the Plaintiffs immediately. Chong said that he called Witzan

again on 29 October and reminded him about the written explanation. Witzan does not deny

that Chong called him about this. He said he asked Chong to take up the matter with Tay.

However Tay seemed to have forgotten about this completely. This was the exchange in his

cross-examination:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: After this letter was sent, did you receive

    any phone call from Chong?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: No.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: Did you receive a call from Witzan telling you

    that Chong had called him over this letter?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: Cannot remember.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: Did Witzan tell you that Chong wanted a

    written explanation for the letter?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: Cannot remember.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: Witzan said that Chong called him after this

    letter and that he asked you to handle the matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: Cannot remember.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q: Did Witzan ask you why you had sent this

    letter to BIBV?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A: No. We had no discussion on that. He left the

    day-to-day running to me.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The last answer seems to suggest

a rather laid-back attitude by Witzan over this matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        By 11 November 1998, having received no

response from Witzan or Tay, Chong sent a letter to terminate the contract, invoking

clause 12 of the Agreement which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[The Plaintiffs] reserve the

    right to terminate the appointment of [the Defendants] if [the Defendants’]

    performance in productivity or conduct is deemed to be unsatisfactory by [the Plaintiffs].</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Chong said that both sides had

clearly understood that it was essential to the Agreement that the Plaintiffs have a high

level of trust and confidence in the Defendants. By writing the letter of 22 October to

BIBV, the Defendants had acted in bad faith and destroyed the whole basis of the

Agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        The Defendants' case is that Chong had promised

them at the outset that the PSB approval would be obtained by the time the first shipment

arrived. They claimed that they had emphasised to Chong during the negotiations that it

was essential to have the PSB approval in order to sell the Bionaire fans and that Chong

had assured them that the approval would be obtained by the time the goods arrived. When

it was not, and the delay lengthened, they grew increasingly desperate. When Chong seemed

to make no headway with the PSB approval they felt that it was reasonable to go directly

to BIBV. They alleged that Chong’s termination was made in bad faith, done in order

to cover up the fact that he had promised timely delivery of the PSB approval and his

inadequate handling of the matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        The Defendants’ case hinges on their

allegation that Chong had promised them, or represented, that the PSB approval would be

obtained by the time the first shipment arrived. It is a reasonable story as there is no

doubt that Chong was confident about the PSB approval at the time because he was rather

surprised to learn later that the TUV Europe certificate was not acceptable to PSB.

However if this promise was of such importance to the Defendants, they certainly did not

reveal it in any of the contemporary documents. They did not mention it in any of the

letters that they had sent to the Plaintiffs leading up to the termination. Indeed, they

did not even mention this to BIBV in their 22 October letter. While they complained about

Chong’s incompetence in obtaining the approval, they chose to conceal Chong’s

promise to them upon which they had placed such great reliance at the outset.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Indeed, even when the Plaintiffs’ former

solicitors wrote to the Defendants on 17 March 1999 to demand for the return of the

Bionaire fans, they did not complain about Chong’s broken promise to obtain PSB

approval by the first shipment. It was not until this action was commenced that this

allegation surfaced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        As far as the witnesses are concerned I find

Chong to be a reliable witness in the box whose answers in cross-examination were

forthright, reasonable and logical, and consistent with the documents. On the part of the

Defendants, Witzan’s evidence is not altogether consistent with the surrounding

facts, although he tried to give reasonable answers. He claimed to have left matters to

Tay; yet when the first shipment arrived, it was he who was notified in Indonesia. Tay on

the other hand did not hesitate to give answers that were completely contradicted by the

contemporary documents. For example he said that Chong had given them the green light to

sell the Bionaire fans notwithstanding that the PSB approval had not been given. Yet in

his own letter to BIBV, the one dated 22 October, he said that Chong had told them to stop

selling the fans. He had said that he knew it was an offence to sell the fans without the

PSB approval and had emphasised this to Chong in order to pressure the latter to procure

the approval as soon as possible. Yet he was later to sell more than half the fans before

PSB approval was obtained. I have no hesitation in concluding that Tay’s evidence is

wholly unreliable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        I find as a fact that Chong had not made the

alleged promise, and that at worst he might have exuded confidence at the time about the

PSB approval. The nature of the Defendants’ letter to BIBV is clear. They were not

really interested in merely being the sole agent in Singapore – they were hoping for

bigger things. The tone of the letter clearly suggests that they were taking the

opportunity to undermine the Plaintiffs vis--vis BIBV in the hope that the latter would

give them the distributorship instead. This was what Chong was upset about and this was

the basis upon which he had terminated the Agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Accordingly, I find that Chong had terminated

the Agreement <i>bona fide</i> and his reason for doing so are within the contemplation of

clause 12. In the premises the Plaintiffs are entitled, by an implied term of the

Agreement, to the return at cost of the unsold goods remaining in the possession of the

Defendants. The latter had refused to return those goods and had in fact sold them off for

a profit. Accordingly the Defendants are in breach of this implied term of the Agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        Further, clause 11 of the Agreement provides

that the Defendants shall not engaged in any business in competition with the Plaintiffs

during the term of the Agreement and for a period of twelve months thereafter. By selling

the Bionaire fans in competition with the Plaintiffs, they have breached this clause.

Indeed the Defendants were putting the fans in the market at a much lower price than that

being charged by the Plaintiffs’ dealers.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        

Accordingly, I order the Defendants to:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) render an account of the profits made by them

    in the sale of the fans after the Agreement was terminated on 11 November 1998 and to pay

    the Plaintiffs such profits, with interest at the statutory rate from the date of this

    judgment;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) pay damages for breach of the non-competition

    clause in the Agreement in the sum of a token $1 in view of the fact that the Plaintiffs

    have not offered any evidence of the damage suffered by them;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) pay the Plaintiffs’ costs at the

    standard rate.</font></p>
