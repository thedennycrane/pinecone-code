        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against a decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Phua
                        </em><em>Kiah Mai and another v Foo Jong Peng and
                        others</em> [2012] SGHC 14 (“the Judgment”) granting
                    declarations, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Management
                    Committee (“Management Committee”) of the Singapore Hainan Hwee
                    Kuan (“the Association”) did not have the power to remove office
                    bearers from their positions on the Executive Committee (“Executive
                    Committee”). We dismissed the appeal and now set out the detailed grounds
                    of our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       All the parties to this appeal are members of
                    the Management Committee of the Association. The Association was registered with
                    the Registry of Societies on 18 December 1890. For purposes of clarity, the
                    parties will be addressed by name and the positions held by the parties will be
                    described as they were prior to the disputed Management Committee meeting held
                    on 20 October 2011 (hereafter referred to as “the 20 October
                    2011 Meeting”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The First Respondent, Phua Kiah Mai, is the
                    President of the Association and the Second Respondent, Hun Chin Guan, is the
                    Honorary Secretary General.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The First Appellant, Foo Jong Peng, was
                    President for two consecutive terms from January 2006 to January 2010 and is
                    presently the First Vice President. The Second Appellant, Lee Teck Hai, is the
                    Head of the Public Relations Division and had proposed the motions for the
                    removal of Phua Kiah Mai and Foo Jong Peng from their positions. The Third
                    Appellant, Han Tan Juan, is Head of the Cultural &amp; Education
                    Division and had proposed the motion for the removal of Hun Chin Guan from his
                    position. The Fourth Appellant, Foo Shick Thai, and Fifth Appellant, Pang Fui
                    Nam, were elected as the new President and Honorary Secretary General
                    respectively after resolutions to remove Phua Kiah Mai and Hun Chin Guan were
                    passed at the 20 October 2011 Meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Management structure of the Association</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Under Rule 8 of the Rules of the Singapore
                    Hainan Hwee Kuan (“the Rules”), Management Committee members will
                    be elected by a vote of the general body of members at the Annual General
                    Meeting (“AGM”). Rule 7 provides that the elected Management
                    Committee members shall hold office for a term of two years. The Management
                    Committee administers the affairs of the Association, and has the duties and
                    powers to implement resolutions passed by the General Meeting, formulate the
                    overall policy for the Association and control the budget and
                finances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The elected Management Committee members then
                    elect from amongst themselves the office bearers (“office
                    bearers”) of the Association – the President, three Vice-Presidents
                    and the heads and deputy heads of ten committees each dealing with a specific
                    aspect of the Association’s affairs – under Rule 9. The
                    functions and duties of each office bearer are defined in the Rules. Pursuant to
                    Rule 13, all the elected office bearers will then collectively form a
                    smaller Executive Committee. Pursuant to Rule 16, the Executive Committee has
                    the powers to, <em>inter alia</em>, implement resolutions
                    passed by the Management Committee and to oversee the general administration of
                    the Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties were all voted in as members of the
                    Management Committee by the general body of members at the AGM held in January
                    2010. The parties – save for Hun Chin Guan, who was only elected after the
                    previous Honorary Secretary General resigned in May 2011 – were then
                    elected to their respective positions by the members of the Management
                    Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Kheng Chiu Tin Hou Kong and Burial Ground
                    (“Tin Hou Kong”) is a company incorporated in Singapore and
                    limited by guarantee. It effectively operates as the financial arm of the
                    Association and provides the funds needed to support the Association’s
                    activities. Foo Jong Peng is the Chairman of Tin Hou Kong’s board of
                    directors and Phua Kiah Mai is the Vice-Chairman. All the parties to this appeal
                    except Hun Chin Guan also sit on the board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sometime in March 2011, a dispute arose between
                    Foo Jong Peng and Phua Kiah Mai over the management of the financial affairs of
                    Tin Hou Kong. During a meeting of the Tin Hou Kong board of directors on
                    26 July 2011, Foo Jong Peng expressed the view that he was no longer able
                    to work with Phua Kiah Mai and proposed to table a motion to remove Phua Kiah
                    Mai as Vice-Chairman. The other directors objected to this motion as proper
                    notice had not been given. At a subsequent meeting of the Management Committee
                    of the Association held on the same day, Foo Jong Peng again attempted to table
                    a motion to remove Phua Kiah Mai as President of the Association. Phua Kiah Mai
                    – who was chairing the meeting – rejected the motion as it was not
                    in accordance with the agenda. Foo Jong Peng proposed that a special Management
                    Committee meeting be called to remove Phua Kiah Mai as President of the
                    Association and Hun Chin Guan then requested Foo Jong Peng to provide a reason
                    for removal and to send in an official proposal to table the
                motion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 3 August 2011, Foo Jong Peng wrote to
                    Hun Chin Guan in the latter’s capacity as the Honorary Secretary General,
                    calling for a special meeting of the Management Committee on 16 August 2011
                    with the proposed agenda of “re-organising” the Management
                        Committee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The letter was signed by 26 members
                    of the Management Committee. An intervening Management Committee meeting was
                    held on 5 August 2011, but the meeting was inquorate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Phua Kiah Mai then sought the advice of his
                    solicitors M/s RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP
                    (“RHTLaw”). RHTLaw replied to Foo Jong Peng, stating that the
                    Honorary Secretary General was not in a position to convene a special Management
                    Committee meeting for the sole purpose of removing the President as the
                    Management Committee had no power to remove an office bearer under the Rules.
                    Foo Jong Peng nonetheless proceeded to convene a meeting of the Management
                    Committee on 16 August 2011, purportedly upon the request of 25 other
                    Management Committee members. Phua Kiah Mai and Hun Chin Guan did not attend the
                    meeting, and no resolutions were passed in their absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 12 September 2011, Lee Teck Hai wrote
                    to Hun Chin Guan, proposing a motion to remove Phua Kiah Mai as the President of
                    the Management Committee and to elect a new President, to be voted upon at the
                    next Management Committee meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    Lee Teck Hai sent a second letter on 15 September 2011 to table a further
                    motion to remove Foo Jong Peng as the First Vice President of the Association
                    and for the election of a new First Vice President.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Hun Chin Guan replied on 19 September 2011, reiterating the alleged legal
                    position that the Management Committee had no power to remove the President and
                    First Vice President in the absence of express provisions in the Rules and that
                    any resolution passed to this effect would be <em>ultra
                        vires</em> and void; it would thus be meaningless for the two proposed
                    motions to be placed on the agenda.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Following an adjournment of a Management
                    Committee meeting on 28 September 2011 due to a lack of quorum, Lee Teck
                    Hai sent a letter on 7 October 2011 advising Hun Chin Guan that a meeting
                    of the Management Committee should be convened on an urgent basis for the
                    purpose of adopting and approving the accounts for the Financial Year 2010, and
                    that the continued failure to do so would put the Management Committee in breach
                    of the Association’s Rules and statutory requirements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was followed by a
                    letter from Tan Han Juan to Hun Chin Guan on 10 October 2011, proposing a
                    third motion to remove Hun Chin Guan as the Honorary Secretary General and for
                    an election to fill the vacancy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Hun Chin Guan did not respond to Lee Teck Hai
                    or Tan Han Juan. Lee Teck Hai then requested Foo Jong Peng to convene a
                    Management Committee meeting. On 12 October 2011, Foo Jong Peng issued a
                    notice – in his capacity as First Vice President – convening the
                    20 October 2011 Meeting. The notice stated that the meeting had been
                    convened upon the request of over half of the Management Committee members, and
                    the listed agenda included the approval of the Association’s accounts for
                    the Financial Year 2010 and the motions to remove Phua Kiah Mai, Foo Jong Peng
                    and Hun Chin Guan from their respective positions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    Notice of the meeting was duly served on all members of the Management
                    Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 17 October 2011, RHTLaw wrote to Foo
                    Jong Peng, stating that the notice to convene the meeting was improper. The
                    proposed meeting was nevertheless held on 20 October 2011 and was attended
                    by a sufficient quorum of 27 Management Committee members. Phua Kiah Mai
                    and Hun Chin Guan were both absent from the meeting. The members approved the
                    Association’s accounts for the Financial Year 2010 and resolutions were
                    passed removing Phua Kiah Mai and Hun Chin Guan from their positions. The motion
                    to remove Foo Jong Peng as First Vice President was defeated, and Foo Shick Thai
                    and Pang Fui Nam were elected as the new President and Honorary Secretary
                    General, respectively, following a vote by the members present at the
                    meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Phua Kiah Mai and Hun Chin Guan then filed
                    Originating Summons No 975 of 2011 (“the Originating
                    Summons”) in the High Court.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge held that the Rules did not
                    expressly provide for the removal of a member of the Executive Committee,
                        <em>ie</em>, an office bearer, and declined to imply a
                    term permitting the Management Committee to remove members of the committee (it
                    was ambiguous which committee the Judge was referring to) apart from general
                    expulsion from the Association for misconduct (see [5] of the
                Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As the Management Committee members were
                    appointed for a fixed two-year term, the Judge considered that a more reasonable
                    interpretation of the Rules was that the members of the Association did not
                    intend to have the membership of the committee rotated before the term had
                    expired (<em>ibid</em>). The smooth functioning of the
                    Association might otherwise be impeded by “constant election
                    battles” (<em>ibid</em>). If the Rules provided for
                    the members to hold office for two years, they were entitled to do so and the
                    court would not imply a term for their removal (<em>ibid</em>). In the absence of an express provision in the Rules, the
                    Management Committee could not remove Management Committee members before the
                    expiry of their terms (<em>ibid</em> at [6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     No order of court was extracted prior to the
                    filing of this appeal and it was not apparent from the Judgment whether the
                    Judge had granted all nine prayers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellants appealed against the entirety
                    of the Judgment, raising two main issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was an implied term in
                        the Rules giving the Management Committee the power to remove an office
                        bearer in the Executive Committee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the 20 October 2011 Meeting was properly
                        convened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first issue was the key point of contention
                    between the parties. However, before turning to analyse the two main issues, we
                    will first address a preliminary issue that was raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary issue: whether live issue to be decided</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the day of the oral hearing, a preliminary
                    point was raised that we should decline to hear this appeal on the merits as
                    there was no longer a live issue to be decided. The Respondents relied on this
                    court’s decision in <em>Attorney-General v Joo Yee
                        Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 165
                        (“<em>Joo Yee</em>”) for the proposition
                    that the Court of Appeal should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to decline to
                    decide an issue which the Appellants retain no interest in, even if the decision
                    would set a useful precedent for future cases. Counsel for the Respondents
                    informed us that a new Management Committee had been elected at the AGM held on
                    20 May 2012 and that new office bearers had also been elected by the
                    Management Committee; accordingly, even if the Appellants were to succeed in the
                    present appeal, it would not affect their interests as the Respondents’
                    terms of office had lapsed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We did not agree with the Respondents that the
                    instant appeal was one where there was no live issue to be decided and
                    considered that the principles laid down in <em>Joo
                        Yee</em> were not directly applicable to the facts of this case.
                        <em>Joo Yee</em> involved very unusual factual
                    circumstances where the appellant, the Attorney-General (representing the
                    Ministry of Health (“MOH”)), had taken a neutral position before
                    the High Court, <em>viz</em>, it did not object to any of
                    the legal positions contended for as long as a direction of court was made. The
                    respondent company, Joo Yee Construction Pte Ltd (“Joo Yee
                    Construction”), had entered into a construction contract with the MOH
                    with provisions governing the employment of nominated subcontractors and when
                    direct payments could be made to these subcontractors. When Joo Yee Construction
                    subsequently went into liquidation, a question arose as to whether direct
                    payments made by the MOH to four nominated subcontractors would contravene the
                    combined operation of ss 280(1) and 327(2) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 1988 Ed). The High Court ruled that the payments were in
                    contravention of the Companies Act and were accordingly void as against Joo Yee
                    Construction’s liquidators. The Attorney-General then appealed; the four
                    nominated subcontractors either did not appeal or withdrew their appeals.
                    Notably, as parties had agreed amongst themselves on costs, costs were not in
                    issue (see <em>Joo Yee</em> at [6]). This court followed
                    the principles in the House of Lords decisions of <em>Sun Life
                        Assurance Co of Canada v Jervi</em>s [1944] AC 111 (“<em>Sun Life Assurance</em>”) and <em>Ainsbury v Millington</em> [1987] 1 WLR 379 (“<em>Ainsbury</em>”) and held as follows at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In so far as the Ministry of Health was concerned, its interest in
                        this issue ceased to exist once the court had ruled on the issue <em>and</em> the four nominated subcontractors had accepted
                        the court’s ruling by withdrawing or not proceeding with their
                        appeals. <b><em>The Ministry of Health could not thereafter be
                            prejudiced or be exposed to the risk of litigation at either the
                            instance of the respondents or the four nominated subcontractors if it
                            acted in accordance with the ruling of the court</em></b><em>.</em> Accordingly in our view there was no live issue in
                        this appeal. [emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We now turn to briefly consider the decisions
                    in <em>Sun Life Assurance</em> and <em>Ainsbury</em>. In <em>Sun Life Assurance</em>,
                    the English Court of Appeal affirmed an order of the court below granting
                    rectification of an endowment policy of life assurance and the consequent
                    payment of additional sums due to the assured as a result of the rectification.
                    Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was granted on the following specific
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the [Appellants’] undertaking to pay the costs as between
                        solicitor and client in the House of Lords in any event and not to ask for
                        the return of any money ordered to be paid by this order...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Viscount Simon LC, delivering the judgment for the House of
                    Lords, declined to hear the appeal and set out the relevant principles, as
                    follows (at 113–114):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>The difficulty is that the terms put on the
                            appellants by the Court of Appeal are such as to make it a matter of
                            complete indifference to the respondent whether the appellants win or
                            lose. The respondent will be in exactly in the same position in either
                            case. He has nothing to fight for, because he has already got everything
                            that he can possibly get, however the appeal turns out, and cannot be
                            deprived of it.</em> … [t]he objection here is that, if the
                        appeal fails, the respondent gains nothing at all from his success.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I think it is an essential quality of an appeal fit to be
                        disposed of by this House that there should exist between the parties a
                        matter in actual controversy which the House undertakes to decide as a
                        living issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The House of Lords followed <em>Sun Life
                        Assurance</em> in <em>Ainsbury</em>. An appeal
                    was filed against the refusal to grant an injunction ordering the respondent to
                    vacate a council house. By the time the appeal was before the House of Lords,
                    the local authority had terminated the tenancy of the council house, and both
                    the appellant and respondent were no longer in possession. Both parties were
                    legally aided throughout the proceedings with nil contributions. The House of
                    Lords held that “neither party can have any interest at all in the
                    outcome of the appeal” and dismissed the appeal. Lord Bridge made
                    the following important observation (at 381C-D):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>Again litigation may sometimes be properly
                            continued for the sole purpose of resolving an issue as to costs when
                            all other matters in dispute have been resolved.</em>
                        Realistically counsel did not suggest that the possibility in this case of
                        either party being ordered to pay the costs of the other, which in practice
                        is so remote as to be negligible, could be regarded as affording a
                        sufficient lis inter partes to keep the appeal alive. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The common thread running through all three
                    cases considered above was this: costs were not in issue because the parties to
                    the appeal had reached some form of agreement on costs. It was an integral part
                    of the reasoning in all three cases that any ruling made on the dispute would
                    have no effect on the parties’ rights and obligations not only because the
                    subject matter of the appeal was moot or would have no direct legal consequences
                    for the parties if resolved either way, <em>but also</em>
                    because <em>none of the parties had a monetary interest in the
                        outcome</em> as all questions of costs had been disposed with. The
                    present case was thus distinguishable from the cases considered above. While it
                    was true that the election of new office bearers of the Executive Committee
                    meant that the Respondents’ previous terms of office had lapsed and the
                    issue of whether the Respondents still legally held their offices despite the
                    purported removal was therefore rendered moot, the parties to this appeal were,
                    quite unfortunately, unable to come to an agreement on costs. If the Appellants
                    were successful, the Respondents would have been liable for costs here and
                    below, and the positions of the parties may therefore have been affected. We
                    agreed with Lord Bridge’s observations cited above at [24] (see
                        <em>Ainsbury</em> at 381C-D) and considered that the
                    potential costs ramifications in the present appeal meant that the Appellants
                    retained a real interest in the outcome of this dispute before us; see also
                    Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in the House of Lords decision of <em>R (Bushell and others) v Newcastle upon Tyne Licensing Justices and
                        another</em> [2006] 1 WLR 496 at [5]–[6] (<em>cf</em> Lord Brown at [23] expressing some doubt on
                    whether costs alone could provide a sufficient <em>lis</em>
                    for an appeal, although this observation was made in the context of the special
                    character of the House of Lords as a second-tier appeal court and the
                    requirement of leave to appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We thus rejected the Respondents’
                    preliminary objection and proceeded to hear the substantive merits of the
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The implied power of the Management Committee to remove an office
                bearer </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Law relating to terms implied “in fact”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The law relating to implied terms in fact was,
                    until fairly recently, thought to be well-established, albeit not entirely
                    certain in its precise ambit of application. A summary of the two traditional
                    tests, <em>viz</em>, the “business efficacy”
                    test and the “officious bystander” test, is found in the Singapore
                    High Court’s decision of <em>Forefront Medical Technology

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    It has always been
                            acknowledged that particular terms might be implied into particular
                            contracts. However, in order not to undermine the concept of freedom of
                            contract itself, terms would be implied only rarely – in
                            exceptional cases where, as one famous case put it, it was <em>necessary</em> to give “<em>business efficacy</em>” to the contract (see <em>per</em> Bowen LJ (as [he] then was) in the
                            English Court of Appeal decision [of] <em>The
                                Moorcock</em> (1889) 14 PD 64). In the words of
                            Bowen LJ himself (at 68):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called, a covenant in law, as
                            distinguished from an express contract or express warranty, really is in
                            all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon
                            reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously
                            have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of
                            giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of
                            consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either
                            side; and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and there are
                            many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that
                            in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed
                            intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction
                            such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it
                            should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires
                            to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the
                            transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who
                            are [businessmen]; not to impose on one side all the perils of the
                            transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure,
                            but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must
                            have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be
                            responsible for in respect of those perils or chances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    Indeed,
                            Lord Esher MR adopted a similar approach, although it is
                            Bowen LJ’s judgment that is most often cited. This is
                            probably due to the fact that a close perusal of
                            Lord Esher MR’s judgment will reveal that the learned
                            Master of the Rolls did not <em>explicitly</em>
                            adopt the “business efficacy” test as such. It might be
                            usefully observed at this juncture that the third judge, Fry LJ,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    There was another test,

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then
                            said: “Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be
                            implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes
                            without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their
                            bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision
                            for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common
                            ‘Oh, of course!’”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">At least it is true, I think, that, if a term were never implied by a
                            judge unless it could pass that test, he could not be held to be
                            wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Interestingly, the essay referred to above was in fact a public lecture

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The relationship between the two tests is
                    complementary, rather than alternative or cumulative: the officious bystander
                    test is the <em>practical </em><em>mode</em> by which the business efficacy test is implemented (see

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Belize test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The conceptual basis of the implication of
                    terms was reconsidered in the Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Court
                    of Appeal of Belize) of <em>Attorney General of Belize and others
                        v Belize Telecom Ltd and another</em> [2009] 1 WLR 1988
                        (“<em>Belize</em>”). Lord Hoffmann,
                    delivering the advice of the Board, stated that “[t]he proposition that
                    the implication of a term is an <em>exercise in the construction
                        of the instrument as a whole</em> is... a matter of logic”
                    [emphasis added] (at [19]) and reformulated the test for implied terms
                    (hereafter referred to as “the <em>Belize</em>
                    test”) in the following terms (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that in every case in which it is said that some provision
                        ought to be implied in an instrument, <em>the question for
                            the court is whether such a provision would spell out in express words
                            what the instrument, read against the relevant background, would
                            reasonably be understood to mean.</em> It will be noticed from
                        Lord Pearson’s speech [in <em>Trollope &amp; Colls
                            Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</em> [1973]
                        1 WLR 601 at 609] that this question can be reformulated in various
                        ways which a court may find helpful in providing an answer—the implied
                        term must “go without saying”, it must be “necessary to
                        give business efficacy to the contract” and so on—but these are
                        not in the Board’s opinion to be treated as different or additional
                        tests. <em>There is only one question: is that what the
                            instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would
                            reasonably be understood to mean?</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The two traditional tests, in the learned law lord’s view,
                    merely represented different ways in which the courts have expressed this key
                    question, and Lord Hoffmann warned of the “dangers in treating these
                    alternative formulations of the question as if they had a life of their
                    own” (at [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Belize test considered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There has, in fact, been a dearth of local
                    authority considering the <em>Belize</em> test. Whilst the
                    recent Singapore High Court decision of <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v
                        PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another</em> [2012] 3 SLR 801 referred
                    to the <em>Belize</em> test, we refrain from commenting on
                    it as we understand that appeals are pending before this court. There was also
                    an observation, by way of <em>obiter dicta</em>, by this
                    court in <em>MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd and another v
                        Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd and another appeal</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 150 (“<em>MFM</em>”), where
                    it was stated as follows (at [98]; see also at [100], where there is a further
                    reference in the context of terms “implied in law”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is interesting to note, at this juncture, that the broad underlying
                        thread of <em>interpretation</em> which
                        Lord Hoffmann utilises in advocating his approach centring on
                        assumption of responsibility by the defendant (a point perceptively made by
                            <em>Wee</em> [Paul C K Wee,
                        “Contractual interpretation and remoteness” [2010] LMCLQ 150]
                            <em>...</em> has <em>also</em>
                        been utilised by the learned law lord in the area of implied terms as well
                        (in particular, to terms implied <em>in fact</em>)
                        – hence, the analogy drawn by Lord Hoffmann between both these
                        aforementioned areas. However, and with the greatest of respect, the
                        uncertainty generated in the latter area would, in our view, apply equally
                        to the former area. In the recent Privy Council decision (on appeal from the
                        Court of Appeal of Belize) of <em>Attorney General of Belize
                            v Belize Telecom Limited</em> [2009] 1 WLR 1988, for example,
                        Lord Hoffmann, delivering the judgment of the Board, adopted an
                        extremely broad approach towards the implication of terms in fact,
                        effectively <em>effacing</em> the distinction between
                        the time-honoured “business efficacy” and “officious
                        bystander” tests (for a general account of these two tests (as well
                        as their possible relationship), see the Singapore High Court decision of
                            <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak
                            Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at [29]–[40]). This
                        results, however, in a lack of concrete rules (and consequent normative
                        guidance) as well as uncertainty in the practical sphere (a point which is
                        also emphasised by <em>Wee</em> at 162–166;
                        reference may also be made to Elizabeth Macdonald, “Casting Aside
                        ‘Officious Bystanders’ and ‘Business
                        Efficacy’?” (2009) 26 JCL 97). One should not, in fact, be
                        surprised at such a result as the lack of guidance as well as uncertainty is
                        likely to be the result when the <em>umbrella</em>
                        concept of <em>interpretation</em>, which is pitched at
                        a <em>necessarily high level of abstraction</em>, is
                        utilised (in substance, if not form) as the legal basis for <em>different and disparate areas of law</em> (<em>cf</em> also the collected essays in Brian Coote,
                            <em>Contract as Assumption - Essays on a Theme</em>
                        (Hart Publishing, 2010) (Rick Bigwood ed); in so far as <em>The Achilleas</em> itself is concerned, see the very recent
                        comment by Brian Coote, “Contract as Assumption and Remoteness of
                        Damage” (2010) 26 JCL 211 (“<em>Coote</em>”)). The lack of guidance stems from the absence
                        of a sufficiently specific set of <em>concrete</em>
                        rules and principles whilst the resultant uncertainty is the natural
                        consequence when legal rules and principles lacking specific and concrete
                        guidance are sought to be applied to the various sets of facts (which are
                        themselves necessarily myriad in nature) (in this regard, see also generally
                        this court's observations in <em>Mühlbauer AG v Manufacturing
                            Integration Technology Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 724
                            (“<em>Mühlbauer</em>”) (at
                        [40]–[43]) about the danger of over-generalisation and
                        over-abstraction in making legal arguments). Put simply, whilst it is
                        desirable from a conceptual perspective to have umbrella doctrines that make
                        for <em>theoretical</em> “neatness”,
                        there is a limit to which one can have “one-size-fits-all”
                        <em>doctrines</em> that will not ultimately become
                        legal procrustean beds (see also <em>Wee</em> at 166
                        and 175–176). Indeed, the necessity for <em>specific</em> rules and principles has always been the hallmark
                        of the development of the common law. Such specificity has, in fact, been
                        (perhaps paradoxically) one of the key strengths of the common law itself,
                        which is why Prof S F C Milsom perceptively observed
                        that the common law system developed in a strikingly systematic fashion,
                        notwithstanding the apparent absence of a clear blueprint as such (see
                        generally S F C Milsom, “Reason in the Development of
                        the Common Law” (1965) 81 LQR 496; see also <em>Mühlbauer</em> (at [42]) where it is observed that there is an
                            <em>interactive</em> process between the <em>universal</em> and the <em>particular</em> or the <em>general</em> and
                        the <em>specific</em> in law and decision-making).
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As we shall see, the observations in <em>MFM</em>, although rendered by way of <em>obiter dicta</em>, are significant inasmuch as they embody what is,
                    with respect, the fundamental difficulty with the <em>Belize</em> test. And it is that whilst the process of implication
                    (of terms) is, when viewed in a more general sense, also a process of
                    interpretation, the process of implication itself is, in the final analysis,
                    just one specific conception of the broader concept of
                    “interpretation”. In particular, the process of implication is
                        <em>separate and distinct from</em> the more general
                    process relating to the interpretation of documents. Indeed, the process of
                    implication of terms proceeds, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, on
                    the <em>absence</em> of an <em>express</em> term of the contract. Hence, the implication of a term,
                    whether in fact or in law (for the distinction between these two categories of
                    implied terms, see generally <em>Forefront</em> (at
                    [41]-[44]); reference may also be made to the decision of this court in
                        <em>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 at [90]-[91]), involves tests as well as techniques
                    that are not only specific but also different from those which operate in
                    relation to the interpretation of documents in general and the (<em>express</em>) terms contained therein in particular (see also
                    the observation of Lord Steyn in the House of Lords decision of <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman</em> [2002]
                    1 AC 408 at 458 as well as the perceptive observations by Prof Gerard
                    McMeel in <em>The Construction of Contracts –
                        Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification</em> (2nd ed,
                    Oxford University Press, 2011) at para 10.04). The (general) <em>concept</em> of “<em>interpretation</em>” has much in common with the <em>implication</em> of terms <em>inasmuch as both
                        entail an objective approach</em>. <em>However</em>, it is, in our view, incorrect to <em>conflate</em> the tests as well as techniques which accompany both
                    the aforementioned processes. Before proceeding to elaborate further, it would
                    be appropriate at this juncture – consistently with the views just
                    expressed – to note the very pertinent observations by a learned author,
                    as follows (see Paul S Davies, “Recent developments in the law
                    of implied terms” [2010] LMCLQ 140 (“<em>Davies</em>”) at p 144):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Hoffmann’s speech in <em>Belize</em>
                        may be seen to assimilate further implication within interpretation. Indeed,
                        this was Lord Hoffmann’s stated aim, since “the
                        implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. It only spells
                        out what the instrument means”. Yet this is questionable as a matter
                        of logic: if the contract is silent on a point, by implying a term the court
                        is supplementing, or replacing, this silence. It is submitted that it is
                        stretching the boundaries of interpretation too far to suggest that
                        implication is not an addition to the instrument, or that it simply gives
                        effect to what the instrument means. An implied term may give effect to what
                        the instrument should, ideally, have expressly provided for, but not what
                        the instrument means in the form in which it was agreed by the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no utility in artificially forcing the doctrine of implication
                        within the confines of interpretation. Indeed, it may actually be dangerous.
                        This is exemplified by the fact that it no longer matters if the parties
                        would not have responded to the officious bystander with a cursory,
                        “Oh, of course!” Why should a term be imposed upon a party if
                        it would not have instantly agreed to such a term upon being asked by a
                        bystander? ... <em>Belize</em> suggests that the
                        subjective intentions of the parties are now irrelevant, and that the only
                        matter of importance is what the reasonable observer would understand the
                        contract to mean.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Returning to <em>Belize</em>, as is evident from Lord Hoffmann’s approach
                    in that case (quoted above at [29]), the central focus or test is premised on
                    – to use more general terminology – the concept of <em>the reasonable person</em>. As a learned author put it,
                    “the approach to be derived from <em>Belize</em>
                    seems to entail, in the context of contractual implied terms, the replacement of
                    the officious bystander by another character from legal folklore, formerly
                    referred to as the man on the Clapham omnibus” (see John McCaughran,
                    “Implied Terms: The Journey of the Man on the Clapham Omnibus”

                    p 614). It is important to note that this particular concept of the
                    reasonable person is to be viewed as a <em>single (and, hence,
                        objective) standard </em><em>inasmuch as it is the
                        court which stands in the shoes of “the reasonable
                        person”</em> in determining what the contractual instrument,
                    read as a whole against the relevant background, would <em>reasonably be understood</em> to mean. Indeed, despite his more
                    general misgivings on the concept of the reasonable person when it is in effect
                    used in a subjective manner, the invocation of this particular (objective)
                    concept of the reasonable person in the context of implied terms is one which
                    appears to have been mooted by the learned law lord at least as far back as 1995
                    in the 24<sup>th</sup> Lord Upjohn Lecture which was
                    delivered on 12 May 1995 at the Inns of Court School of Law (see
                    Lord Hoffmann, “Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His
                    Friends” (1995) 29 The Law Teacher 127 (“<em>Anthropomorphic Justice</em>”) (especially at
                    pp 138–140); see also, by the same author, “The Intolerable
                    Wrestle with Words and Meanings” (1997) 114 South African LJ 656 at
                    p 662 and, more recently, “A conversation with
                    Lord Hoffmann” [2010] Law and Financial Markets Review 242 at
                    p 243). Significantly, though, the following (and oft-cited) observations
                    by Lord Radcliffe in the House of Lords decision of <em>Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</em> [1956] AC
                    696 (at 728), which were relied upon by Lord Hoffmann in <em>Anthropomorphic Justice</em> in support of the “reasonable
                    man” approach in the context of the implication of terms, were made in
                    the context of the doctrine of <em>frustration</em> (a
                    point which the learned law lord himself noted (see <em>Anthropomorphic Justice</em> at pp 127-128) and which, very
                    importantly in our view, is a doctrine that applies by operation of <em>law</em> and therefore does <em>not</em>
                    concern the search for the presumed intention of the contracting parties (which
                    is the case where the <em>implication</em> of terms is
                    concerned)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far
                        disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in
                        peace. In their place there rises the figure of the fair and reasonable man.
                        And the spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all
                        no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the
                        court itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As already alluded to above, inasmuch as the
                    concept of the reasonable person implies <em>an objective
                        approach</em>, that concept must surely be an integral part of the
                    process of the implication of terms. However, the adoption of an objective
                    approach does not, in and of itself, tell us <em>how</em> a
                    particular term ought – or ought not – to be implied (<em>ex hypothesi</em>, on an <em>objective</em> basis). Put simply, <em>a particular
                        test (or tests) of implication are imperative</em>. In so far as
                    “terms implied <em>in fact</em>” are
                    concerned, these would, in our view, take the form of the “business
                    efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests. These tests
                    constitute (in the manner set out above at [28]) specific as well as concrete
                    guidance for the courts in a situation where the contracting parties have not,
                        <em>ex hypothesi</em>, made express provision for the
                    situation concerned in the first place by providing default background
                    guidelines on when the parties may be presumed to have – or not have
                    – a particular unexpressed intention. More importantly, underlying
                        <em>both</em> the “business efficacy” and
                    the “officious bystander” tests is a criterion that is <em>not necessarily</em> present when applying the broader
                    concept of interpretation, <em>viz</em> (with no pun
                    intended), that of <em>necessity</em>. In this regard, the
                    following observations by Lord Clarke MR in the English Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Mediterranean Salvage and Towage Ltd v
                        Seamar Trading and Commerce Inc, The Reborn</em> [2010] 1 All ER
                    (Comm) 1 (“<em>Mediterranean Salvage and
                    Towage</em>”) (at [15]) are particularly significant (reference may
                    also be made to the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Eastleigh B </em><em>C v Town Quay Developments
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 2 P &amp; CR 2 at [32] (<em>per</em> Arden LJ) as well as
                    Lord Grabiner QC, “The Iterative Process of Contractual
                    Interpretation” (2012) 28 LQR 41 at pp 58–61):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s I read Lord Hoffmann’s analysis [in <em>Belize</em>], although he is emphasising that the process of
                        implication is part of the process of construction of the contract, he is
                        not in any way resiling from the often stated proposition that it must be
                        necessary to imply the proposed term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the threshold of <em>necessity</em> is of little guidance in isolation, and the
                    “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests
                    give practical meaning to this criterion. In contrast, a direct practical
                    relationship with the presumed intentions of the contracting parties is absent
                    from the threshold of “reasonable meaning” as a standalone
                    concept.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On a related (and no less important) note, the
                    search under the rubric of implied terms is a search for <em>the
                        presumed intention of the contracting parties</em>. In other words,
                        <em>the court ought not to – and, indeed, cannot
                        – simply substitute its view as to that intention</em>. Put
                    simply, the intention may be presumed, but the court cannot be presumptuous. We
                    accept that a sceptic might well argue that such a search by the court is a
                    fiction. However, even if we accept that argument, not all <em>legal</em> fictions are necessarily fictitious in the pejorative
                    sense that the turn of phrase is utilised by a layperson. Indeed, we would go
                    further: We are of the view that there is no legal fiction involved inasmuch as
                    the court concerned does indeed sift through the objective evidence before it in
                    order to ascertain what the presumed intention of the contracting parties is. In
                    doing this, the court is constantly cognisant of the cardinal (and guiding)
                    principle that it will <em>not</em> re-write the contract
                    for the contracting parties. It is true that the very nature of an <em>implied</em> term necessitates some investigation of sorts on
                    the part of the court. <em>However, it bears reiterating that the
                        court does not substitute its own view of what the contracting parties
                        should have intended had the gap in their contract been brought to their
                        attention at the time they entered into the
                contract.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, there are legal boundaries or
                    parameters which the court will not transgress. One of these is an obvious one:
                    Where there is already an <em>express</em> term covering
                    the situation at hand, the court will <em>not
                        </em><em>imply</em> a term which <em>contradicts</em> that particular <em>express</em> term (see, for example, Pearlie
                    Koh &amp; Andrew Phang Boon Leong, “Express and Implied
                    Terms” in ch 6 of <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy
                    Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em>”) at para 06.054). Another relates to a
                    principle already emphasised above, <em>viz</em>, the
                    criterion of <em>necessity</em>. The very nature of this
                    criterion means that the court will imply terms “in fact”
                    <em>sparingly</em>. In order to arrive at its decision
                    whether or not to imply a term “in fact”, it will utilise the two
                    tests mentioned above (<em>viz</em>, the “business
                    efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests) which, by their
                    very nature, are directly related to ascertaining how <em>the
                        contracting parties</em> would (or would not) have filled the gap
                    which ought not to have existed had it been covered by an <em>express</em> term in the first place. Again, one must, in our view,
                    resist the approach of the sceptic merely because <em>the
                        court</em> is involved in this exercise. To put it bluntly, this
                        <em>is</em> the court’s task, <em>regardless</em> of the views of the sceptic. More importantly, the
                    court strives, from its <em>external</em> vantage point, to
                    ascertain (through the <em>objective evidence</em>
                    available) the <em>internal</em> intention of the
                    contracting parties <em>had they been apprised of the situation
                        concerned</em>. This is why the search is for the <em>presumed</em> – as opposed to the actual and subjective –
                    intention of the contracting parties. The concern of the sceptic is, with
                    respect, a misplaced one. No one would seriously controvert the sceptic’s
                    concerns if all that he or she is saying is that the process is an imperfect
                    one. After all, it <em>was</em> indeed the imperfection of
                    the contracting parties in <em>leaving a gap</em> in their
                    contract in the first place that created the <em>necessity</em> for implying the term. Utilising the criterion of
                    necessity as embodied within the two tests referred to above, the court attempts
                    its level best to ascertain the presumed intention of the contracting parties in
                    order to ascertain whether or not it will imply the term concerned. Indeed, on a
                    more general level, the law of contract is <em>not</em>
                    – owing to a variety of both theoretical as well as practical reasons
                    – concerned with the <em>actual subjective</em>
                    intentions of contracting parties <em>per se</em> but,
                    rather, is (as already alluded to above) concerned with ascertaining such
                    intentions <em>via </em><em>objective
                        evidence</em> (and on the concept of objectivity, see generally the
                    analysis (as well as the literature cited therein) in Andrew Phang Boon
                    Leong &amp; Goh Yihan, “Offer and Acceptance” in
                    ch 3 of <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> at
                    paras 03.006-03.020). What is clear, however, is that adopting the approach
                    of the sceptic is to regress down a slippery slope into legal oblivion and
                    disempowerment. In this regard, it would not, perhaps, be inappropriate to refer
                    to some observations from a lecture delivered at the University of Hong Kong in
                    2009 which were also referred to in <em>MFM</em> (at [138])
                    (see Andrew Phang, “Doctrine and Fairness in the Law of Contract”
                    in <em>The Common Law Lecture Series 2008-2009</em>
                    (Jessica Young &amp; Rebecca Lee gen eds) (The University of Hong
                    Kong, 2010) pp 17-100 at pp 18-24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Put simply, the central thesis of the present lecture is this: The rules
                        and principles which constitute the <em>doctrine</em>
                        of the law are not ends in themselves but are, rather, the means through
                        which the courts arrive at <em>substantively fair</em>
                        outcomes in the cases before them in <em>every</em>
                        area of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[It should be added] that neither is more important than the other. In
                        other words, the desire to arrive at a fair outcome does not mean that the
                        courts can manipulate legal doctrine in an arbitrary fashion. Indeed, part
                        of [the] task in the present lecture is to demonstrate -
                        through illustrations from the law of contract - that
                        legal doctrine is a coherent body of rules and principles which contain many
                        common threads or linkages. Hence, any attempt to manipulate them in order
                        to arrive at a predetermined result would be both artificial as well as
                        unacceptable, and would instead lead to a loss of legitimacy in the law in
                        the eyes of both the legal profession as well as the public alike. [It
                        should also be mentioned], at this juncture, that academic literature is
                        also important in the analysis as well as formulation of legal doctrine,
                        especially with regard to the consideration of nascent and/or controversial
                        areas of the law. However, [one pauses] to mention (parenthetically) that,
                        whilst there is the need for the consideration as well as citation of
                        academic writings, there is also the need for such writings to be <em>relevant</em> inasmuch as, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, esoteric and/or highly abstract discourse ought to be
                        avoided. In other words, whilst academic writings must always maintain their
                        intellectual rigour, it must never be forgotten that their <em>highest</em> calling (and achievement) consists, in the
                        final analysis, in their contribution to the legal <em>profession</em> as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, legal doctrine is not an end itself. Its
                        primary function is to guide the court, in a reasoned fashion, to arrive at
                            <em>a fair result</em> in the case before it. Here,
                        too, academic literature has a potentially significant (perhaps even
                        pivotal) role to play. This is because, in some quarters, there has
                            - particularly with the advent of postmodern legal
                        thought - been an increased (and, unfortunately,
                        increasingly) skeptical view taken of the law in general and legal
                        objectivity in particular. Such an approach is, on any view, both corrosive
                        as well as destructive. Whilst one cannot deny that the <em>application</em> of objective rules and principles is a <em>dynamic process</em> which may therefore give rise (on
                        occasion at least) to some unpredictability as well as uncertainty
                        (particularly in an imperfect world), it is certainly the <em>very antithesis</em> of the law to argue that the law is wholly
                        subjective and that (putting it crudely) ‘anything goes’.
                        Indeed, as [was] observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private
                            Ltd</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is important to stress that notwithstanding many academic
                            critiques to the effect that commercial certainty and predictability are
                            chimerical, it cannot be gainsaid that the <em>perception</em> of their importance is deeply entrenched
                            within the commercial legal landscape in general and in the individual
                            psyches of commercial parties (and even non-commercial parties, for that
                            matter) in particular. It may be worth observing that most of these
                            critiques stem from a radical view of the law. To put it bluntly, many
                            of such views stem from the premise that objectivity of the law is not
                            merely elusive but positively illusory. In particular, such a sceptical
                            approach is based on the idea that everything is subjective. This is, of
                            course, the very antithesis of the very enterprise of the law itself.
                            Such an approach also conveniently misses its own absolute cast.
                            Unfortunately, though, it is an absolute view that dispirits and
                            disempowers. It is profoundly negative and ought to be avoided at all
                            costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, the view that the law is subjective (and, consequently, arbitrary)
                        would cause an irreparable loss in the <em>legitimacy</em> of the law in the eyes of <em>the
                            public</em>. And, as just mentioned, it would also dispirit as

                        the very view that all law is subjective is <em>itself</em> an ‘absolute’ proposition that thus

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In summary, although the process of the
                    implication of terms does involve the concept of interpretation, it entails a
                        <em>specific form or conception </em><em>of interpretation</em> which is <em>separate and
                        distinct from</em> the <em>more general</em>
                    process of interpretation (in particular, interpretation of the <em>express</em> terms of a particular document). Indeed, the
                    process of the implication of terms <em>necessarily</em>
                    involves a situation where it is precisely because the <em>express</em> term(s) are <em>missing</em> that
                    the court is compelled to ascertain the presumed intention of the parties via
                    the “business efficacy” and the “officious
                    bystander” tests (both of which are premised on the concept of
                    necessity). In this context, terms will not be implied easily or lightly.
                    Neither does the court imply terms based on its idea of what it thinks <em>ought</em> to be the contractual relationship between the
                    contracting parties. The court is concerned only with the <em>presumed</em> intention of the contracting parties because it can
                    ascertain the <em>subjective</em> intention of the
                    contracting parties <em>only</em> through <em>the objective evidence which is available before it</em> in
                    the case concerned. <em>In our view, therefore, although
                        the</em> Belize <em>test is helpful in reminding us of
                        the importance of the general </em><em>concept of
                        interpretation (and its accompanying emphasis on the need for objective
                        evidence), we would respectfully reject that </em><em>test in so far as it suggests that the traditional “business
                        efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests are not
                        central to the implication of terms. On the contrary, both these tests
                        (premised as they are on the concept of necessity) are an integral as well
                        as indispensable part of the law relating to implied terms in
                        Singapore</em> (as noted above at [27]-[28])<em>.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Indeed, a survey of the English case law as
                    well as academic literature since the <em>Belize</em> test
                    was first promulgated will reveal what seems to us to be an overall ambiguity
                    (particularly in the former) and no small measure of negative critique of that
                    test (particularly in the latter).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Turning, first, to the English case law,
                    although <em>Belize</em> has been cited in a fair number of
                    cases, it is by no means clear that both the “business efficacy”
                    and the “officious bystander” tests have been relegated to the
                    sidelines of the English law relating to terms implied “in fact”.
                    Indeed, in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Stena Line
                        Limited v P &amp; O Ferries Limited</em> [2010] EWCA Civ 543
                        (“<em>Stena Line</em>”), Arden LJ
                    (with whom both Toulson and Rimer LJJ agreed), whilst of the view (at [36])
                    that “[t]he <em>Belize</em> case constitutes an
                    important and recent development in the principles of interpretation”
                    also expressed the view that that decision was one “which the courts are
                    probably still absorbing and ingesting”. More importantly, the learned
                    judge also observed (at [44]) that “[t]he <em>implications</em> of <em>Belize</em> on the case
                    law on implied terms, which puts forward the different formulae referred to
                    above, <em>is not wholly clear</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. Although the court in <em>Stena Line</em> did
                    nevertheless appear to apply the <em>Belize</em> test,
                    there did not seem to be any definitive pronouncement on the precise status of
                    the “business efficacy” and “officious bystander”
                    tests post-<em>Belize</em>. In a related vein, Davies was
                    of the view that the court in <em>Mediterranean Salvage and
                        Towage</em> was not at all enthusiastic with the <em>Belize</em> test (see <em>Davies</em> at
                    p 147). The English High Court decision of <em>Spencer and
                        another v Secretary of State for Defence</em> [2012] 2 All ER
                    (Comm) 480 might also be usefully noted. In that case, although Vos J
                    embarked on an comprehensive survey of the relevant precedents and purported to
                    apply the <em>Belize</em> test, the learned judge did also
                    observe as follows (at [52] and [96]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The other cases after the <em>A-G of Belize</em> case
                        do not entirely speak with one voice: some seem to consider that Lord
                        Hoffmann was merely encapsulating the existing law, and others recognise the
                        case as a persuasive departure from what was thought to be the law on
                        implied terms up until 2009. Mr McCaughran’s article expresses
                        forcefully the latter view, whilst Lord Grabiner’s article
                        ((2012) 128 LQR 41, pp 58-61) declines to recognise any
                        substantive change at all. Many of the subsequent cases do not really take
                        the matter much further, but for the sake of completeness, I will mention
                        the more important passages from each of them.</p>

                    reasonable person test has (as we have noted above) been pitched at too general
                    a level of abstraction and recourse must therefore be had to the more specific
                    criteria embodied in both the “business efficacy” and
                    “officious bystander” tests, then we would be back to
                    “square one”, so to speak.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We would add that in so far as the case law
                    merely refers to <em>Belize</em> as encompassing the
                    concept of interpretation or construction (see, for example, the English High
                    Court decision of <em>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company v Svenska
                        </em><em>Cellulosa </em><em>Aktiebolaget</em> [2012] EWHC 498 (Ch) (at [8])), this is, with
                    respect, also unhelpful. As we have noted above, the process of the implication
                    of terms is neither incompatible nor inconsistent with the concept of
                    interpretation or construction. However, this does not answer the more specific
                    issue which we have raised and dealt with above, <em>viz</em>, the true nature of the process of the implication of terms
                    and the centrality of the “business efficacy” and
                    “officious bystander” tests in this process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally, turning to the academic literature,
                    although Sir Kim Lewison has observed (in Kim Lewison, <em>The Interpretation of Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    5th Ed, 2011) at para 6.03) that <em>Belize</em>
                    “has now been referred to many times as the starting point for deciding
                    whether a term should be implied into a contract” and that “[i]t
                    may be taken to represent the current state of the law of England and
                    Wales”, that decision has by no means been unequivocally and uniformly
                    endorsed in the academic literature itself. In fairness, there are comments on
                        <em>Belize</em> which are very favourable (see, for
                    example, Kelvin F K Low &amp; Kelry C F Loi,
                    “The Many “Tests” for Terms Implied in Fact: Welcome
                    Clarity” (2009) 125 LQR 561 (“<em>Low &amp; Loi</em>”) and Chris Peters, “The
                    Implication of Terms in Fact” [2009] CLJ 513 (“<em>Peters</em>”)). However, despite their endorsement of the
                        <em>Belize</em> test, the learned authors of the first
                    piece just cited do nevertheless point to the difficulty in effecting the
                    gap-filling <em>via</em> implied terms (see <em>Low &amp; Loi</em> at pp 566–567). The
                    “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests
                    do constitute the means by which such gap-filling is effected and are, as
                    explained above, more specific and particular than (as well as different from)
                    the broad concept of interpretation. As importantly, perhaps, it is significant
                    to note that the author of the second piece has noted that the <em>Belize</em> test “also appears to represent something
                    of <em>a departure from</em> the traditional focus on
                        <em>necessity</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Peters</em> at p 514) – a departure which, as
                    already noted above (at [33]), is not an approach that ought to be adopted in
                    the context of terms “implied in fact”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     More importantly, there is also commentary
                    that is in fact quite critical of the <em>Belize</em> test,
                    as exemplified, for example, by an article to which we have already referred
                    (see generally <em>Davies</em> as well as above at [31]).
                    Another author also expresses the view that the <em>Belize</em> test might be too liberal, introducing (implied) terms
                    which do not in fact fulfil the intentions of the contracting parties (see
                    generally Elizabeth Mcdonald, “Casting Aside ‘Officious
                    Bystanders’ and ‘Business Efficacy’?” (2009)
                    26 JCL 97). We would, finally, observe that there is yet other commentary
                    which adopts a neutral stance as between the <em>Belize</em> test on the one hand and the traditional “business
                    efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests on the other
                    (see, for example, <em>McCaughran</em>; <em>cf</em> also Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of
                        Contract</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2011),

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In summary, therefore, neither the English
                    case law nor the academic literature furnishes clear support for the <em>Belize</em> test. The entire picture is mixed at best and
                    ambiguous at worst, and constitutes further support for the approach adopted by
                    this court (set out above at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We turn now to consider (applying both the
                    “business efficacy” as well as “officious bystander”
                    tests) whether a term conferring a power on the Management Committee to remove
                    office bearers may be implied in the Rules. The Appellants’ case was
                    simply that he who appoints an office bearer, <em>ie</em>,
                    the Management Committee, must necessarily also have the power to remove this
                    office bearer. It was also argued that the Rules did not specify the term of
                    office for the office bearers in the Executive Committee; if a power of removal
                    were not implied, it would mean that the office bearers could remain in office
                    indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We were not persuaded by the Appellants’
                    argument, and considered that the <em>overall context</em>
                    of the Rules pointed to a contrary conclusion. The purpose of the Rules is to
                    set out the rights and obligations of the members <em>inter
                        se</em> and to create an effective governance structure that would
                    enable the Association to achieve its objectives, listed in Rule 3, of
                    promoting the welfare of the Hainanese community and fostering interaction and a
                    sense of identity amongst the community. Rules 12(1) and 15 vest the
                    overall mandate to conduct and manage the affairs of the Association in the
                    Management Committee as a whole, and the Executive Committee – which
                    consists of all the office bearers – carries out the day to day running of
                    the Association under the general instruction of the Management Committee.
                    Rule 9 sets out the procedure for the election of office bearers, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>RULE 9</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The elected Management Committee Members shall elect amongst
                        themselves by secret ballots the President, the three Vice-President and the
                        heads and deputy heads of the ten committee [sic].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The post of President and the posts of respective Vice-Presidents
                        shall not be held by the same person for more than two consecutive terms.
                        The Honorary Treasurer/Deputy Honorary Treasurer and the Internal Auditors
                        shall not be immediately re-elected to the same or related positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Rules are silent on the removal of office bearers. Rule 19,
                    however, provides for the expulsion of members by the Management Committee for
                    misconduct, and also prescribes certain procedural safeguards and voting
                    majorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was clear to us that both the
                    “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests
                    were not satisfied, and that this implied power of removal could not therefore
                    have been part of the presumed intentions of the members. We did not think it
                    was necessary for the effective management of the Association’s affairs
                    for the Management Committee to be given the power to remove particular office
                    bearers. The Management Committee still retains the decisive power to supervise
                    the conduct of the office bearers, manage finances and to formulate the general
                    policy direction for the Association. We were cognisant of the fact that many
                    clubs and unincorporated associations, unlike companies, are run on a non-profit
                    basis and many office bearers take on positions of responsibility on a voluntary
                    basis. While it is conceivable that a change in leadership may sometimes be
                    desirable, we did not think that it was <em>necessary</em>
                    for leadership change to be effected through a blunt power of removal wielded
                    exclusively by the Management Committee, instead of through sensible compromise
                    and consensus. It was also noted that the First Respondent averred that it was
                    the first time in the 157-year history of the Association that a President had
                    been removed before the expiry of his term of office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> While we accept that there is
                    always a first time when unanticipated problems arise and that this does not
                        <em>per se</em> mean that a term conferring a power of
                    removal is unnecessary, in this particular factual context, it did suggest that
                    the Association is capable of governing itself within the existing framework set
                    out in the Rules without an ad-hoc gap filling mechanism in the form of the
                    implied term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, the power of removal was not, in our
                    view, so obvious that it would go without saying that such a term ought to be
                    implied under the “officious bystander” test. The Rules include
                    specific rules governing the removal of trustees and expulsion of members for
                    misconduct (see Rules 14 and 19, respectively) and therefore contemplate
                    the possibility that individuals with certain positions of responsibility or
                    members may need to be removed in the interests of the Association. It is thus
                    difficult to believe that the members did not advert themselves to the
                    possibility of removal of office bearers or did not expressly say so because
                    they had considered it so obvious that it would go without saying. We also do
                    not think that the members would have considered it obvious that the Management
                    Committee itself should have free rein to remove an office bearer. The members
                    could have preferred the power of removal to be vested in the General Meeting or
                    for the power to be exercised only when stringent voting margins or procedural
                    pre-conditions are met; alternatively, as the Judge observed, the members could
                    equally have intended that this apparent “gap” in the Rules should
                    mean precisely that office bearers cannot be removed and must be allowed to
                    serve out their complete two-year term of office in order to ensure stability
                    and continuity in the management of the Association. The Appellants submitted to
                    us that the Judge’s reasoning on this point was flawed because the Rules
                    did not expressly provide for a fixed term of office for an office bearer, but
                    we were unable to agree with the Appellants’ – somewhat ironically
                    – unduly literal interpretation of this aspect of the Rules. Rather, a
                    purposive interpretation of Rule 9 in conjunction with Rule 7, which
                    provides for a two-year term of office for Management Committee members,
                    indicates that the term of office for an office bearer must logically also be
                    two years. An office bearer elected from amongst the members of the Management
                    Committee can only be an office bearer for as long as he is also a Management
                    Committee member, and his term as an office bearer must therefore necessarily
                    also be limited by his term as a Management Committee member. If an office
                    bearer were to have an indefinite term of office, it would clearly contradict
                    the express purpose of Rule 9(2), which places restrictions on office
                    bearers occupying the same position for <em>consecutive
                        terms</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Indeed, if the officious bystander had asked
                    whether the Management Committee had the power to remove the office bearers at
                    will, the members would not have unequivocally thought that the term was
                    obviously necessary for the effective management of Association and unanimously
                    suppressed him with a testy “Oh, of course!” The limited term of
                    office – both for office bearers and members of the Management Committee
                    – ensures that control of the Association will not always fall into the
                    hands of a single individual, and a fixed period of office without the threat of
                    removal encourages consensus and unity, instead of divisive power struggles and
                    acrimony. If the Management Committee or general members have irreconcilable
                    differences with a particular office bearer, the solution is to vote him out at
                    the next election for a new Management Committee and/or office bearers. And, if
                    an office bearer has behaved in a particularly egregious manner, the last resort
                    would and should be expulsion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We hence declined to imply a term conferring a
                    power on the Management Committee to remove office bearers in the Executive
                    Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The validity of the 20 October 2011 Meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Respondents submitted that the
                    20 October 2011 Meeting was invalid as Foo Jong Peng did not have power
                    under the Rules to convene a Management Committee meeting. It was argued that
                    only the President was vested with the authority to do so under Rule 17 and
                    that this position was in line with the Association’s “customary
                    practice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Rule 17 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>RULE 17</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The President shall have <em>the authority to deal with
                            all matters</em> except that he shall only have the power to
                        authorise the expenditure of any sum of money not exceeding $5000.00 per
                        month in respect of any one matter not provided for in the budget.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The President and, in his absence, the respective Vice-Presidents
                        shall preside in all General, Management and Executive Committee
                        meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Rules do not set out the procedures to be followed for convening a
                    Management Committee meeting, apart from specifying who should chair the meeting
                    and the required quorum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We disagreed with the Respondents that the
                    effect of Rule 17 was to confer <em>exclusive
                        power</em> on the President to convene a Management Committee meeting.
                    Rule 17(1) is simply an enabling provision that gives the President
                        <em>authority to </em><em>act on
                        behalf</em> of the Association on all matters, subject to a monetary
                    limit for the authorisation of expenditure, and we could not construe this
                    provision so broadly so as to give <em>exclusive power</em>
                    to the President to decide on <em>residual</em> matters
                    relating to the affairs of the Management Committee or the Association that are
                    not explicitly provided for in the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In our view, there were no discernable
                    procedural limitations in the Rules mandating that Management Committee meetings
                    could only be convened by the President. The internal administration procedures
                    of unincorporated associations are usually conducted on an informal and flexible
                    basis, and the Rules do not set out any decision-making hierarchy within the
                    Management Committee. It may be that an office bearer such as the President or
                    Honorary Secretary General will generally be responsible for convening a meeting
                    as a matter of administrative convenience, but it is an entirely separate
                    proposition altogether to state that other members of the Management Committee
                    do not have the <em>legal power</em> to convene a meeting
                    even with the requisite notice. The Management Committee is constitutionally
                    entrusted with the general duties and powers to administer the affairs of the
                    Association, and each elected Management Committee member has an equal
                    responsibility to participate in meetings and contribute to the decision-making
                    process of the Management Committee. The authors of David
                    Ashton &amp; Paul W. Reid, <em>Ashton and
                        Reid on Club Law</em> (Jordan Publishing, 2005) observe, as follows
                    (at para 6-36):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [If] through indolence or neglect or for any other reason, no
                        committee meeting was convened when plainly it should have been, we consider
                        that any member of the committee would probably have an inherent right to
                        convene a committee meeting on reasonable notice; otherwise the management
                        and control of the club’s affairs would become rudderless, to the
                        obvious detriment of the club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We thus considered that any member of the Management Committee may
                    convene a meeting upon reasonable notice, and, accordingly, the 20 October
                    2011 Meeting was validly convened by Foo Jong Peng. We would add that this power
                    is not a disruptive one that can be abused by an individual member to call
                    needlessly frequent meetings for vexatious purposes, with other members being
                    compelled to attend at the risk of careless decisions being made in their
                    absence. The 50% quorum required for a Management Committee meeting under
                    Rule 13 ensures that at least a majority of Management Committee members
                    must be present, and if superfluous meetings are convened, they are likely to be
                    inquorate and invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For completeness, we would note that the
                    Respondents also advanced an argument that it was the “customary
                    practice” of the Association that only the President had the power to
                    convene a Management Committee meeting. This argument was only canvassed briefly
                    in the court below and without the citation of authority. In <em>Golden Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Limited v Golden Village Multiplex
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 940, this court accepted (at [39])
                    that it was in principle possible to invoke past practice to fill in gaps in the
                    articles of association of a company; however, concrete evidence must be adduced
                    to show that this practice was “the unvarying course” of the
                    company (<em>In re Imperial Mercantile Credit Association
                        (Marino’s Case)</em> (1867) LR 2 Ch App 596 at 598
                        <em>per</em> Sir G J Turner LJ).
                    The only evidence before us on such “past practice” was the
                    correspondence included in the Respondents’ affidavits documenting an
                    isolated incident in June 2009 where the then Honorary Secretary General and
                    another Management Committee meeting had expressed the view that only the
                    President, acting upon the advice of other key office bearers, had the power to
                    convene a Management Committee meeting. This was insufficient for us to conclude
                    that the Management Committee had, as a matter of course, always acted upon this
                    convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal
                    substantially as the Appellants had not succeeded on their key contention,
                        <em>ie</em>, that the Management Committee had the
                    power to remove an office bearer of the Executive Committee. Costs here and
                    below were fixed at $25,000 in favour of the Respondents, inclusive of
