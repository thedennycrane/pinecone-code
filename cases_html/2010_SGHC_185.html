<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application (“the
                    Application”) by the defendant, Drydocks World-Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Drydocks”) (formerly known as Pan-United Shipyard Pte Ltd), for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, a stay of Suit No 757 of 2009
                    (“the Action”) filed by the plaintiff, Jurong Port Pte Ltd
                    (“Jurong Port”), on three alternative grounds, <em>viz</em>, s 6 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev
                    Ed), the inherent jurisdiction of the court, and the pending arbitration
                    proceedings between the parties on the same dispute. Jurong Port resists the
                    Application in its entirety, although its general counsel, Mr Lim Tat Kuan
                    (“Mr Lim”) deposed that Jurong Port is willing to accept a
                    stay if the court should impose a condition on the stay, <em>viz</em>, that Drydocks waives its right to argue any defence based
                    on the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) that is premised upon a
                    limitation period expiring on or after 4 September 2009 (<em>ie</em>, the date of the commencement of the Action).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This judgment contains my decision, as well as
                    brief reasons for my decision. In this judgment, for convenience, the
                    term/condition that the limitation defence be waived in arbitration proceedings
                    will hereafter be referred to as “the Condition” and the
                    term/condition that Jurong Port seeks (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) will hereafter be referred to as “the Modified
                    Condition”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Jurong Port and Drydocks entered into three
                    separate contracts on 30 June 2000, 14 March 2001 and 29 January
                    2003. For ease of reference, the three contracts will hereafter be referred to,
                    respectively, as “the 2000 Contract”, “the 2001
                    Contract” and “the 2003 Contract”, and, collectively, as
                    “the Contracts”. Pursuant to the Contracts, Drydocks was to
                    design, supply, install and commission nine quay cranes (“the
                    Cranes”). The 2000 Contract and 2001 Contract incorporated, <em>inter alia</em>, the July 1999 edition of the Public Sector
                    Standard Conditions of Contract for Construction Works. The 2003 Contract
                    incorporated, <em>inter alia</em>, the May 2001 edition of
                    the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract for Design and
                Build.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Contracts each contained a number of clauses
                    that dealt with dispute resolution. The pertinent clauses for present purposes
                    (“the Clauses”), which are identical in each of the Contracts, are
                    as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By about 2004, the Cranes were delivered and put
                    into operation by Jurong Port. In 2007, Jurong Port discovered certain defects
                    in the Cranes, and entered into negotiations with Drydocks for the rectification
                    of the defects. As Drydocks took no steps to rectify the defects, Jurong Port
                    engaged third-party contractors in August 2007 to carry out repair work on the
                    Cranes. Following the completion of the repairs in or around April 2009, Jurong
                    Port entered into negotiations with Drydocks for compensation for the costs of
                    the repairs. Further defects in the Cranes were subsequently discovered. On
                    4 September 2009, Jurong Port commenced the Action in order to
                    “ensure that it did not fall foul of any limitation periods that may be
                    applicable to its claim”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The writ was served on 3 March
                    2010. Drydocks filed its memorandum of appearance on 10 March 2010. In the
                    statement of claim, which was filed on 19 April 2010, Jurong Port pleaded
                    that defects had been discovered in the Cranes in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and
                    claimed damages from Drydocks on the basis of negligence, breach of contract,
                    breach of warranty, as well as misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 7 December 2009, Jurong Port referred
                    the matter to the respective Superintending Officers under the Contracts –
                    Ms Mao Whey Ying (“Ms Mao”) for the 2000 Contract
                    (Drydocks seemed to question her status in its letter to her dated 8 April
                    2010 (see, also, <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> below)), Mr Fong
                    Yue Kwong (“Mr Fong”) for the 2001 Contract and Mr Tan
                    Kok Bin (“Mr Tan”) for the 2003 Contract – for their
                    decision (pursuant to the Clauses (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>
                    above)). On 19 January 2010, Mr Fong appointed Mr Tan to decide
                    on the issues arising out of the 2001 Contract. Mr Tan rendered his
                    decisions on the issues arising out of the 2001 Contract and the 2003 Contract
                    on 21 January 2010 and 19 January 2010 respectively. In his decisions,
                    he held, <em>inter alia</em>, that Drydocks was to
                    compensate Jurong Port for the sums of $1,191,652 (in relation to the 2001
                    Contract) and $2,793,266.53 (in relation to the 2003 Contract). In its reply to
                    Mr Tan on his decisions, Drydocks stated, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the decisions had not been rendered before the
                    contractual deadline of 30 days for the decisions (found in the Clauses (see
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)) had expired and the decisions
                    were therefore not final and binding. On 5 March 2010, Drydocks issued a
                    notice of arbitration (pursuant to the Clauses (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)) with respect to Mr Tan’s
                    decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Ms Mao, on her part, advised the parties,
                    in a letter dated 5 January 2010 that was addressed to Jurong Port and
                    copied to Drydocks, to jointly appoint an independent assessor for the
                    establishment of the material facts and evidence. The parties subsequently
                    entered into discussions on a joint appointment of an independent assessor. On
                    8 April 2010, Drydocks wrote to Ms Mao to inform her that the parties
                    could not reach an agreement <em>vis-a-vis</em> the
                    appointment of an independent assessor, and also asked her whether she would be
                    rendering a decision on the issues arising out of the 2000 Contract. Ms Mao
                    failed to reply, and on 22 April 2010, Drydocks wrote to Ms Mao to ask
                    her to render a decision within three days, failing which, it would proceed on
                    the basis that she would not be rendering a decision. On 27 April 2010,
                    Drydocks received a letter dated 22 April 2010 from Ms Mao, which
                    stated that the “opinion and response as expressed in [the] letter dated
                    5 [January] 2010 to Jurong Port on the same issue remain”. On
                    29 April 2010, Drydocks issued a notice of arbitration (pursuant to the
                    Clauses (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)) in regard to the
                    issues arising out of the 2000 Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was not denied that arbitration proceedings
                    had been commenced with respect to the entire dispute between the parties
                    following the issuance of the two notices of arbitration (“the Notices of
                    Arbitration”) by Drydocks. On each of the two different occasions that
                    Drydocks issued the Notices of Arbitration to Jurong Port, Drydocks
                    concomitantly invited Jurong Port to discontinue the Action. In a letter dated
                    11 March 2010, Jurong Port offered to discontinue the Action, provided that
                    Drydocks gave its agreement to the Condition. In another letter dated
                    19 March 2010, Jurong Port offered to discontinue the Action, provided that
                    Drydocks gave its agreement to the Modified Condition. However, Drydocks did not
                    agree to either the Condition or the Modified Condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The main submissions of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Drydocks submitted that the Action should be
                    stayed pursuant to s 6 of the Arbitration Act. In support of this
                    submission, Drydocks pointed out that the dispute is subject to valid
                    arbitration agreements between the parties, pleadings had not been delivered and
                    no other step in the proceedings had been taken, it was and still remains ready
                    and willing to proceed with arbitration, and no sufficient reasons exist to show
                    that the dispute should not be referred to arbitration. Drydocks submitted, in
                    the alternative, that the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to
                    stay the Action or should stay the Action on the basis of the pending
                    arbitration proceedings on the dispute. Drydocks also submitted that the court
                    should not grant a stay with the Modified Condition. In support of this
                    submission, Drydocks distinguished the present case from two cases in which the
                    Condition was imposed (<em>viz</em>, <em>The
                        Xanadu</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 360 and <em>The
                        Duden</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 984), and argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that no special circumstances exist to
                    justify the imposition of the Modified Condition, no hardship or prejudice would
                    be suffered by Jurong Port if the Modified Condition is not imposed, and any
                    hardship suffered by Jurong Point if the Modified Condition is not imposed
                    should be considered to be self-induced hardship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Jurong Port submitted that a stay of the
                    Action should not be granted. The main reason provided in support was that there
                    could be “possible issues of limitation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Its case for breach of
                    warranty would probably be unaffected, as the breach in question should be
                    considered to be a continuing breach. However, its receipt of the Notices of
                    Arbitration, which had the effect of stopping time from running for the purposes
                    of limitation periods (pursuant to ss 9 and 11(1) of the Arbitration Act),
                    might have occurred more than three years after the initial discovery of defects
                    in the Cranes and this could give rise to limitation issues, having regard to
                    s 24A of the Limitation Act (which prescribes, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a limitation period of three years for certain types of
                    actions). With reference to <em>The Escherscheim</em>
                    [1976] 1 WLR 339, the following was submitted:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been held that the court would exercise its discretion to refuse a

                        the arbitration ineffective by raising the [limitation] defence in the
                        arbitration (which would not arise in the legal proceedings).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Jurong Port submitted, in the alternative,
                    that any stay that is granted should be a conditional stay, <em>ie</em>, a stay with the Modified Condition. In support of this
                    submission, Jurong Port argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    Drydocks had never really disputed liability, the Clauses only allow a party who
                    is dissatisfied with a decision of the Superintending Officer to refer the
                    dispute to arbitration and Drydocks had delayed in so doing, and an
                    unconditional stay could result in Jurong Port being deprived of its claim.
                    Jurong Port further emphasised that it was acting reasonably in asking for the
                    Modified Condition, rather than the Condition, to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 6 of the Arbitration Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Under s 6(1) of the Arbitration Act,
                    where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes court proceedings against
                    another party to the same agreement for a matter that falls within the scope of
                    the agreement, any of the parties to the agreement may, after entering
                    appearance but before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the
                    proceedings, apply to the court for a stay of the court proceedings relating to
                    that matter. Under s 6(2), the court has the discretion to grant a stay
                        (<em>cf</em>, s 6(2) of the International
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)), and will do so if satisfied
                    that “there is no sufficient reason” for not referring the matter
                    to arbitration and the party applying for a stay was and remains “ready
                    and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the
                    arbitration”. Sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the Arbitration Act, in full,
                    would be as follows:</p>

                        of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Jurong Port did not contest the fact that the
                    dispute is subject to arbitration agreements between the parties, that Drydocks
                    had not taken any other step in the proceedings, and that Drydocks was and
                    remains ready and willing to proceed with arbitration. Jurong Port did, however,
                    argue that the court should exercise its discretion not to grant a stay. It is
                    trite law that the party opposing a stay in favour of arbitration bears the
                    burden of showing that there is sufficient reason why the matter should not be
                    referred to arbitration (see <em>JDC Corp and another v
                        Lightweight Concrete Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 96 at
                    [10]). That said, it has been observed in one treatise that “[t]he
                    presumption is in favour of a stay” and that “[i]n practice there
                    are very few grounds which have been held to justify a refusal of a stay”
                    (see Robert Merkin &amp; Johanna Hjalmarsson, <em>Singapore
                        Arbitration Legislation</em> (Informa, 2009) at
                    pp 131–132). It could be added that there is no general rule that the
                    court, as Jurong Port seems to suggests (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), should exercise its discretion to refuse a stay if
                    the ensuing arbitration proceedings would be rendered ineffective by issues of
                    limitation that would not have arisen if court proceedings had continued.
                    Indeed, it has been observed in another treatise that the fact that “an
                    arbitration will be out of time is not in itself a ground for refusing a
                    stay” (see Sir Michael J Mustill &amp; Stewart C Boyd, <em>Commercial Arbitration</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1989) at
                    p 477).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Under s 6(2) of the Arbitration Act, the
                    court is allowed to grant a stay “upon such terms as the court thinks
                    fit” (“the AA phrase”). Pursuant to the AA phrase, Jurong
                    Port has urged the court to order, at most, a conditional stay, <em>ie</em>, a stay with the Modified Condition. This express
                    averment to a power to grant a stay of proceedings on terms/conditions was
                    included in the re-enactment of the Arbitration Act in 2001 (as Act 37 of
                    2001 (the precursor to the present version of the Arbitration Act)). Prior to
                    that, only the International Arbitration Act (first enacted as Act 23 of
                    1994) contained a similar phrase, <em>viz</em>, in
                    s 6(2), which stated (and continues to state) that the court can grant a
                    stay “upon such terms or conditions as it may think fit”
                    (“the IAA phrase”). Counsel for both parties submitted that there
                    is no local case law on the AA phrase. They were, however, in agreement that the
                    leading cases on the IAA phrase, <em>The Xanadu</em> and
                        <em>The Duden</em>, were instructive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>The Xanadu</em>,
                    Lai Kew Chai J held (at [6]) that the court would be “entitled to
                    impose terms and conditions as appear reasonable or required by the ties of
                    justice”. In that case, an assistant registrar had stayed court
                    proceedings in favour of arbitration, and also imposed the Condition. Lai J
                    upheld the decision to impose the Condition on appeal, stating (at [6]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the following reasons, I would go further and state that I would have
                        imposed the same condition [ie, the Condition] in the circumstances of this
                        case. Firstly, there was, at the least, sufficient ambiguity which was
                        reasonably entertained by the plaintiffs on the question whether the
                        relevant bill of lading had identified the arbitration clause which was
                        invoked. It was therefore reasonable for the plaintiffs to have commenced
                        these admiralty proceedings. Secondly, the defendants waited until after
                        early September 1996, after the expiry of the time bar, before they filed
                        their application on 20 September 1996 to stay these proceedings. It
                        was noteworthy that the statement of claim was filed on 13 August 1996.
                        Thirdly, if the condition was not imposed, the plaintiffs would suffer undue
                        and disproportionate hardship, seeing that their claim is in excess of
                        US$222,518.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lai J’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in Civil
                    Appeal No 139 of 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>The Duden</em>,
                    Andrew Ang J dismissed an appeal against the decision of an assistant
                    registrar, who ordered a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration and
                    imposed the Condition. The stay application filed by the defendants was based on
                    a bill of lading, which provided for, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the incorporation of an arbitration agreement that was to be found in an
                    unidentified charterparty. The vagueness <em>vis-a-vis</em>
                    the identity of the charterparty ultimately resulted in the plaintiffs only
                    becoming aware of the terms of the arbitration agreement after the limitation
                    period in question had expired. In the opinion of Ang J, the circumstances
                    “demanded” the imposition of the Condition (at [23]). In the
                    earlier parts of his grounds of decision, Ang J elucidated the following
                    principles in relation to the imposition of terms/conditions pursuant to the IAA
                    phrase (at [12]–[16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    The discretion of the court to impose terms and
                            conditions upon a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration is
                                an<em> unfettered discretion</em>. This
                            was the view of Lai Siu Chiu J in<em> Splosna
                                Plovba International Shipping and Chartering d o o v Adria Orient
                                Line Pte Ltd </em>[1998] SGHC 289.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    With respect, Lai J’s opinion appears to
                            me to be in accord with the intention of the Legislature.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    That having been said, discretionary power must, of
                            course, be exercised judiciously. The corollary to a wide discretionary
                            power is the great caution with which it should be exercised.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    The main guiding principle in my view is that
                            courts generally should be slow to interfere in the arbitration process.
                            In recent years, courts have moved from strong uncertainty as to the
                            arbitration process resulting in extensive judicial interference or the
                            non-enforcement of arbitration agreements to a position in favour of
                                arbitration,<em> ie</em> deferring to
                            party autonomy and avoiding intervention where possible (Julian D M
                            Lew, Loukas A Mistelis &amp; Stefan M Kröll,<em> Comparative International Commercial
                            Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law International, 2003) at p
                            356).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    Nevertheless, in a case such as this, the court
                            should not be reluctant to intervene by exercising its statutory power
                            to impose conditions where the justice of the case calls for it.
                            … But even then, a condition imposed as to the waiver of a
                            defence of time bar [<em>ie</em>, the Condition]
                            can only be justified in “very special circumstances as it takes
                            away a substantive right of one of the parties” (see the
                            commentary on<em> The
                                Xanadu</em> in<em> Halsbury’s
                                Laws of Singapore</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue)

<p class="Judg-1">Ang J’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in Civil
                    Appeal No 123 of 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, the same principles enunciated in
                        <em>The Xanadu</em> and <em>The
                        Duden</em> should be applicable in the present case, notwithstanding
                    the fact that the present case concerns the AA phrase as opposed to the IAA
                    phrase. At the hearing, counsel for Jurong Port argued (although without much
                    elaboration) that the policy considerations underlying the Arbitration Act,
                    which are different from the policy considerations underlying the International
                    Arbitration Act, should mean that the court should take a less strict approach
                    when considering whether terms/conditions should be imposed pursuant to the AA
                    phrase. In my view, this argument is not entirely sound. To begin with, it has
                    been observed that although the court has “a somewhat wider role and
                    broader judicial latitude in domestic arbitration ... this is to be exercised in
                    a <em>guarded manner</em>” [emphasis added] (see the
                    grounds of decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Tjong Very
                        Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 732 at [31]). It has also been observed that the Arbitration
                    Act and the International Arbitration Act “ought, as far as the statutory
                    language allows, to be <em>read consistently</em> because
                    both statutes, taken together, comprise the entire arbitration regime available
                    in Singapore” [emphasis added] (see the grounds of decision of the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete
                        Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 565

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It should be added that both the Arbitration
                    Act and the International Arbitration Act have significant similarities, and
                    that both are based largely on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
                    Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                    Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 at col 2214 (Assoc

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is clear that Parliament intended that the [Arbitration] Act (as
                        recently amended in 2002) should largely mirror the IAA [<em>ie</em>, the International Arbitration Act] and international
                        practices reflected in the Model Law save that the courts have been vested
                        with more supervisory powers in the case of domestic arbitrations: see
                        Second Reading of the Arbitration Bill (Bill 37 of 2001) on 5 October
                        2001 (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                            Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 at
                        col 2213).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Also, in <em>NCC International</em>, the Court of
                    Appeal observed (at [23]–[25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    The powers of the
                            Singapore courts in respect of international arbitration are therefore
                            listed exhaustively in the IAA [<em>ie</em>, the
                            International Arbitration Act] where matters governed by the Model Law
                            are concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    In respect of
                            domestic arbitration, Singapore brought its regime in line with that
                            under the Model Law by enacting the Arbitration Act 2001
                            (Act 37 of 2001) (“the 2001 Act”), the immediate
                            precursor of the AA [<em>ie</em>, the Arbitration
                            Act]. The 2001 Act was largely based on the Model Law, but also
                            incorporated useful features from the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK)
                            …: see Law Reform and Revision Division, Attorney-General’s
                            Chambers, <em>Review of Arbitration
                            Laws</em> (LRRD No 3/2001) … at para 4.3.
                            The purpose of this approach, as stated in <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                            Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 at
                            col 2214 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law),
                            was to allow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... the creation of an arbitration regime that is in line with
                            international standards and yet preserves key features of those existing
                            arbitration practices that are deemed to be desirable for domestic
                            arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    Hence, the AA (which is substantially similar to
                            the 2001 Act) shares a common bedrock with the IAA, including the
                            preservation of commercial certainty by limiting curial intervention,
                            but with certain modifications tailored to suit domestic
                            arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     That said, in my view, there is no reason why
                    the approach of the court towards the imposition of terms/conditions pursuant to
                    the AA phrase ought to be any different from the approach taken towards the
                    imposition of terms/conditions pursuant to the IAA phrase. Parenthetically, it
                    could be added that the fact that the AA phrase is found within a framework
                    which allows the court to exercise discretion in granting stays while the IAA
                    phrase is found within a framework which does not allow the court to exercise
                    discretion in granting stays (upon the fulfillment of certain criteria) is not,
                    in itself, a sufficient indication that Parliament had intended that a less
                    strict approach should be taken with regard to the imposition of
                    terms/conditions pursuant to the AA phrase as compared to the IAA
                phrase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Drawing from <em>The
                        Xanadu</em> and <em>The Duden</em>, the general
                    principles applicable for the imposition of terms/conditions pursuant to the AA
                    phrase (and also the IAA phrase) can be summarised as follows. First, the court
                    has an <em>unfettered discretion</em> to impose any
                    terms/conditions upon staying court proceedings in favour of arbitration.
                    Second, any terms/conditions imposed must be <em>reasonable</em> and <em>appropriate</em> in the
                    circumstances. Third, the discretionary power to impose terms/conditions must be
                    exercised <em>judiciously</em>, with the main guiding
                    principle being that the court should generally be <em>slow to
                        interfere in the arbitration process</em>. Fourth, the court should
                        <em>not be reluctant</em> to impose terms/conditions
                    where the justice of the case calls for it. It goes without saying that the
                    party arguing for the imposition of a term/condition bears the burden of
                    establishing that the desired term/condition should be imposed. In addition, the
                    Condition (or a term/condition to similar effect) should only be imposed in
                    special circumstances as it takes away a substantive right of one of the parties
                    (see the astute suggestion of the learned author of <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003
                    Reissue) in an endnote at para 20.044, which was adopted in <em>The Duden</em> at [16] (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court on a stay under s 6 of the Arbitration
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In my view, the circumstances and evidence
                    taken in totality clearly indicate that an unconditional stay should be ordered
                    pursuant to s 6 of the Arbitration Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Three observations ought to be highlighted in
                    particular. First, there is a significant degree of uncertainty as to whether
                    Jurong Port will suffer undue and disproportionate hardship. For one, Jurong
                    Port, on its own submissions, has at least one basis for its claim that will
                    probably remain unaffected by any limitation issues, <em>viz</em>, breach of warranty (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). In addition, Jurong Port could not confirm that
                    there will <em>likely</em> be limitation issues. Its
                    argument, as would be recalled, was merely that there are “<em>possible</em> issues of limitation” [emphasis added]
                    (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). For completeness, it
                    should be added that Mr Lim gave an explanation for the failure to pinpoint
                    probable limitation issues that can be described as being rather bare (having
                    regard to the fact that Jurong Port has had <em>several
                        years</em> since the first discovery of defects in the Cranes to
                    obtain the necessary information). He stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not totally clear when the limitation period would expire in this
                        case as [Drydocks] had delivered the [C]ranes to [Jurong Port] all the way
                        back in 2001 to 2004. Many of [Jurong Port’s] staff have left and the
                        nature of the defects in the [C]ranes were latent defects making it
                        extremely difficult to determine with any certainty when they manifested
                        themselves and when [Jurong Port] found out about them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, the evidence does not establish that there was any untoward
                    conduct on the part of Drydocks. Third, Jurong Port was fully cognisant of the
                    Clauses, and would or should have been aware of the steps that it had to take in
                    order to ensure that any reference of the dispute to arbitration would take
                    place within the relevant limitation periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In light of the above, there is no need for me
                    to consider Drydocks’ alternative grounds for a stay of
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For the foregoing reasons, I grant an
                    unconditional stay of the Action based on s 6 of the Arbitration Act. I
                    will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p>
