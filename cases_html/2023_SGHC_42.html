Furthermore, none of the facts raised by Mr Vangal were material as they did not impugn the validity of the HK Judgment and instead demonstrated exactly why OS 1054 was necessary.

In SUM 4456, Mr Vangal invited me to exercise my discretion under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) REFJA to grant a further adjournment of SUM 2662 and corresponding stay of ORC 5731, on account of the pending Second HK Stay Application. After I dismissed SUM 4456, Mr Vangal reiterated the grounds for setting aside previously raised before the learned Assistant Registrar in SUM 2662.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 First, Mr Vangal accepted that IOB’s technical non-compliance with O 67 r 3(4) ROC 2014 would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be fatal to an application to register a foreign judgment under REFJA. Instead, he submitted that IOB’s non-compliance should be regarded as evidence that IOB’s “desire to register was fleeting and perfunctory”. According to him, this meant that ORC 5731 should not have been granted and this therefore supported the application for adjournment in SUM 4456.

Mr Vangal essentially relied upon but recast the same facts that were held to be immaterial by the learned Assistant Registrar. He submitted that IOB did not simply fail to disclose its prior attempt to pursue bankruptcy proceedings by serving a statutory demand, but instead concealed this fact. Furthermore, contrary to IOB’s assertions of urgency, IOB had in fact been dilatory in seeking registration of the HK Judgment. Recast in this way, Mr Vangal suggested that IOB had acted oppressively and in bad faith or had at least been economical with the truth, factors which he submitted pointed in favour of granting the application for adjournment in SUM 4456.

Second, the court should consider any offer by the judgment debtor to provide security for the appeal, as a term of any adjournment sought. Third, the court should consider how readily the judgment debtor will be able to recover the judgment sums paid <span class="font-italic">if</span> the judgment is enforced and the appeal then subsequently allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In this case, Mr Vangal made no offer of security. On the other hand, he would in all likelihood have no difficulty in recovering any judgment sums paid in the event of a successful appeal because IOB is a bank with a presence in Hong Kong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Further, I was mindful that CACV 48/2018 had been outstanding for almost five years, and that Mr Vangal’s First HK Stay Application, pending the outcome of which I had originally allowed adjournment, had been dismissed. Mr Vangal’s Second HK Stay Application may not be heard for quite some time, and his counsel was unable to assure me of any time frame within which it would be dealt with (as above at [22]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In light of the above factors, I declined to exercise my discretion to adjourn the matter further.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Setting aside ORC 5731</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn now to the other grounds raised for setting aside ORC 5731. I should observe that I do so notwithstanding that the first and second of these grounds failed before the learned Assistant Registrar when he heard the matter on 31 May 2022, and I had not accepted them when I decided IOB’s appeal on 29 July 2022. Nonetheless, I considered their merits again, and rejected them. My reasons follow.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-compliance with O 67 r 3(4) ROC 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As ultimately accepted by counsel for Mr Vangal, the non-compliance with O 67 r 3(4) ROC 2014 was curable. Indeed, his own expert agreed that the HK Judgment was enforceable by execution. This was what the learned Assistant Registrar found in rejecting this objection. In these circumstances, I agreed that the objection must be rejected.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-disclosure of failed bankruptcy proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On this point, I agreed with the analysis of the learned Assistant Registrar, whose reasoning was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I was unable to agree with [Mr Vangal] that there was material non-disclosure which justified setting aside the registration. In short, [Mr Vangal] points to various alleged non-disclosures but none of them in my view amount to undisclosed material facts for the purposes of the ex-parte application for registration. Relying on para 87 of <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Vasily Golovnin”, </span>the thrust of [Mr Vangal’s] contention is that [IOB] should have disclosed facts relating to the previous unsuccessful attempt to enforce the Hong Kong Judgment by way of serving a statutory demand and to OSB 109/2019 where the statutory demand was set aside. But in my view, this “unsuccessful prior proceeding” is far removed from the situation in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Vasily Golovnin” </span>where in the context of a ship arrest hearing in Singapore, the applicant failed to disclose information pertaining to a contested ship arrest hearing in another jurisdiction which resulted in the ship actually being released from arrest. The crux there was that in considering the application for ship arrest in Singapore, the court’s attention should have been drawn to the fact that another court in another jurisdiction had already determined there was no right of arrest for the ship under the same or similar claims. Whether or not the “unsuccessful prior proceeding” was a material fact which warranted disclosure depends on the degree to which it dealt with substantially the same issue(s) before the court in the present proceedings. By comparison, the outcome in OSB 109 did not impugn upon the validity of the underlying Hong Kong Judgment nor was it the case that the court in OSB 109 had determined that the Hong Kong Judgment could not be registered. To the contrary, the court in OSB 109 had alluded to the point that registration of the Hong Kong Judgment was a necessary prior step. This was then the step that [IOB] eventually took via the registration application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Accordingly, I rejected this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, comity was raised. It was said that respect to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal required an adjournment pending disposal of CACV 48/2018 or at least of the Second HK Stay Application. In my view, however, given the dismissal of the First HK Stay Application, it may be said to the contrary that comity weighed in favour of registration. Even if the appeal succeeds, Mr Vangal will in all likelihood have no difficulty recovering any judgment sums paid (as noted above at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 For these reasons, I dismissed both SUM 4456 and SUM 2662.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Cong Yen, Lionel (Chen Congren) and Caleb Tan Jia Chween (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat and Phang Cunkuang (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the second respondent;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first and third respondents absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
