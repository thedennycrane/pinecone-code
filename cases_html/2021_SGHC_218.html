While it was possible that the rate of consumption was as he claimed, given his long addiction and use of diamorphine, it was not enough on the facts here to rebut the presumption and that possibility fell short of the required strength. The fact that he had two pieces or “batu”<span class="font-italic"> </span>of diamorphine also pointed against his version, the circumstances as how he described them were not plausible, and if indeed there was some choke point at Deepavali, one would not have expected this to last or go far beyond the point of delivery to him.

Where an accused relies on such a defence of his own consumption to rebut the presumption in s 17, the court considers the overall circumstances of the case, including (a) whether there is credible evidence concerning the accused’s rate of consumption and the number of days the supply is meant for; (b) the frequency of supply available to the accused; and (c) whether the accused had the financial means to purchase the drugs for himself: <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Abdullah v PP and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 427 at [29]–[31]; <span class="font-italic">PP v Tan Kay Yong and another </span>[2018] SGHC 67 at [92].

However, the burden lay on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not possess the two “batu” for trafficking. His explanation for how he came to be possessed of two “batu” lacked sufficient credibility to bring him over the threshold: it was for him to bring in sufficient evidence. The assertions about the effect of the Deepavali holiday and what his supplier told him were not sufficiently cogent or convincing. They seemed in fact rather flimsy for the reasons pointed out by the Prosecution: one would have expected in the normal run of things for any supply difficulties around a holiday to have been resolved after the holiday. This was a substantial discrepancy. The fact of the matter was, as the Prosecution pointed out, the accused was able to get more than usual after the holiday, obtaining two “batu”.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Paraphernalia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The presence of paraphernalia normally used in drug trafficking was yet another pointer against the Relevant Drugs being only for consumption.

</div> but these discrepancies were not of the scale to lead to a rejection of the accused’s evidence on this score. Some discrepancy or inconsistency is to be expected in the recounting of evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The accused’s financial position was sufficient, at least at the point of arrest, for him to sustain his claimed consumption. The amount of money he had would appear to be sufficient to support that habit at the rate he claimed.

</div>  It may be, as argued by the Prosecution, that that rate could not be sustained for a period of time, but beyond the point of arrest, any other inferences from the financial evidence would be speculative.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mental state</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There was some evidence given as to the mental state of the accused.  As the Defence did not take issue with the voluntariness of the statements given by the accused, the mental state was primarily relevant for the accused in explaining why he had given differing accounts of his rate of consumption. This has been dealt with above (at [32], [34] and [36]). I did not find that the purported distress, withdrawal symptoms or any depressive disorder were such as to affect his communication with the doctors or his giving of statements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overall assessment and conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The evidence as a whole pointed to the conclusion that the accused had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking. The lack of support from the financial transactions for that conclusion did not mean that the accused succeeded in rebutting that presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As the accused failed to rebut the presumption, he was guilty and accordingly he was in possession of the Relevant Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. He was thus convicted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The trafficking by the accused could not have been merely intended for moving the Relevant Drugs around, or transporting it from place to place or person to person. Given that his only defence was of personal consumption, and he did not put forward any other explanation for his possession of the Relevant Drugs, the only inference that could follow on the facts was that he was in possession for sale to others. This was buttressed by his possession of the zip lock bags and weighing scales. The fact that there was no evidence as to how much he charged or was paid, or that anyone in fact bought from him did not assist him in avoiding the conviction. Indeed, his version that he sold occasionally, to help his friends out, further underlined that the only alternative available on the facts was sale to others.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence imposed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The accused did not qualify for sentencing under the alternative regime prescribed under ss 33B(1) and (2) of the Act, which requires that his involvement was limited to transportation of some sort and that the Public Prosecutor has certified his substantive assistance in the disruption of drug trafficking. The conviction on the charge of trafficking after rejecting that it was consumption precluded any finding that the accused was only concerned with the transportation of drugs, informally termed a “courier”. The implication was that the Accused was in possession of the Relevant Drugs to sell, or that in any event, his activities were not only concerned with transportation of some sort. There was no evidence that he was merely in fact going to hand them over to someone else to deal with. The Relevant Drugs were either in his hands for consumption or for sale; as one is precluded the other must follow. In any event, no certificate of substantive assistance was granted by the Public Prosecutor under s 33B.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 With no alternative sentencing being available, the mandatory sentence of death under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the Act applied. No mitigation was made. As I had no discretion in the matter, I thus imposed the death penalty as required by the law.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Zu Zhao, Rimplejit Kaur and Teo Siu Ming (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Amolat Singh (Amolat &amp; Partners) and Lau Kah Hee (BC Lim &amp; Lau LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
