<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff and defendant (collectively,
                    “the couple”) were divorced in 2007. At the ancillary stage, the
                    plaintiff made a claim for, <em>inter alia</em>, a share of
                    the net proceeds from the sale of a property known as 16A Jervois Lane, #01-05,
                    Clydesville, Singapore 159192 (“the Property”). She alleged that
                    the Property had been the matrimonial home of the couple, and as such, she was
                    entitled to a share of the net sale proceeds. On 22 August 2008, the
                    defendant’s aunt (“the intervener”) succeeded in her
                    application to be joined as a party to the suit. The intervener prosecuted a
                    claim for all the net proceeds on the basis that the Property had been bought
                    with a loan extended by her to the couple.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The couple were married on 7 January 1991.
                    Their first child was born in 1993. Their second child was born in 1995. Up
                    until 1995, the couple had been living in rented premises. In that year, they
                    purchased the Property for $1,944,639.82 (inclusive of stamp and legal fees).
                    They moved into the Property and lived there with their two children until 2005,
                    when their relationship broke down, causing them to establish separate
                    households. After the Property was vacated by the family, it was rented out, and
                    eventually sold on 17 May 2007 for a net sum of
                $1,561,911.06.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The facts given above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> are undisputed. However, two vastly different accounts were
                    presented regarding the circumstances in which the plaintiff and defendant came
                    to purchase the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the plaintiff, in 1995, she and the
                    defendant had been viewing properties in Singapore within a price range of
                    $500,000 to $750,000. Their second child was almost due and they wanted to move
                    out of the Orchard Road area where they were staying at that point of time. On
                    9 July 1995, the couple had lunch with the intervener and her husband, the
                    defendant’s uncle, during which an invitation was extended to view the
                    Property. The couple agreed to accompany their uncle and aunt not suspecting
                    anything out of the ordinary, as the older couple were very active in the
                    property market and frequently bought properties and rented them
                out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After viewing the Property, the couple were
                    informed that the intervener and her husband were in the process of purchasing
                    the Property for them. The intervener and her husband had only asked the couple
                    to view the Property in order to confirm that the Property was to their liking.
                    They told the couple that as 1 per cent of the purchase price as an option fee
                    had already been paid, the couple only had a few days to decide if they wanted
                    to accept the gift of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The next day, on 10 July 1995, the couple
                    signed the acceptance form attached to the option to purchase. The option was
                    exercised on 14 July 1995. The intervener and her husband handled all
                    aspects of the conveyance thereafter, even though all the transfer documents
                    were completed in favour of the couple. The entire purchase price of the
                    Property was paid for by the intervener and her husband. They also paid the
                    legal fees, and all the maintenance fees, property tax and incidental expenses
                    associated with the Property prior to the completion of the conveyance. Their
                    control over the conveyance even extended to making arrangements to vary the
                    completion date of the conveyance without the knowledge of the couple. The
                    couple had no contact with the solicitors handling the conveyance until they
                    found out about the deferment of the completion date and had to issue
                    instructions to revert to the original date, following a discussion with the
                    vendors. On 22 September 1995, the intervener and her husband formally
                    presented the couple with the Property as a gift. All necessary documentation,
                    records, and keys were also handed over on that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the plaintiff, she and the
                    defendant were aware that other family members who had received generous gifts
                    from the intervener and her husband were gossiped about amongst their relatives
                    in Singapore. They were also concerned that the defendant’s father would
                    lose face by their acceptance of such a generous gift from the
                    intervener’s husband, who was his brother. The couple therefore decided to
                    take financial responsibility for at least some of the value of the gifted
                    property, in a bid to maintain a good relationship with the defendant’s
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The couple had a discussion with the intervener
                    and her husband. They decided to make voluntary “honour payments”
                    approximating the downpayment on the Property, on the suggestion of the
                    intervener and her husband. Therefore, between 24 July 1995 and
                    29 January 2001, the couple made payments amounting to $331,387.47. A
                    cheque for $1,387.47 went towards maintenance fees and property taxes payable on
                    the Property. The balance of the sum of $331,387.47 was paid towards the
                    downpayment of $376,000. The amount and timing of all the “honour
                    payments” were at the discretion of the couple.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Initially, cheques were issued in favour of the
                    intervener’s husband. However, from December 1995 onwards, payments were
                    made to the intervener. This was because the intervener’s husband directed
                    that payment should be made to the intervener instead of to himself. Therefore,
                    the couple issued cheques to the intervener even though the gift was known to
                    stem from the intervener’s husband, and not the intervener
                herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Throughout the six years during which the
                    couple made “honour payments”, the intervener’s husband
                    reminded them that it was not necessary to reimburse him up to the sum of the
                    downpayment for the property. He often commented that what the couple had paid
                    was more than sufficient and they should stop making payments. Of their own
                    volition, however, they continued to make payments as they were short of their
                    own personal target figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Although the last cheque cashed by the
                    intervener was on 29 January 2001, the couple had issued another cheque for
                    $10,000 to her in March 2001. When asked, the intervener and her husband told
                    the couple that they would not be cashing the cheque drawn in March 2001. When
                    the couple visited the intervener and her husband, they were told that they had
                    “over-proven” that they were honourable and proud people. The
                    intervener and her husband wanted them to from then on simply accept the gift
                    graciously, as it had been originally intended. The intervener’s husband
                    indicated that he had more money than he knew what to do with and wanted to
                    share it with those that he cared for while he was still alive and not getting
                    any younger. The intervener’s husband even pleaded with the couple to just
                    be gracious and accept the property without any strings attached. After
                    discussion, the couple agreed. It was a result of this acceptance that no
                    further honour payments were made and the March 2001 cheque was subsequently
                    destroyed by the intervener and her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Property was placed on the open market for
                    sale on 16 January 2007. On 8 February 2007, the couple granted an
                    option on the Property to a third party. That option was exercised on the same
                    day. The plaintiff maintained that throughout the whole process, the defendant
                    had been discussing the sale with the intervener’s husband. However, the
                    intervener and her husband never raised the issue of the repayment of the
                    purported loan. The first time that the plaintiff heard about the loan was on
                    21 May 2007, shortly after an attempted mediation between her and the
                    defendant had failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The intervener’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The intervener’s evidence, as
                    corroborated by her husband and the defendant, was that no such gift had
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to the intervener, she was aware
                    that the couple had been staying in rented premises throughout their marriage.
                    Each time the couple renewed their lease, or rented new premises, the rent would
                    increase. The intervener therefore took it upon herself to suggest that she
                    would loan them money in order that they could buy an apartment. She told them
                    that they could repay her in interest-free instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In 1995, the intervener was looking for real
                    estate to invest in when she came across the Property. She asked the couple to
                    view the Property with her. She had the intention of helping them to purchase
                    the Property if they liked it. She had also determined that in the event that
                    the couple did not like the Property, she would purchase it for herself as she
                    had already paid the 1 per cent booking fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the couple liked the Property, she told
                    them that she would instruct her solicitors to exercise the option under their
                    names. She loaned them the sum of $1,944,649.82 to purchase the Property. These
                    moneys, which were paid out of the intervener and her husband’s joint
                    account, were forwarded directly to the solicitors to pay for the purchase of
                    the Property. The intervener’s husband was aware of the agreement to loan
                    to the money to the couple, but he was not part of the transaction. The money
                    transferred to the solicitors for the purchase of the Property had been banked
                    into the joint account by the intervener to pay for the transaction. The
                    intervener’s husband never made any representations regarding the
                    necessity of reimbursing himself or the intervener for the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The intervener denied that she and her husband
                    were fond of making generous gifts to their relatives. The only gifts admitted
                    to were the gift of a car to the ex-chairman of their company to reward him for
                    his loyalty and good service, the gift of a car to her niece so that she could
                    take her grandmother on outings, and the gift of a Singapore Island Country Club
                    membership to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The intervener was very fond of the defendant
                    because she had brought him up from a very young age when his mother passed
                    away. Nonetheless, she maintained that she had no intention that the moneys
                    should be treated as a gift. It was due to the fact that the intervener treated
                    the defendant as family, that she told him that he could repay her as and when
                    he had the funds. It was also for this reason that the intervener dispensed with
                    the need for formal documentation. However, the intervener and the defendant
                    agreed that if the Property were sold before the couple had completed repaying
                    her, the sale proceeds would first be used to repay the outstanding amount of
                    the loan. If there were any profits after that, the couple could keep them.
                    There was no discussion of making “honour payments”. Neither was
                    there a formal presentation of the Property as a gift to the
                couple.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Consequent to the arrangements made, the
                    couple made a first payment of $25,000 to the intervener on 24 July 1995.
                    Thereafter, they paid various amounts on various dates between 1995 and 2001.
                    The payments amounted to a total sum of $329,387.47.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     About late 2000 or early 2001, the intervener
                    noticed that the couple had difficulty repaying her. After speaking to the
                    defendant, she agreed to a moratorium of the payments. A 5-year period was
                    mentioned in passing as the defendant conveyed that it would take him at least
                    that long to regain his financial footing. Nonetheless, when the couple were
                    able to afford it, the payments were to start again. The intervener agreed to
                    the moratorium because she did not want the defendant to feel stressed or
                    pressured over having to continue making payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In early 2007, the defendant informed the
                    intervener that the plaintiff had commenced divorce proceedings against him and
                    was claiming 75 per cent of the Property. The intervener was concerned that the
                    balance moneys owed to her would not be repaid. She therefore instructed her
                    solicitors to write to the couple to remind them of her interest in the
                    Property. Subsequently, the plaintiff informed her that the plaintiff regarded
                    the moneys as a gift and not a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The sole issue to be decided was whether the
                    intervener gifted the plaintiff and the defendant with the moneys used for the
                    purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I held that the moneys provided by the
                    intervener were not meant as a gift but as a loan to the plaintiff and
                    defendant. I set out my reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     A gift is a gratuitous transfer of the
                    ownership of property. The donor has to display a clear intention to transfer
                    his interest in the object that is being given (see Michael Bridge, <em>Personal Property Law</em>, 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    ed., (Oxford, 2006) at 96). As held in <em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v
                        Tianzon Lolita</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 at [11]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a gift is made, the donor normally has no intention to claim any
                        interest or share in it and his intention is that the recipient should take
                        the gift absolutely – that must be his intention, at any rate, at the
                        time of the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts, I was satisfied that there was no such intention.
                    Rather, the intervener transferred the money used to pay for the Property on the
                    understanding that it would be repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Schedule of payments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     While there was no written agreement
                    evidencing the loan, the intervener had kept a schedule of payment listing
                    details such as the amounts paid, the date of payment, the cheque number and the
                    balance payment due. I accepted the intervener’s evidence that the moneys
                    used to purchase the Property were provided by her alone and that the schedule
                    was kept concurrently with the payments made by the couple. The existence of the
                    schedule indicated that the intervener intended and expected that the moneys
                    used to purchase the Property would be repaid. Furthermore, the entries in the
                    schedule indicated fairly regular payment on the part of the couple. The only
                    extended break in the payments made was from 2001 onwards, when the intervener
                    granted a debt moratorium, out of her concern for the defendant, her nephew, who
                    in her view, was facing some financial difficulties at that time. Evidence was
                    given by an employee of the intervener, one Ms Lim Suay Moi, that it was
                    her responsibility to keep the schedule and that she had updated the entries in
                    her own handwriting as and when payments were made. She denied the allegation of
                    the plaintiff that the evidence regarding the contemporaneous updating of the
                    schedule was given on the instructions of the intervener or her husband. I saw
                    no reason to doubt the veracity of Ms Lim’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It ought to be noted that the plaintiff had
                    also kept a schedule of the payments made. In fact, the schedule was titled
                        “<em>Capital Payments</em> to Uncle Eu Seng
                    &amp; Auntie Eva” [emphasis added]. The plaintiff is an accountant and,
                    as such, must understand the meaning of “capital payments”. These
                    facts strongly suggested that there was no confusion in the plaintiff’s
                    mind that the moneys extended were a loan and not a gift. The moneys paid by the
                    couple were not “honour payments” as the plaintiff had alleged.
                    The couple was well aware that the Property was bought with the proceeds of a
                    loan and not a gift. Whilst the plaintiff had alleged that it was the
                    couple’s intention to repay the “downpayment” which she
                    specified was the sum of $376,000, it is significant that at the time of
                    purchase there had not been a downpayment in that amount. The intervener had
                    paid first a one percent option fee, then nine percent on acceptance (total
                    $188,000) and then, on completion, the remaining 90% of the price. Further, the
                    plaintiff’s schedule makes no mention of the agreed downpayment. It only
                    records the payments made and does not mention the balance due.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Gifts to other persons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff submitted that the gift of the
                    Property was in keeping with other similar gifts of substantial value that the
                    intervener and her husband had made to relatives. In particular, the plaintiff
                    alleged that the intervener and her husband had given the defendant’s
                    brother an apartment in Hong Kong. I rejected her submissions on this point.
                    First, the defendant’s brother had filed an affidavit denying that the
                    property in question was gifted to him by either the intervener or her husband.
                    The plaintiff had not adduced any evidence to prove that the property in Hong
                    Kong, or any other real property held by any other person for that matter, had
                    been a gift from the intervener or her husband. Second, the only gifts given by
                    the intervener or her husband that were proven on the evidence were (a) a Lexus
                    car to reward the ex-chairman of a company for loyalty and good service, (b)
                    another car to a niece, and (c) a Singapore Island Country Club membership to
                    the defendant. These gifts were, comparatively, much smaller in value than the
                    Property and did not support the conclusion that the intervener or her husband
                    had been in the habit of making gifts of such substantial value that the gift of
                    the Property would not be out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Probative value of affidavits filed by persons other than the
                plaintiff, the defendant, the intervener and her husband</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff relied on the evidence in
                    affidavits filed by persons such as:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Maria Buttler, the close personal friend of the
                            plaintiff and the defendant;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Robert J Dorey and Jeanne M Dorey, the
                            plaintiff’s parents;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Robert M Dorey, the plaintiff’s
                            brother;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Debra Dorey and Christina Gray, the
                            plaintiff’s sisters; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Ventser, godfather to the
                            plaintiff’s and defendant’s child.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">In each of these affidavits, it was asserted that the moneys used to
                    purchase the Property had been a gift. However, these affidavits were filed by
                    persons who had no firsthand knowledge of the circumstances in which the
                    intervener provided moneys for the purchase of the Property. As such, I regarded
                    the evidence given in such affidavits to be of little probative
                value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Renovations and credit lines</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff made much of the fact that when
                    she and the defendant had entered into loan agreements with third party
                    financial institutions using the Property as security collateral for the loans,
                    they did not declare the existence of a loan by the intervener during the
                    application process. She reasoned that if there had been a loan by the
                    intervener, it surely would have been disclosed then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the evidence given, the loan given by the
                    intervener was interest free, and payable as and when the couple were able. The
                    couple could dispose of the Property in any manner they liked. The only
                    restriction was that if the Property were to be sold, the couple would use the
                    proceeds to repay the intervener for the part of the loan that remained as yet
                    unpaid, and only thereafter would they pocket the surplus. There was no
                    requirement that other creditors who took the Property as security had to be
                    informed of the loan given by the intervener. In the light of these
                    circumstances, that the couple had not disclosed the loan in the application
                    process for the loans they took in 1996 and 2002 respectively was not fatal to
                    finding that the moneys used to purchase the Property had been provided on the
                    basis of a loan. In fact, their lack of disclosure was understandable since such
                    disclosure might have prevented them from having their loan applications
                    approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The couple’s house-hunting budget</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff argued that as the purchase
                    price of the Property far exceeded the couple’s original house-hunting
                    budget of $500,000 to $750,000, they could not have accepted the Property on the
                    basis of anything other than a gift. I did not find that point to be persuasive.
                    The loan was being extended on very favourable terms to the couple. It was
                    interest free and payable as and when the couple were able. It is not
                    inconceivable that given these terms, the couple would find the Property to be
                    within their means even if the purchase price was beyond their original
                    budget.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Negotiations relating to the division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff also argued that the lack of
                    mention of the loan during negotiations between herself and the defendant
                    relating to the division of matrimonial assets supported the conclusion that the
                    moneys extended by the intervener were a gift. In my view, whether or not the
                    couple expressly mentioned the loan during negotiations concerning the division
                    of matrimonial assets is not material because whether or not the loan was
                    mentioned, it would have been understood that any division of the sale proceeds
                    of the Property could only take place after the debt towards the intervener had
                    been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of objection to the sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff submitted that if there were
                    indeed a loan, and the intervener had an interest in the sale of the Property,
                    she would have lodged a caveat to protect her interest. That the intervener did
                    not object to the sale was, according to the plaintiff, evidence supporting the
                    case that there had indeed been no loan. The plaintiff also alleged that it was
                    more than coincidence that the intervener only made her application after a
                    mediation session between the plaintiff and the defendant had failed. What was
                    implied was that the intervener’s application had been taken out for
                    strategic or punitive purposes in support of and for the benefit of the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, given that the plaintiff had not
                    adduced credible evidence to show that the intervener was aware that the
                    Property was to be sold, I accepted the intervener’s explanation that she
                    had not objected to the sale of the Property because she was not aware that the
                    Property had been placed on the open market. The plaintiff suggested that the
                    intervener ought to have been aware of the sale on the basis that the intervener
                    and her husband sold the unit they owned in the same development within the same
                    week that the couple sold their apartment. Neither the intervener nor her
                    husband, however, was the owner of the unit. It had merely been purchased by a
                    holding company in which the intervener had shares. I found it unlikely that the
                    intervener would have known of the sale of the Property just because a holding
                    company in which she had shares had sold an apartment in the same development in
                    the same week. It was also not proven that discussions had taken place between
                    the defendant and the intervener or her husband where the sale of the Property
                    had been mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Timing of the intervener’s application to be joined as a
                party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff alleged that the
                    intervener’s application was motivated by a failed mediation session
                    between the couple concerning the relocation of the plaintiff and her two
                    children to Australia. I found that there was no support for the proposition
                    that the intervener’s application to be joined as a party was motivated by
                    anything other than the desire to recover the loan she had given. There was no
                    evidence to show that the intervener intended to strategically recover the net
                    proceeds of the Property only to transfer them to the defendant in circumvention
                    of the process of the division of matrimonial assets. Neither was there evidence
                    that the intervener’s action had been brought to put pressure on the
                    plaintiff regarding ancillary matters to the divorce suit. In fact, although as
                    evidence that there was no loan, the plaintiff pointed to the defendant’s
                    letter, which asked the intervener to waive half the amount of the loan, the
                    intervener’s decision to nonetheless bring a claim for the entire net
                    proceeds of the sale of the Property buttressed the finding that the
                    intervener’s claim was not motivated by a desire to assist the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the foregoing reasons, I found that the
                    money for the purchase of the Property was provided by the intervener as a loan
                    to the plaintiff and defendant and held that the net proceeds of the sale of the
                    Property had to be released to her. Costs were fixed at $8,000 plus reasonable
                    disbursements, to be paid by the plaintiff to the intervener.</p>
