Her evidence was clear, consistent and unequivocal as to whom her molester was (the GD at [24]–[27]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The victim’s account of the incident was “credible, consistent and unequivocal”. Her evidence was unusually convincing (the GD at [32]–[34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The evidence of the appellant’s medical condition was “really neither here nor there”. The evidence did not totally exclude the possibility that the appellant could have committed the offence in the manner described by the victim (the GD at [28]–[31]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The appellant’s evidence was unconvincing, self-serving and contradictory (the GD at [35]–[39]). The appellant’s credit was impeached pursuant to the Prosecution’s application to impeach his credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”) with reference to his statement recorded on 5 July 2013 pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) (“the 5 July 2013 statement”). The appellant’s attempts to explain the material discrepancies between his account in court and his 5 July 2013 statement were “totally inadequate” (the GD at [40]–[42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The District Judge sentenced the appellant to eight months’ imprisonment for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While an imprisonment sentence is appropriate because the appellant touched the victim’s groin area for a prolonged period, the sentencing benchmark of nine months’ imprisonment with caning laid down by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chow Yee Sze </span>[2011] 1 SLR 481 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow Yee </span><span class="font-italic">Sze</span>”) is not applicable because the appellant did not touch the victim’s private parts <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. The appropriate starting point is thus in the range of five to six months’ imprisonment (the GD at [51]–[53] and [62]–[63]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An uplift on the identified starting point was necessary because the following aggravating factors were present: (i) the incident took place on a public transport vehicle; (ii) the victim was only 14 years old at the time of the offence; and (iii) the victim suffered from emotional and psychological trauma as a result of the incident (the GD at [55]–[59]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ultimately, the appropriate sentence should be eight months’ imprisonment because: (i) although the appellant, being above the age of 50, was not eligible for caning, an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning was not necessary because the present offence was not one for which caning was an appropriate sentence in the first place (the GD at [60]); and (ii) the appellant was a first-time offender who volunteered actively (the GD at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In respect of the appeal against conviction, the issues that arise for my determination are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the victim correctly identified the appellant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the victim’s evidence was “unusually convincing”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As for the appeal against sentence, given that the appellant’s appeal against sentence is only brought on the basis that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive,

In considering the circumstances in which the identification was made, the judge should take note of any specific weaknesses in the identification evidence.

</div> Also, it was the victim’s evidence in her First Information Report (“P1”) that the appellant was wearing an “orange striped polo-t”. Leaving aside for the moment whether the appellant was indeed wearing a polo T-shirt (which I will address below at [21(b)]), the appellant himself agreed that orange is a distinctive colour that people usually do not wear.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, while the victim might indeed ordinarily not remember her fellow passengers on a public bus, the fact that she had been molested would have incited her to take a good look at the appellant and commit his face to memory. This is evident from Yong Pung How CJ’s previous observation that a victim of molest would have good reason to remember the molester because it would be “precisely the fact that she had been molested which would have caused [her] to take a really good look at her molester and commit his face to memory”: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v L (a minor) </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1041 at [28], cited with affirmation in <span class="font-italic">Ye Wei Gen v Public Prosecutor </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 1074 at [19]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Thirdly, the victim was able to accurately identify the appellant to PW3 on each of the next three days after the incident, and also to the police when the appellant was being arrested by PW4 and PW5 on the third day after the incident. The victim was also subsequently able to correctly identify the appellant from a photograph line-up comprising of nine Indian men. In my view, the fact that all these were achieved without the assistance of any photographs or CCTV footage showed the conviction that the victim had in her identification of the appellant. The fact that the victim’s subsequent identification of the appellant to the police took place just three days after her original observation of the appellant also enhanced the probative value of her identification evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Finally, while there were indeed discrepancies between the victim’s description of the appellant in P1 and the actual appearance of the appellant, I do not think that these discrepancies are material enough to diminish the probative value of the victim’s identification evidence. In P1, the victim states that the appellant is a “Male Indian … in his 30s, plump built, height about 1.7m tall and wearing a[n] orange striped polo-t and a pair of black pants”.

I accept the victim’s evidence that the height recorded in P1 was different from the appellant’s actual height because the victim was merely relying on the police officer’s prompts in agreeing that the appellant was approximately of the police officer’s height. I also accept the Prosecution’s submission that the victim was not able to furnish the police with an accurate description of the appellant’s height and age when P1 was being recorded because of her lack of proficiency in estimating a person’s height and age, which in turn is entirely reasonable given that she was only 14 years old at the time of the incident.

</div> What is critical is that at the end of the day, although the victim was unable to give an accurate verbal description of the appellant, she was able to identify the appellant on multiple occasions after the incident.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second discrepancy is that whereas the victim had described that the appellant was wearing an orange striped polo shirt, the appellant claimed that he did not own an orange polo shirt, and would usually wear white, blue or chocolate-coloured shirts. In the first place, I do not think that the distinction between a <span class="font-italic">polo shirt</span> and a <span class="font-italic">shirt</span> is a material one in this context.

In my view, contrary to the appellant’s suggestion that the victim was making up her evidence at trial, it is perfectly reasonable for the victim not to have known how to describe the appellant’s top at the time of the incident given her age at the material time. Indeed, the fact that counsel for the appellant was himself similarly imprecise in his various references to a polo shirt, a shirt, and a T-shirt at trial serves to bring home this point.

</div> Turning then to address the <span class="font-italic">colour</span> of the appellant’s shirt, I also do not think that the appellant’s claim that he did not own an orange-coloured shirt is detrimental to the victim’s identification evidence. While it is true that the police should ideally have searched the appellant’s house and seized the orange striped shirt that was mentioned by the victim in P1, this only goes towards the lack of supporting evidence. The appellant’s bare assertion that he did not own an orange-coloured shirt is insufficient to show that the victim’s evidence that the appellant was wearing one on the day in question is necessarily untrue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As for the third question, even assuming that the victim’s identification evidence is not of a sufficiently good quality, there is supporting evidence that corroborates the victim’s identification of the appellant as the culprit. At trial, Mr Dennis Siah Keng Siong, an executive from SBS, testified that SBS’s bus records showed that the appellant and victim boarded the exact same bus at the exact same bus stop on 2 July 2013.

</div> In other words, it is incontrovertible that the appellant and victim were on the same bus no 17 at the time of the incident. Further, given that it was the evidence of neither the appellant nor the victim that either of them had moved up to the second deck of the bus during their respective commutes, this places the appellant at the same deck as the victim in the same bus. This makes the victim’s misidentification of the appellant an unlikely proposition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Taking into account the entirety of the identification evidence, I find that the victim’s identification evidence is of good quality. Moreover, it is also backed up by independent supporting evidence. Hence, I am convinced that the victim did indeed correctly identify the appellant as the culprit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the victim’s testimony was “unusually convincing” </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In my view, the victim’s evidence was “unusually convincing”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 When a conviction is based solely on the bare words of the complainant and nothing else, the complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt on its own, only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration. In other words, if the evidence of the complainant is not unusually convincing, the conviction on the sole basis of the complainant’s testimony would be unsafe unless there is further corroborative evidence. See <span class="font-italic">Pra</span><span class="font-italic">m Nair </span>([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [57] and <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [27] and [30]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 A complainant’s testimony would be considered “unusually convincing” only if the testimony, “when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”. A trial judge evaluates whether this standard is met by weighing the demeanour of the complainant alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the complainant’s testimony. See <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [28] citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [39].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Further, it is necessary for a court to assess <span class="font-italic">all </span>the relevant evidence when determining whether the Prosecution’s case is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, a court, when considering whether the complainant’s evidence is “unusually convincing”, must “assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused”, such that the complainant is found to be “unusually convincing” to the extent that “the court can safely say his account is to be unreservedly preferred over that of another”: <span class="font-italic">XP v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] SGHC 107 at [34] <span class="font-italic">per </span>V K Rajah JA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Synthesising the foregoing principles for the purposes of my analysis in the present appeal, I gather that when an appellate court is tasked with determining whether the complainant’s testimony is “unusually convincing”, the court has to evaluate: (a) the internal and external consistency of the complainant’s testimony (but not the demeanour of the complainant); and (b) the appellant’s evidence. It is only if the complainant’s evidence is not “unusually convincing” that further corroborative evidence would be needed to sustain the conviction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evaluation of the victim’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Having scrutinised the evidence of the victim, I find that the victim’s evidence was both internally and externally consistent. In this regard, I agree with the District Judge’s finding that the victim’s account of the incident was “credible, consistent, and unequivocal” enough to be considered “unusually convincing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 First, the victim’s account was internally consistent. On the whole, this was evident because the victim gave a measured and systematic account of the entire incident, clearly recounting where she and the appellant were standing at the time of the offence and how the appellant had touched her groin area. In my view, her vivid description of the manner in which the appellant had touched her groin area made it clear that the appellant had touched her intentionally (and not accidentally, as he had alleged). Additionally, the credibility of the victim’s account was enhanced by the lack of embellishment of her evidence in court. For example, she was candid in admitting under cross-examination that she does not keenly observe the people around her when she is commuting on the bus. Indeed, I would have found it dubious if the victim did not make this concession, given that most individuals probably do not keep a close watch of their fellow passengers during their daily commutes in the absence of anything unusual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Also, the victim was able to provide logical and rational explanations for the case theories that the appellant had sought to advance in his own defence at trial. For example, in response to the appellant’s suggestion that she could not have seen the appellant at all because she did not usually observe who was around her while on the bus, the victim explained that she was able to identify the appellant as the culprit in this case given that she specifically recalled seeing the appellant walking down the corridor of the first deck of the bus towards the staircase, where she was. Next, in response to the appellant’s suggestion that it was suspicious for her not to alert any of the other passengers around her when she was allegedly molested, the victim explained that she did not alert anyone else on the bus about what just happened only because she was too shocked and frightened, and also thought that no one would believe her.

</div>
</div> I find these to be perfectly reasonable justifications in response to the doubts that the appellant had attempted to sow in the victim’s testimony.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For the above reasons, I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the substantive core of the victim’s evidence remained unshaken, and her credibility remained unblemished, even after the victim had been subjected to the rigours of cross-examination. Therefore, I find that the victim’s evidence was internally consistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, the victim’s account was externally consistent. First, regarding her subsequent identification of the appellant on multiple occasions on the days immediately following the incident, her evidence is consistent with that of her father, PW3. In this regard, PW3’s evidence is consistent with the victim’s evidence specifically regarding the days on which the victim saw the appellant at the same bus stop, the colour of the appellant’s shirt that the victim claimed that she saw the appellant wear, the fact that PW3 is “physically big”, and how PW3 had arranged with the police for the ambush of the appellant on 5 July 2013. Second, the victim’s oral testimony regarding the entire incident is also consistent with her statement given when she made the police report in the evening of the day on which the incident occurred, P1. P1 provides the following description of the incident by the victim:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It was a double deck bus and it was crowded when I boarded the bus. I was standing on the lower deck, on the left side of the stairs, facing the alighting door. When I was at the next bus stop, there were many other commuters waiting to board the bus. As such, the passengers on board were moving in. There was this Male Indian who moved in and stood infront [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] of me. He was standing side ways, with his left side facing me. Out of a sudden, I felt a hand touching my private part area. I looked down and saw that the said man’s hand was touching my private part area. I tried to use my left hand to push his hand away. But to no avail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As is apparent from the foregoing discussion of the victim’s account of the events at trial, the account provided by the victim in P1 remained broadly consistent throughout the victim’s entire oral testimony at trial.

I take the view that the appellant’s credit was rightly impeached at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The material portions of the 5 July 2013 statement, where the appellant described the incident, are reproduced as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 … The bus 17 came and I boarded the bus. There were a lot of people boarding the same bus. I was in the middle group to board the bus. I used my EZ-link card … to board the bus. The bus was very crowded.

From Monday to Thursday of this week, I remembered I have been standing around the area.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 The bus I took was more with school children. The children are from St Anthony School. Usually during school day, the bus is crowded until the bus stop near St Anthony School.

However, at para 5 of the 5 July 2013 statement, the appellant stated that he could recall a single occasion when he had accidentally touched a girl with the back of his left palm. When confronted with this inconsistency at trial, the appellant explained that what he actually meant was that when he was giving his statement, he merely thought that he <span class="font-italic">might</span> have accidentally touched someone and not known about it due to the numbness that he suffers in his hand.

</div> I thus do not accept his explanation that what he had meant to convey in the 5 July 2013 statement was that he <span class="font-italic">might</span> have accidentally touched a girl.

While it is true that the charge had not yet been read to the appellant at that stage, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that the appellant had already known that he was facing a potentially serious charge regarding an allegation made by the victim that he had outraged her modesty by touching her groin area. Hence, the onus ought to have been on the appellant to share all relevant and pertinent information with the police in his defence, including the material fact that he could not have touched the victim as he was holding onto the railing of the bus with his right hand and his wallet with his left.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, the District Judge rightly found that the appellant’s credit was impeached at trial pursuant to s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At this juncture, it would be appropriate for me to clarify that insofar as the District Judge relied on the contents of the 5 July 2013 statement to establish that the appellant had in fact admitted to having “accidentally touched a girl with the back of his left pal[m]”, and that he could “<span class="font-italic">remember </span><span class="font-italic">this girl pushing [his] hand away</span>” [emphasis in original] (see the GD at [35]), this is impermissible. At trial, the 5 July 2013 statement was never admitted into evidence. The Prosecution had elected not to admit the 5 July 2013 statement under s 147(3) of the EA as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by the appellant would otherwise be admissible; instead, the Prosecution only elected to rely on the 5 July 2013 statement under s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA as proof of a former statement inconsistent with portions of the appellant’s oral evidence, in order to impeach the appellant’s credit.

However, recent developments in the local jurisprudence regarding sentencing for sexual offences necessitate the revisiting of this approach to sentencing for s 354(1) offences. It is thus to this specific endeavour that I now direct my mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">GBR </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGHC 296 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR</span>”), See Kee Oon J laid down the following sentencing framework regarding offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code for aggravated outrage of modesty committed against a child under 14 years of age:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  The court should first consider the following offence-specific factors (at [27]–[30]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The degree of sexual exploitation. This includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The circumstances of the offence. These include considerations of: (A) the presence of premeditation; (B) the use of force or violence; (C) the abuse of a position of trust; (D) the use of deception; (E) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (F) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Based on the consideration of the foregoing offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment (at [31]–[38]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-underline">Band 1</span>: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Less than one year’s imprisonment should be imposed, and caning is generally not imposed, although this depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) <span class="font-underline">Band 2</span>: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-on-skin contact.  The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-on-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception. One to three years’ imprisonment, and at least three strokes of the cane, should be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) <span class="font-underline">Band 3</span>: This includes cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim. Three to five years’ imprisonment, and at least six strokes of the cane, should be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court should also consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that relate to the offender generally but which are not offence-specific (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, offender-specific factors). Aggravating factors include the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, and relevant antecedents demonstrating recalcitrance. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused that relates to the offence (at [39]). The court should also consider whether there are grounds to enhance the sentence by way of the imposition of imprisonment in lieu of caning if the accused is certified to be unfit for caning because he is above 50 years of age at the time of caning (s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC), or is certified to be medically unfit for caning (s 331 of the CPC) (at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Indeed, I note that this very framework was in fact adopted from the “two-step sentencing bands” approach laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”) in the context of conducting a fundamental review of the sentencing framework for rape. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal, following a compendious analysis of the various types of guideline judgments that may be employed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “single starting point” approach, the “multiple starting points” approach”, the “benchmark” approach, and the “sentencing matrix” approach), preferred the methodology espoused by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Taueki </span>[2005] 3 NZLR 372 (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [26]–[38]). The “two-step sentencing bands” approach set out by the Court of Appeal may be summarised thus (at [39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the <span class="font-italic">offence</span> was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim (we shall refer to these as “offence-specific” factors). Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually</span> be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features, has been identified the court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the <span class="font-italic">offending act</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which <span class="font-italic">are personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These “offender-specific” factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorisation of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, the “two-step sentencing bands” approach, as set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>([46] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) for the purposes of sentencing for rape, and suitably modified by See J in <span class="font-italic">GBR </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) for the purposes of sentencing for aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code<span class="font-italic"> </span>has much to commend it. It is a reliable methodology to adopt in the context of sentencing sexual offences because it improves clarity, transparency, coherence and consistency in sentencing such offences. The court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>elaborates in this regard as follows (at [37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, it allows the court to clearly articulate the seriousness of the offence while allowing the sentence to be tailored according to the circumstances of each case. This promotes the communicative function of the criminal law, as it allows the court to express disapprobation for the <span class="font-italic">act</span> even if there are exceptional personal mitigating circumstances which might warrant a significant sentencing discount for the <span class="font-italic">offender</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, it promotes transparency and consistency in reasoning. Courts will have to openly and clearly articulate the precise weight that is being ascribed to a particular factor. This is especially important when an adjustment is made to account for the personal circumstances of the offender, where the dangers of inconsistency and arbitrariness are greater. If applied consistently over a period of time, the accumulation of transparently reasoned precedents will undoubtedly help future courts to accurately benchmark the seriousness of an offence against others of like nature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, it will promote greater coherence. The dichotomy between <span class="font-italic">offence</span>-related factors and <span class="font-italic">offender</span>-specific factors is conceptually sound (see, generally, Jessica Jacobson and Mike Hough, <span class="font-italic">Mitigation: The Role of Personal Factors in Sentencing </span>(Prison Reform Trust, 2007) at p <span class="font-italic">vii</span>) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, we consider that the approach of having several sentencing “bands” which are defined in general terms has significant advantages … . Chiefly, these advantages are (i) it will cover the entire range of offending acts instead of several select pockets of offending; and (ii) the use of sentencing ranges rather than fixed starting points will afford courts with greater flexibility to arrive at a proportionate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Accordingly, while the framework in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was proposed by See J in the context of offences of aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, I take the view that it should similarly be applicable to offences of outrage of modesty <span class="font-italic">simplic</span><span class="font-italic">iter</span> under s 354(1). I see no reason why the three main categories of offence-specific aggravating factors identified by See J for s 354(2) offences (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence, and the harm caused to the victim), which bear upon the assessment of the appropriate sentence, should be any different from those for s 354(1) offences. The only distinction between both provisions, on which the significant uplift in the imprisonment sentences that may be imposed for s 354(2) is premised on, is the age of the victim against whom the offence is committed: when the victim of the outrage of modesty is a child under 14 years of age, Parliament has signalled the additional gravity associated with the outrage of modesty offence by raising the statutory maximum punishment by two and a half times from two years’ imprisonment for s 354(1) offences to five years’ imprisonment for s 354(2) offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my view, given that the distinction between the statutorily permitted sentencing outcomes available for s 354(1) and s 354(2) offences is essentially premised on the difference in the age of the victim, the sentencing bands of imprisonment that were carefully calibrated by See J in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [31]) to reflect the full spectrum of possible sentences for s 354(2) offences could accordingly be scaled down linearly to cater to the statutory maximum punishment of two years’ imprisonment for s 354(1) offences. Therefore, the sentencing bands that would take into account the full spectrum of sentences that may be imposed for s 354(1) offences should be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Band 1</span>: less than five months’ imprisonment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Band 2</span>: five to 15 months’ imprisonment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Band 3</span>: 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 How then can this “two-step sentencing bands” approach  be reconciled with the “well-established sentencing benchmark” of nine months’ imprisonment with caning as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([10] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [9])? In my view, <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>still remains instructive in respect of its guidance that the starting point in respect of the imposition of <span class="font-italic">caning</span> is where the outrage of modesty involves the intrusion upon the victim’s private parts or sexual organs. Indeed, this was similarly recognised by See J in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As for the suggestion in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>([10] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that the benchmark imprisonment term is nine months’ imprisonment as a starting point, I am of the respectful view that this benchmark should no longer be followed. To this end, I make the following two observations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as a matter of principle, the approach adopted by the court in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span> is not suitable for the sentencing of offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>embraces the “benchmark” approach, which requires the court to identify an archetypal case (or a series of archetypal cases) and calibrate the sentence which should be imposed in respect of such a case. The problem with this approach is that the “notional case must be defined with some specificity, both in terms of the factual matrix of the case in question as well as the sentencing considerations which inform the sentence that is meted out, in order that future courts can use it as a touchstone” (<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">erence Ng</span> ([46] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [31]). In the context of the benchmark set in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee </span><span class="font-italic">Sze</span>, the court merely refers to the intrusion upon the victim’s private parts or sexual organs as the basis upon which nine months’ imprisonment with caning should be imposed. No other details are furnished to “allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the ‘norm’, and what exceptional situations justify departure from it” (<span class="font-italic">Abu </span><span class="font-italic">Syeed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 182 at [15]). Additionally, the benchmark approach is “particularly suited for offences which overwhelmingly manifest in a particular way or where a particular variant or manner of offending is extremely common and is therefore singled out for special attention” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [32]). Just like how the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>concluded that there is no such thing as a “typical” case of rape, I similarly find that there is no such thing as a “typical” case of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. There is, like for rape, great variance in the manner in which the offence of outrage of modesty can potentially present itself. The “benchmark” approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>may thus not suitably provide for clear, transparent, coherent and consistent sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, as a matter of practice, I note that even though the reliance on the “benchmark” approach is to be eschewed, the benchmark sentence of nine months’ imprisonment with caning as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>is not actually entirely inconsistent with the sentencing bands that I have proposed (at [49] above). The sole offence-specific factor highlighted in respect of the benchmark in <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>is the intrusion of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs. According to the sentencing bands as described in <span class="font-italic">GBR </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (see [45(b)] above), the presence of this factor would tend to place an offence within Band 2, which has an indicative sentencing range of between five to 15 months’ imprisonment (see [49(b)] above). The <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>benchmark sentence of nine months’ imprisonment is thus congruent with the proposed “two-step sentencing bands” approach in this regard. The upshot of this observation is that the adoption of the “two-step sentencing bands” approach does not actually conduce to a dramatically different sentencing outcome, in the exclusive context of s 354(1) offences that only involve a basic intrusion of the victim’s private parts (with no other offence-specific factors). But this does not render the proposed “two-step sentencing bands” approach otiose; the merits of the proposed approach only truly manifest themselves when the court deals with a case that presents a myriad of offence-specific factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 With all of the foregoing discussion in mind, I now turn to apply the legal principles canvassed above to the facts of the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two-step sentencing bands approach applied</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge cannot in any way be said to be manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The offence-specific aggravating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I begin by considering the relevant offence-specific aggravating factors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Degree of sexual exploitation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The victim here merely alleged that the appellant had touched her <span class="font-italic">groin area</span>, as opposed to her private parts. This distinction matters because whereas the <span class="font-italic">private parts</span> refer to the victim’s genitalia <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, the <span class="font-italic">groin area</span> is merely the junctional region between the abdomen and thigh, which includes the genitalia. In other words, if the victim’s groin area is touched, it does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that her private parts have been intruded upon; on the other hand, if the victim’s private parts have been intruded upon, it should <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the groin area is touched. Although the victim did state in P1 that the appellant’s hand was touching her “private part <span class="font-italic">area</span>” [emphasis added], I find this description too ambiguous to be the basis of a finding that the appellant had intruded upon the victim’s private parts or sexual organs <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. In any event, the victim had, during the course of trial, consistently testified that the appellant had touched her “groin area”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I also note that there was no skin-to-skin contact, with the touching taking place over the victim’s skirt.

The growing need for the courts to deter offenders from committing outrage of modesty cases on public transport has been highlighted on multiple occasions in Parliament. In 2013, Deputy Prime Minister and then Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean made the following remarks in response to a question posed in Parliament about what measures were being taken to ensure that commuters are not harassed or have their modesty outraged on public trains and buses (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 February 2013) vol 90 at Question No 33):

</div> The appellant submits that the victim’s evidence in this regard should be disregarded because the Prosecution did not submit a victim impact statement detailing the exact harm suffered by the victim. I disagree with the appellant. In my view, the lack of a victim impact statement should only affect the <span class="font-italic">weight</span> to be accorded to the victim’s evidence of psychological harm. In any event, I find it safe to accept the victim’s evidence in this regard because it is substantially corroborated by the evidence of PW3.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s Submissions dated 25 July 2017, para 93.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is trite that sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations are of relatively little, if any, precedential value because they are unreasoned and hence it will not be possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge or why the sentencing judge had approached the matter in a particular way: see <span class="font-italic">Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGHC 170 at [18], <span class="font-italic">Janardana</span><span class="font-italic"> Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1288 at [13(b)] and <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 3 SLR 180 at [11(d)]. Secondly, even considering the reported decisions that the appellant had cited before the District Judge below in support of his submission that a fine should be imposed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 890 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Pong</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiew Kiat v Public Prosecutor </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 927 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiew Kiat</span>”)), I am of the view that the present case is clearly sufficiently severe to warrant the imposition of a custodial sentence. In <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([10] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the court made the following observation regarding when the custodial threshold would be crossed for offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (at [12]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A fine would only suffice if the act of molest was a relatively minor one: see <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Pong v PP</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 890 where a tuition teacher with no antecedents was fined $500 on each charge for four charges for caressing a student’s thigh and a fifth charge of caressing her thigh and squeezing her back; and <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Yang Tick v PP</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 209 where an employer was fined $2,000 for slapping his secretary’s buttock lightly on the spur of the moment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The facts in <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Pong </span>have been helpfully summarised in the above excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze</span>. As for <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiew Kiat</span>, an employer with no antecedents was fined $4,000 for grabbing his foreign domestic worker’s buttock. In the present case, the appellant’s molesting act involved the deliberate touching of the victim’s groin area over a prolonged period of about a minute. It was thus not a mere fleeting touch, and was committed over an area that was extremely close to the victim’s private parts. A fine is thus clearly inappropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I now turn back to address the exact length of the imprisonment term that would be appropriate under the proposed “two-step sentencing bands” approach. Far from finding that the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge was manifestly excessive, I take the view that the sentence imposed was not inappropriate having regard to the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence and the harm caused to the victim. There is no good reason for me to disturb the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I also find that there is no need to disturb the sentence imposed on account of the applicable general offender-specific factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 First, I find the fact that the appellant is a first-time offender to be a neutral factor because it is not positive evidence of good character that could in turn be considered a valid mitigating factor: see Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2009) at paras 21.016–21.017, citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Sum </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022 at [32]. Also, the absence of antecedents is merely the absence of an aggravating factor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presence of relevant antecedents that thereby evince recalcitrance). It is trite that the mere absence of an aggravating factor cannot be construed as a mitigating factor which the appellant should be given credit for: see <span class="font-italic">Edwin s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Suse Nathen</span> <span class="font-italic">v Public P</span><span class="font-italic">rosecutor </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1139 at [24]–[26], <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1057 at [37] and <span class="font-italic">Chow Yee Sze </span>([10] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Secondly, I also consider the fact that the appellant had claimed trial to be a neutral factor. A plea of guilt is regarded as a mitigating factor that might entitle an offender to a reduced sentence because the plea of guilt: (a) can be a subjective expression of genuine remorse and contrition, which can be taken into account as a personal mitigating factor; (b) spares the victim the ordeal of having to testify, thereby saving the victim the horror of having to re-live the incident; and (c) saves the resources of the State which would otherwise have been expended if there were a trial (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>([46] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [66], citing <span class="font-italic">Regina v </span><span class="font-italic">Millberry </span>[2003] 1 WLR 546 at [27]–[28]). The appellant, by claiming trial and failing to plead guilty at the first instance, is thus not entitled to any sentencing discount in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Thirdly, I do not consider it necessary to impose a term of imprisonment in lieu of caning even though this court is empowered under s 325(2) of the CPC to do so for offenders certified unfit for caning under s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) on account of them being above 50 years of age at the time of caning. In <span class="font-italic">GBR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([45] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), See J made the following observations (at [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Following the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGHC 215 (“<span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah</span>”) at [53] and [58], it is clear that the term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so. The court should thus consider whether there are grounds to enhance the sentence by way of the imposition of imprisonment in lieu of caning. In an offence such as outrage of modesty, an imprisonment term in lieu of caning may be appropriate where there is the need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Leong and another appeal </span>[2017] SGHC 188 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong</span>”) at [91], cited in <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah</span> at [73]), for example, if there are substantial aggravating factors such as violence used or an exploitation of a particularly vulnerable class of victims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It is useful to pick up on the facts of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that was mentioned in the above excerpt to better illustrate the appropriate conclusion that should be reached in this regard for the present appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>an aesthetic doctor committed sexual offences against his patient, who was also the offender’s business partner and a fellow doctor. The offender was charged with, amongst others, three counts of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. On appeal, See J found the offender guilty of all three s 354(1) charges, and increased the sentences for each charge to 14 months’ imprisonment. In arriving at this sentence, See J exercised his discretion under s 325(2) of the CPC and imposed two months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning for each of the three charges under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. Critically, See J held that imprisonment in lieu of caning should be imposed in this case in order to give effect to the dominant sentencing objectives of deterrence and retribution. The need for deterrence was premised on the “gravity and egregiousness of the offending conduct” of the offender (at [88]), which was evinced in how the offender had shown a complete lack of remorse at trial, had “gravely abused his position of trust and authority as a medical professional to take advantage of his own patient, who was ostensibly also his protégé and business partner”, had engaged in actions that were “clearly planned and premeditated”, and had “indulged in multiple instances of skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis when the victim was completely unconscious, at his most vulnerable and defenceless” (at [86]). The need for retribution was premised on the need to reflect the retributive element in sentencing for offenders who abuse the trust reposed in them as medical professionals to commit the offences (at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Turning back to the facts of the present appeal, it is clear that the substantial aggravating factors identified in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) – such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim and the serious abuse of a position of trust – do not present themselves here. Hence, the sentencing considerations that displace the starting position that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced just because he is exempted from caning are not present. This is thus not an appropriate case to impose an additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the appeal against sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the result, I find that the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge was not manifestly excessive. I thus dismiss the appeal against sentence.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For all of the above reasons, I do not think that the District Judge’s decision to convict the appellant was wrong in law or had been reached against the weight of the evidence before him. I also do not think that the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment imposed on the appellant was manifestly excessive. I thus dismiss the appellant’s appeals against both his conviction and his sentence. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thangavelu and Syafiqah Ahmad Fu’ad (Thangavelu LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Ng Yiwen (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
