In her (amended) statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the Deceased passed away before the Geylang property was sold, but the Deceased had promised the plaintiff that the sale proceeds from the Geylang property would be used to repay the alleged loan. In the alternative, the plaintiff’s claim was premised on money had and received by the Deceased to the use of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In his (amended) defence, the defendant admitted that the amount of $308,308.15 was deposited into the Deceased’s POSB account but denied the purpose alleged by the plaintiff. He averred that the source of the deposit was not the plaintiff’s bank account.  The defendant then asserted that prior to the completion of the sale of the Circuit Road property, the plaintiff and her siblings had intended to make a gift of their respective shares in the sale proceeds to the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Further, the defendant alleged that the Deceased had on or about 25 April 2013 deposited a sum of $258,000 into the bank account of Thomas. He alleged that Thomas had requested from the Deceased funds to foot the medical and living expenses of Victor. Although the $258,000 was to be held on trust for Victor, the defendant claimed he had no knowledge of how the sum had been utilised by Thomas.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On 22 September 2016, the defendant issued a Third Party Notice against Thomas. In his (amended) third party statement of claim against Thomas, the defendant (after repeating the paragraphs in his defence to the plaintiff’s statement of claim) pleaded that if any party should be liable for the plaintiff’s claim, it should be Thomas against whom he claimed an indemnity and/or contribution for the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant also claimed an account of any monies from the $258,000 that Thomas had utilised towards the maintenance and upkeep of Victor between 25 April 2013 and 3 May 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In his defence to the third party proceedings, Thomas denied the defendant’s allegations regarding the $258,000 allegedly paid to him by the Deceased. Thomas averred that the Deceased used his bank account to deposit the said amount and subsequently, he had returned the same to the Deceased by way of two withdrawals of $58,000 and $200,000 on 7 May 2013 and on 3 June 2013 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The plaintiff and Mervin testified for the plaintiff’s case while Kee Yan was subpoenaed as the defendant’s witness.

The Deceased was particularly close to Emily whom she regarded and addressed as a mother and who in turn treated the Deceased like a daughter. However, this did not mean that the Deceased was in fact Emily’s child and the plaintiff’s sibling (as counsel for the defendant sought to prove in cross-examination of Kee Yan). The Deceased’s birth certificate clearly showed that Kim Lai was her mother. Moreover, this allegation was not pleaded in the defendant’s defence. If indeed, there was any basis for this unfounded theory, Emily’s Will would have included the Deceased as a beneficiary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 After his first stroke and until his demise, Victor lived first at the Circuit Road property and then at the Bedok Reservoir flat. It was Mervin and Thomas who took care of Victor in his later years. As the plaintiff so testified, it was compassion that prompted her and her siblings to allow Victor to live first at the Circuit Road property and then at the Bedok Reservoir flat.

She explained that lending $300,000 to the Deceased as the latter had requested posed a problem. That would have meant that what was left from the net sale proceeds, being $8,308.15 ($308,308.15 - $300,000), was difficult to divide amongst the four beneficiaries of Emily’s estate. Hence, the siblings decided to let the Deceased have the entire net sale proceeds instead.

It is noteworthy that the Bedok Reservoir flat was owned by the plaintiff and her husband. There was no evidence before the court that the plaintiff and/or her husband intended to sell the flat to the Deceased and/or to May Ling/May Ling’s husband.  It bears noting too that May Ling is married and lives in the United Kingdom.

That had nothing to do with the defendant.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The court also finds that the plaintiff has proven her case on a balance of probabilities that the $308,308.15 was advanced as a loan to the Deceased. She is entitled to be repaid the loan by the estate of the Deceased as the loan was extended to the Deceased on or about 24 April 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The loan represented the net sale proceeds of the Circuit Road property that the plaintiff and Kee Yan sold as executors of the estate of their late mother Emily, who was the owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The court finds that prior to 24 April 2013, the plaintiff and her siblings did intend to make an outright gift to the Deceased of the sale proceeds of the Circuit Road property. However, they subsequently changed their minds (which they were entitled to). They realised there was no need for such generosity on their part as the four beneficiaries of Emily’s estate had to share the sale proceeds of the  Circuit Road property whereas the Deceased owned the private Geylang property that was estimated to be worth $2.2m. Even after taking into account that the Deceased had paid Victor $900,000 to buy over his interest in the Geylang property, the Deceased was still looking at a net gain of $1.3m ($2.2m less $900,000) in the Geylang property as against $308,308.15 from their combined inheritance, a difference of almost $1m ($991,691.85 to be exact).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The emails produced in court in the Agreed Bundle showed that the Deceased had specifically requested a loan from her cousins. That could not be disputed by the defendant who, by his own admission (see [39] above) was not privy to the Deceased’s financial affairs in Singapore.  It would also appear from the Deceased’s email dated 29 March 2009 to Thomas that she did not want the defendant to know of her borrowings and financial affairs in Singapore.

The couple spent years living apart as the Deceased stayed in Singapore for long periods after her marriage for one reason or another, including eight years almost immediately after the marriage and another year from August 2012 to August 2013. During her first eight years away from the defendant, the Deceased did not even write to or maintain contact with the defendant who testified that he had to seek the assistance of the British High Commission here to find her as she did not reply to his letters.  In fact, according to the defendant’s AEIC, the Deceased spent about 16 of their 44 years of marriage living in Singapore, excluding her frequent trips spanning the periods 1979-1988, 1994-2005, 2009-July 2012 and August 2012-April 2014.  Such long periods of living apart meant the court was somewhat sceptical of the defendant’s claim that he “absolutely adored Vivien” and they “loved each other very much”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 What was most telling was the defendant’s conduct after the demise of the Deceased on 30 May 2014. On 4 November 2015, his solicitors demanded of the plaintiff the sale proceeds of the Circuit Road property. His solicitors followed up with a demand to Thomas on 30 November 2015 of the gift of the sale proceeds of the Circuit Road property, the rental proceeds of the Geylang Property and disclosure of any other assets that the Deceased may have had.  For good measure, the defendant then wrote to May Ling on 10 May 2016 to demand that she repay the $100,000 that the Deceased had supposedly entrusted to May Ling for the purchase of the Bedok Reservoir flat, when that sum was repayment of May Ling’s loan to the Deceased advanced in September 2012. Such conduct reflected poorly on the defendant, especially his (baseless) demand of the gift of the sale proceeds of the Circuit Road property.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendant’s conduct above not only belied his professed love of the Deceased but also showed that the defendant had no inkling of the Deceased’s financial affairs in Singapore, let alone the loans she had taken from the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s siblings over the years before her demise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(ii) The third party proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The defendant’s claim against Thomas was based on Order 16 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”).  Order 16 rule 1(1) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  Where in any action a defendant —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  claims against a person not already a party to the action any contribution or indemnity;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) claims against such a person any relief or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy claimed by the plaintiff; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) requires that any question or issue relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person not already a party to the action,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">then, subject to paragraph (2), the defendant may, after having entered an appearance if required to do so under these Rules, issue a notice in Form 16 or 17, whichever is appropriate (referred to in this Order as a third party notice), containing a statement of the nature of the claim made against him and, as the case may be, either of the nature and grounds of the claim made by him or of the question or issue required to be determined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In particular, the defendant pleaded that he was seeking an indemnity or contribution from the third party, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, under O 16 r 1(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic">.</span> In this regard, I note that the defendant’s allegation at paragraph 19 of his statement of claim against Thomas states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">….if any party should be liable for the plaintiff’s claim, it should be the Third Party. Accordingly, the defendant claims an indemnity from the Third Party for the plaintiff’s claim, and/or a contribution from the Third Party to a partial or full extent of the plaintiff’s claim, and under paragraphs 16-18 hereof, an account of expenses towards which the said sum of $258,000 had been utilized..</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Nothing was said by the defendant as to the basis for linking the plaintiff’s claim against the Deceased’s estate for repayment of the loan to his own claim against Thomas for an account of the sum of $258,000 allegedly given to Thomas by the Deceased.  As was pointed out by Thomas at paragraphs 15 and 16 of his closing submissions (citing <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 2 SLR 549), the defendant should have pleaded but failed to plead the legal basis for seeking an “indemnity” from Thomas and of a lesser sum at that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As for the defendant’s entitlement to “contribution” from Thomas, the relevant law is to be found in s 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A person shall be entitled to recover contribution by virtue of subsection (1) notwithstanding that he has ceased to be liable in respect of the damage in question since the time when the damage occurred, provided that he was so liable immediately before he made or was ordered or agreed to make the payment in respect of which the contribution is sought.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A person shall be liable to make contribution by virtue of subsection (1) notwithstanding that he has ceased to be liable in respect of the damage in question since the time when the damage occurred, unless he ceased to be liable by virtue of the expiry of a period of limitation or prescriptions which extinguished the right on which the claim against him in respect of the damage was based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 A plain reading of s 15(1) of the CLA shows that Thomas must be liable to the plaintiff on <span class="font-italic">her claim</span> against the Deceased for the loan <span class="font-italic">before</span> the defendant can seek a contribution from Thomas. However, it was never the plaintiff’s case or the defendant’s that Thomas was in any way liable for the loan. Indeed, in his opening statement (at paragraph 27), the defendant stated that an issue to be determined in this action is whether the defendant is entitled to an indemnity from the third party for the sum of $258,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 My view is reinforced by the following extracts from the defendant’s cross-examination by counsel for Thomas:

The Deceased was never in any case the “informal” owner of the Circuit Road property as the defendant alleged. The flat was originally owned by Kim Lai and her sister Lily Tan. Upon the demise of Kim Lai, her share devolved to Lily Tan as the surviving joint tenant.  In 2007, the flat was transferred to Lily Tan’s daughter Blossom who transferred it in turn to Emily in 2008 for valuable consideration.  It was then transmitted on 4 December 2012 to the plaintiff and Kee Yan as the executors of Emily’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Under cross-examination by counsel for Thomas,

</div> the defendant had admitted that $200,000 of the $258,000 that the Deceased deposited into Thomas’ account had been returned to the Deceased. Therefore his claim against Thomas, if any, was only for the balance of $58,000.  Moreover, on a balance of probabilities, I find that it was more likely than not that Thomas had returned $58,000 in cash to the Deceased on 7 May 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The court further notes that there was no evidence that the Deceased owned or had a share in the Bedok Reservoir flat as the defendant alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As pointed out at [28], despite the production in court of the Deceased’s birth certificate which clearly stated that Kim Lai was the Deceased’s mother, counsel for the defendant spent an inordinate amount of time cross-examining the plaintiff and Kee Yan on whether Emily was actually the Deceased’s mother or she had been adopted by Emily, to raise the suggestion that the Deceased could have inherited a share of Emily’s estate as her daughter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 All told, there was no evidence whatsoever from the defendant to rebut the plaintiff’s case that the loan and not a gift had been given to the Deceased on 24 April 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 On the other hand, the defendant was unable to prove his case in the third party proceedings on the facts and on the law, that Thomas is liable to indemnify the estate of the Deceased for the plaintiff’s claim or to the extent of $258,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Consequently, the plaintiff is awarded judgment and costs on her claim for $308,308.15 with interest at 5.33% per annum from 13 January 2016 (date of the writ) until judgment. The costs are to be taxed on a standard basis unless otherwise agreed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendant’s claim in the third party proceedings against Thomas (Lim Soon Wah) is similarly dismissed with costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The third party had submitted that costs should be awarded to him on an indemnity basis. For this submission, the third party relied on O 59 r 5 of the Rules as well as the United Kingdom case <span class="font-italic">Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of the Bank of England </span>[2006] 5 Costs LR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Three Rivers</span>”) and the local case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Yew Joseph v </span><span class="font-italic">Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd</span> [2013] SGHC 274 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chi</span><span class="font-italic">n Yew”</span>).         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Order 59 r 5 states:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Special matters to be taken into account in exercising discretion</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>  The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) any payment of money into Court and the amount of such payment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the conduct of all the parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) in particular, the extent to which the parties have followed any relevant pre-action protocol or practice direction for the time being issued by the Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Notwithstanding O 59 r 5, the award of costs on an indemnity basis (where there is no contractual provision) is an exception rather than the rule.  In <span class="font-italic">Tan Chi</span><span class="font-italic">n Yew</span>, the court had cited this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wong </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Cheong v Ling Ai Wah</span> [2012] 1 SLR 549 where indemnity costs were ordered in favour of the defendant from the two plaintiffs. At [199] of the judgment (as the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chi</span><span class="font-italic">n Yew </span>did at [98]), I had cited the following passage from Millet J’s ancillary judgment on the award of costs in <span class="font-italic">Macmillan </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc (No 3)</span> [1995]  3 All ER 747: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The power to order taxation on an indemnity basis is not confined to cases which have been brought with an ulterior motive or for improper purposes. Litigants who conduct their cases in bad faith, or as a personal vendetta, or in an improper or oppressive manner, or who cause costs to be incurred irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake, may also expect to be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis if they lose, and have part of their costs disallowed if they win. Nor are these necessarily the only situations where the jurisdiction may be exercised; the discretion is not to be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation on an indemnity basis must be ‘appropriate’.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The court notes that it was ill-advised on the part of the defendant to have joined Thomas as the third party to the proceedings. However, that in itself does not entitle Thomas to indemnity costs from the defendant as a matter of course. The defendant’s conduct has to be either egregious like the plaintiff(s) in <span class="font-italic">The Three Rivers</span> or in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chi</span><span class="font-italic">n Yew</span> or, he must have conducted his case in bad faith, or in an improper/oppressive manner or caused costs to be incurred irrationally or out of all proportion to what is at stake. Was that the case here?  I think not.  At best, the defendant was unreasonable in his pursuit of the third party proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The third party is therefore only entitled to costs from the defendant on a standard basis.  However, to show the court’s disapproval of the defendant’s unreasonable conduct, the third party shall have all his reasonable disbursements reimbursed by the defendant in full. In addition, the third party shall have his costs on the higher end of the scale. In other words, the Registrar taxing the third party’s bill of costs shall allow 10% to 15% more for each item that he taxes.               </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br>Senior Judge</br></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Jong Han Rey and Munirah Binte Mydin (KSCGP Juris LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Margaret Yeow Tin Tin and Lam Yi Wen Rachel (Hoh Law Corporation) for the defendant;<br/>Ng Lip Chih and Chiang Sing Hui Beatrice (NLC Law Asia LLC) for the third party.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
