There was one exception, a small dog that looked like Lassie, of whom Mdm Low was fond. Mdm Low invited poorer relatives to stay at 61 Kovan, and, at times during its heyday, there were close to 20 occupants.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I find that they did in fact know that Rosaline was coming and so made sure, at the least, that they arrived early that Sunday. I make this finding for two reasons. First, as Rosaline entered the premises, Roney, without any greeting to his aunt, started to record her on video, using his smartphone. This is consistent with his anticipating her arrival, and being well-prepared for it. Secondly, Jenny was at 61 Kovan on 7 June 2018 when it was repeatedly mentioned that Rosaline would be bringing her dogs. It is only natural, and I make this finding by inference, that Joanie knew too, either from her parents or from her siblings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The next question is whether Rosaline “charged” at Roney, as he testified repeatedly under cross-examination. I find that she did not charge at him. Instead, annoyed by his video recording while standing close by, she pushed him slightly. He exaggerated the force of her push, and even had the presence of mind to verbalise an accusation as he staggered backwards.

</div>
</div> I make this finding on the basis of the audio recording, as well as after hearing their respective descriptions of the incident when they gave evidence before me. Their relative sizes lent support to Rosaline’s version of events – had she truly charged at him I have no doubt that it would have been her who was felled by the impact rather than her nephew.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The third question is whether Rosaline tried to set her dogs on them. I accept her explanation that she was speaking sarcastically when she commanded her Labrador to bite them. This is supported by hearing the tone of her voice on the audio recording,

</div> which was, at the least, in too poor a condition to attack anyone, even if so minded. To be clear, it showed no sign whatsoever of any inclination to do so. The video recordings fully supported the conclusion that the dogs were friendly and no danger to anyone. I accept too that none of those present that day at 61 Kovan genuinely feared that either dog would bite them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The fourth question relates to hygiene. Here, I find on the basis of the video evidence that the Labrador in particular salivated excessively, and also panted very loudly, in a disturbing manner.

</div> The saliva dripped in a constant stream, puddling on the floor wherever the dog went. It was in no condition to climb the stairs and remained within the shared living area on the ground floor of the house. This is not the poor Labrador’s fault, but simply the result of its apparently poor condition. During the trial, it emerged that the dog passed away about 14 months later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The fifth question relates to whether and to what extent Rosaline cleaned up after her dogs on that day. I find that the quantity of saliva pooling on the floor was not easy to clean, and certainly not quickly. Rosaline can be heard on the audio recording assuring the others that she will clean up,

</div> I accept that Rosaline intended to clean up after her dogs, but I also accept that the quantity of pooling saliva and the length of time it went uncleaned meant that it was genuinely alarming for the other occupants of the shared living areas.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Nellie’s duty as administrator</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 An administrator’s principal duty is to distribute the estate as soon as possible.

</div> Perhaps Nellie should have gone to court to enforce the distribution rather than remaining stuck as administrator. There is no basis however for Rosaline’s claim that as administrator Nellie owes her a duty to implement her desire to live at 61 Kovan with her dogs. Nellie is under no duty, as administrator or otherwise, to ensure that their elder brother, Lian Chyu, behave in any particular way. She is neither her brother’s nor her sister’s keeper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Having heard her evidence, I concluded that Nellie is a natural peacemaker and conflict-avoider, taking after her mother in this respect.

</div> their right of residence flows from their rights as tenants in common under the gift. Moreover, any contractual licence would be one granted by the estate to the person or persons having the right of residence under the terms of the will. There is no room nor need to introduce the concept of a contractual licence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Trespass by ouster</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This claim is made only against Lian Chyu. Tenants in common have an undivided interest in land. Each is entitled to the whole of the property. Strictly, no tenant in common has the right to exclude any other from any part of the property. Thus, each of the siblings, as tenants in common, could choose to live there. How they would share the sleeping areas, the limited bathroom space, the kitchen and the garden would be no different from the accommodations and compromises that people make all the time, all over the world, in order to live together and enjoy the camaraderie and security of a home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It follows that it is wrong in law for any tenant in common to take possession of the property exclusively, preventing the rest from deriving benefit from it, including by their co-occupation, if so desired. This is what is described as ouster. Ouster may be actual or constructive. In this case, Rosaline relies on constructive ouster. As described in the Queensland case of <span class="font-italic">Paroz &amp; ors v Paroz</span> [2010] QSC 203, at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The conduct which seems to underlie the doctrine of constructive ouster is conduct by the party in occupation which manifests a denial of the rights of the other co-owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This description is consistent with the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chwee Chye and others v P</span><span class="font-italic"> V R M Kulandayan Chettiar</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 229, at [23] to [26], where unusually the co-owner in possession was seeking to argue that it had ousted the deceased co-owner so as to prove a claim in adverse possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my view, constructive ouster will include wholly unreasonable conduct of one tenant in occupation that effectively prevents another tenant from also residing there. In the case of residential premises, and especially where the tenants in common are family members, the court must have regard to the subjective feelings of the occupants, including likes and dislikes. The court must consider objectively whether, having regard to the subjective characteristics of the occupants themselves, the impugned conduct amounts to an ouster.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is not a question of who has acted more reasonably. The law does not set out rules concerning who in any household must give way to the other or who must be more reasonable. This applies as much to choice of pets as to anything else. Some people like dogs, others do not. It is important to assess whether any concern, interest or preference relied upon by either party is genuinely held, and has not been feigned for the purpose of making coliving difficult for the other occupant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Before turning to the question whether Lian Chyu’s conduct amounted to constructive ouster, I deal first with the question of Rosaline’s standing to sue, which was contested by Lian Chyu. As she has refused to accept transfer of legal title to her tenancy in common from Nellie, she presently only holds the beneficial interest to one-eleventh of 61 Kovan. To get around this, Rosalind joined Nellie as a defendant, so as to ensure that all necessary parties are before the court. That effectively deals with the question of standing. A further point was taken by Lian Chyu’s counsel to the effect that Nellie did not even have a beneficial interest in one-eleventh of 61 Kovan. I rejected this argument, which was based on a category error. The case law cited concerned the position of a residuary legatee in relation to assets of an estate (not themselves subject to specific bequests) prior to ascertainment of the residue. The law relating to the position of a residuary legatee has no bearing on the position of the recipient of a specific bequest, which is what 61 Kovan was. Moreover, long before these proceedings commenced, the estate was ready to distribute 61 Kovan, and had actually done so for all those beneficiaries who did not refuse distribution.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Turning back to the merits, Lian Chyu’s objections have always centred on Rosaline’s dogs. He has never denied her personal right of residence. Even in respect of the dogs, it has not truly been a blanket objection to them. In his email of 2 May 2017 he called them “ferocious” but assured Rosaline that she was welcome to stay.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Mostly, Lian Chyu has expressed concerns about specifics, such as her bringing the dogs into the shared living areas within the house, their excessive salivation and her delay in clearing this up. He also said that he was concerned that they might be allowed to defecate in the compound, and that if they did so Rosaline would not clear up immediately, attracting flies. I find that these concerns are genuine. From my observations of him in the witness box and as captured on the video recordings taken by Judy and Jenny on 7 June 2018, he seems to have been traumatised by Rosaline’s long history of allowing her dogs to come into the shared living areas, as well as allowing them to defecate in the compound and not cleaning up after them quickly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also consider that Lian Chyu’s actions have mostly been restrained and proportionate. When Rosaline placed the enclosure at the garage where he parked his car, he seemed genuinely upset by where it had been placed. Rosaline’s choice of location seemed a provocation. In response, he did not destroy it or dispose of it, but dismantled it and kept it to one side. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 By contrast, I find that Rosaline did not do very much to address her brother’s concerns. For example, she could have given assurances about where the dogs would defecate, and how she would ensure that excrement would be cleared. Indeed, she should also have given serious consideration to whether she should insist on bringing the dogs into the house itself, as opposed to keeping them in the general compound.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I hold that Rosaline has failed to show that Lian Chyu’s conduct toward her rose to the point of denying her right to reside at 61 Kovan. Brother and sister simply differed on the extent to which her dogs should have the run of the house, and what measures she should take in relation to them. I reject her contention that Lian Chyu has fastened on the issue of the dogs as an excuse to make it intolerable for Rosaline to live at 61 Kovan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I therefore conclude that there has been no trespass by ouster, whether in 2017 or 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I make one final observation under this issue. For the past fourteen years, Rosaline has had exclusive use of one room on the second floor.

</div> This remained the case during the years 2017 and 2018, when she claims to have been ousted from 61 Kovan. Throughout this time, and to date, she has not paid anything at all toward property tax or other outgoings of 61 Kovan. The relevance of this point is that the court, as described at [19(c)] above, gave Rosaline use of one bedroom in connection with her exercising her right of residence. It follows logically that in keeping her bedroom as she did she was affirming that she was indeed in residence. It is not open to her to claim she has been ousted. This is an additional reason why her claim for trespass by ouster fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Rosaline claims that Lian Chyu, Djau Ai and their children conspired to cause her injury by unlawful means. It is a prerequisite that the conspirators in an alleged conspiracy combine to do an unlawful act with the intention of injuring the claimant. I therefore turn to consider what the evidence shows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In relation to Djau Ai, there is really no evidence at all that she has taken any steps to hinder Rosaline’s residence or even shown any animosity toward her. In fact, having heard her evidence before me and reviewed the audio and video recordings, I find that she did her utmost to avoid getting drawn into the conflict that Rosaline had with Lian Chyu. Rosaline’s counsel in closing could not identify any act of Djau Ai that was directed at Rosaline. A wife is no more her husband’s keeper than a sister her brother’s. As with Nellie, Rosaline must have known from the start that there was no basis to sue Djau Ai.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Turning to the children, I have accepted that their presence at 61 Kovan on 17 June 2018 was not simply because it was a Sunday (see [26] above).  I find that they came that day because they wanted to support their father when Rosaline arrived. Roney especially, but also his sisters, took an active role. Roney play-acted when Rosaline gave him a small push when he was standing close to her. They must have known that their aunt was merely being sarcastic whenever she told her Labrador to bite them, and in their pleading made too much of those words. At the same time, I have no doubt that they were deeply concerned and worried about the effect of Rosaline’s actions on their aged father. They had genuine concerns for his health and well-being arising from Rosaline’s insistence on bringing her dogs and allowing them within the house.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The claim of unlawful means conspiracy depends upon there having been an intention to injure Rosaline, presumably by causing her to pay rental on 3 Leith Park for another year. I do not accept that they had any intention to injure her. I accept that their intention was simply to support their father and avoid any situation that might endanger his health. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Turning to the requirement of unlawful acts, the alleged unlawful act on their part identified by Rosaline was Roney’s making up that she assaulted him, in which he was supported by his sisters, and which they all repeated to the police.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Making false statements to the police is wrong and can in principle constitute an unlawful act for the purpose of establishing an unlawful means conspiracy. However, what Rosaline relies on is not a formal police report but what they said to the police officer attending at 61 Kovan on that day. I accept that her nephew and nieces were genuinely agitated by the events of that day. I have also held that there was contact in the form of a small push. Even though they may have embellished the story as they spoke to the police officer, I am not able to find that this constituted an unlawful act for the purpose of establishing an unlawful means conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: Damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Turning to the question of damages, my conclusions on liability mean that I do not need to consider it. However, I will make one observation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In relation to trespass by ouster, damages may take the form either of an occupation rent (also known as mesne profits) for the ousting tenant’s use of the property to the wrongful exclusion of others or alternatively compensation for loss suffered by the ousted tenant in common. Where, as here, the latter is sought, it must be shown that the loss resulted from the ouster.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, Rosaline did not need to rent 3 Leith Park in order to accommodate her dogs, if they could not stay with her at 61 Kovan. This is because she could have stayed in her bedroom at 61 Kovan while her dogs stayed at her apartment next door, at 59 Kovan. There is a side gate between the two compounds that she uses. Her explanation in the witness box that her dogs did not like the compound at 59 Kovan because there were more mosquitos on that side of the fence was not believable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Counsel submitted on costs in their written closing submissions and again during oral closing. Costs must follow the event, and I hold that Rosaline is to pay costs to Nellie, to Lian Chyu and Djau Ai, and to Roney, Jenny and Joanie. The trial took six days, and the claims raised some points of law that are not often encountered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In relation to Nellie, she would have been correctly joined as a nominal party, but Rosaline, without any basis to do so, made substantive claims against her. I would have considered carefully any argument for indemnity costs, but when addressing me on costs Nellie’s counsel was instructed to seek only standard costs, and to do so at the lower end of the scale. This was a further expression of her already demonstrated non-confrontational character. I fix costs to Nellie at $60,000, as well as reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For Lian Chyu and Djau Ai, I have observed that there was never any basis to include Djau Ai in these proceedings.  Lian Chyu had to defend against the most claims of any of the defendants. I fix costs at $90,000, as well as reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 For Roney, Jenny and Joanie, I fix costs at $60,000, as well as reasonable disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I dismiss the claims in their entirety and award costs to the defendants as set out at [57] to [59] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Three years have passed since that fateful day in June 2018, and almost two years since Rosaline returned to fulltime residence at 61 Kovan with her two dogs. Soon after, the old Labrador passed on, and she continues in residence with her golden retriever. I can only express the hope that the siblings’ halcyon days, when 61 Kovan under their mother’s charge resounded with laughter and good cheer, may yet find some echo in their silver years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam JC<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choh Thian Chee Irving and Wong Zhen Yang (Optimus Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Hweelon and Wang Qiuru Lynn (Veritas Law Corporation) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">A Shahiran Anis Bin Mohamed Ibrahim and Tai Kai Xuan Marcus (Asia Law Corporation) for the second and third defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran and Tan Wei Chieh (Prestige Legal LLP) for the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
