When the risk pays off, the investor will not cavil. If, however, the venture goes awry, the seeds of dispute are sown and may blossom into a full-blown civil suit. But when can an investor pin its losses arising out of the failed investment on the promoter of the investment?

And when can the promoter be considered to have crossed the Rubicon between the former and the latter?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These are questions that arise in the present suit.

</div> If the first defendant had represented that the $10m valuation was furnished by a professional valuer when it was not in fact so, then it would be a false statement of fact by the defendants giving rise to an actionable misrepresentation. It is clear therefore to the plaintiffs that the $10m valuation was the defendants’ <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> valuation of their own company, Mamanda, and they were offering potential investors (including the plaintiffs) the opportunity to buy shares in Mamanda without a premium to their <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> valuation of $10m for Mamanda.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Preliminarily, I am not persuaded by the defendants’ contention that the valuation representation was mere puff.

It refers to the classic “hard sell” made off-the-cuff by a salesman. It does not encompass representations such as the valuation representation that has been linked to the sale price for Mamanda’s shares. The statement made by the defendants indeed forms the very basis for the defendants’ pricing of the shares being offered to potential investors, as can be seen from the Mamanda prospectus. It is not something flimsy, imprecise and to be regarded as mere puff. Investment promoters such as the defendants cannot simply go around expressing in hyperbolic terms the value (in millions, no less) of an enterprise – indeed, they did not. The purport and tenor of such conversations are far more serious than a salesman making an off-hand pitch. A representation of this nature does not fit neatly alongside the “[e]ulogistic commendation[s]” that are commonly recognised as puff: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2002] SGHC 278 at [33].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 That said, the valuation representation is a statement of opinion, and not of fact.

</div> I am persuaded that the plaintiffs have not proved on a balance of probabilities that the defendants were dishonest or unreasonable in their subjective valuation of $10m for Mamanda. The defendants did not wilfully masquerade their opinion under the guise of the false fact that it was a professional valuation. There is no evidence whatsoever of the defendants having produced forged or inaccurate invoices or using inflated accounts of past profits to support their valuation with the intention to deceive the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have also not proven that the “Actual Figures” for the financial years 2013 and 2014 stated in the Mamanda prospectus were inaccurate in any material sense.

</div> It bears emphasis that the plaintiffs’ expert had to adopt the “Market Approach” instead (which she would not have used if she had the Mamanda prospectus) in order to value Mamanda. The “Market Approach” is basically an application of the “EV/EBITDA ratio” of comparable companies with similar business activities to assist in the valuation process. “EV/EBITDA ratio” is the “Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation” ratio.

In fact, given the size of the investments, the plaintiffs would <span class="font-italic">surely</span> have clarified the position; indeed, the first defendant’s evidence at trial is that he clarified with the plaintiffs prior to the making of their investments that the $700,000 fund-raising loan might have been <span class="font-italic">partially paid</span> <span class="font-italic">up </span>at that point in time (end-2015), but <span class="font-italic">not fully paid</span>.

</div> Conceivably, the first plaintiff understood that his allegation in this regard simply could not square with the documentary evidence available. The second plaintiff did not appear to adopt a different course of action during trial; nor could she explain how the capital return representation, if made, could be reconciled with the existence of the aforementioned disclaimer in the Prospectuses. I hence dismiss this portion of the plaintiffs’ claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The dividends representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The plaintiffs’ case in this regard fails because the dividends representation pertains to a future event. It is a statement made by the defendants that the plaintiffs may <span class="font-italic">in future</span>, after making investments in the Companies, receive dividends.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Existing case law makes it clear that actionable misrepresentations <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> bear elements of futurity. In this respect, it is worth reiterating the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>”) at [21]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 … A representation… relates to some existing fact or some past event. It implies a <span class="font-italic">factum</span>, not a <span class="font-italic">faciendum</span>, and since it contains no element of futurity it must be distinguished from a statement of intention. An affirmation of the truth of a fact is different from a promise to do something <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">futuro</span>, and produces different legal consequences. This distinction is of practical importance. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This point of law has been reiterated in numerous cases (see for example <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1310 at [93], citing <span class="font-italic">Bestland</span> ([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)). What is clear is that there is a crucial distinction between actionable misrepresentations and a <span class="font-italic">future promise</span>. In the context of commercial contracts, a claim relating to the latter<span class="font-italic"> </span>(a future promise of commercial returns) would fall more properly into the realm of contractual terms and the enforcement of the same. This could manifest in a claim in, for example, breach of contract (and not misrepresentation). Breach of contract, however, is not the plaintiff’s pleaded case; their pleadings are solely limited to a claim based on various misrepresentations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, I simply note that any claim in contract would have its own obvious problems as well, given that (and as pointed out by the defendants) dividends must be paid out of <span class="font-italic">profits</span>. The plaintiffs would have difficulty showing that there were available profits from which such dividends could be paid out pursuant to cl 2 of the Investment Agreements. Their claim in contract would thus also have been hamstrung. I say no more on this issue, given that a claim for breach of contract has not been pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The investment utilisation representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The plaintiffs’ case on this representation suffers from multiple difficulties.

</div>
</div> Accordingly, the Statement of Claim is demonstrably incorrect in so far as it characterises the investment utilisation representation as one pertaining to <span class="font-italic">all four</span> of the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On that premise, there are two reasons why the plaintiffs’ case is unviable. First, the Mamanda prospectus states clearly that “50% of the money raised will be use[d] to pay off some of [Mamanda’s] project financing”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-b16ffe71-e1b4-4b02-b751-895796cc1393" data-toggle="modal" type="button">66</button></sup>

</div> That being the case, I am not persuaded that the defendants made the investment utilisation representation as alleged by the plaintiffs – if they did so, they would have in effect expressed the exact <span class="font-italic">opposite</span> of what was printed in black and white on the Mamanda prospectus. My analysis in this regard is closely intertwined with my reasoning with respect to the debt representation (see [42] and [43] above). As mentioned, it is also pertinent that the second plaintiff accepts that she knew that, <span class="font-italic">prior to the plaintiffs’ investment</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Mamanda had undertaken a loan worth $700,000.

</div>
</div>
</div> Putting two and two together, the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">must </span>have known that part of their investments would be used to repay this loan. At the time the plaintiffs were shown the Mamanda prospectus, there was no evidence that this loan had been fully repaid. Indeed, when I questioned the second plaintiff on whether she was cognisant, at the time of investment, that such a loan was still outstanding, she simply asserted that “[i]t didn’t occur to [her]” – for obvious reasons, this cannot suffice.

</div>
</div> The first plaintiff has also offered no convincing reason for why he would have believed that (a) Mamanda did not have outstanding loans; and (b) his investments, <span class="font-italic">contrary to what the </span><span class="font-italic">Mamanda prospectus indicated</span>, would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be used to repay such loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Second, in any event, this representation is also a statement on something to be done in the future. It is about how the invested funds <span class="font-italic">will be</span> <span class="font-italic">utilised</span> moving forward. This point alone is fatal to the plaintiffs’ claim. As explained in the context of the dividends representation, this is a matter that ought to be governed instead by the terms of the agreement (see [51] and [52] above). A representation of this nature is not actionable in a misrepresentation claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Beta Global representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Beta Global representation, as it appears in the Statement of Claim, appears to have been made.

</div> However, this representation, much like the dividends and investment utilisation representations, is clearly a statement of future intent. The representation is that the Companies <span class="font-italic">will become subsidiaries of Beta Global in the future</span>, for an <span class="font-italic">anticipated</span> listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.

All in, the plaintiffs’ investments were worth $1m, which is a big investment. The plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">must</span> have read the Prospectuses with some care and done some due diligence before making their investments. I do not believe that investors of the plaintiffs’ stature would have taken the defendants’ words at face value, and made their investments simply by hanging onto the defendants’ every word based entirely on trust. It bears mention that there were other prospective investors present during the defendants’ pitches to the plaintiffs; these other investors, who were the plaintiffs’ “doctor-friends”, eventually opted <span class="font-italic">against </span>making investments in the Companies.

</div> In spite of this, the plaintiffs went ahead because they were predominantly persuaded by the defendants of their ambitious plans, the Companies’ future growth prospects and the potential listing of the parent company Beta Global Limited (with the Companies as its subsidiaries) on the Singapore Stock Exchange through an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). If so, they would be able to reap the profits on their pre-IPO investments after listing takes place. They cannot subsequently rely on the court to unravel their investments if it later turns out (as it has at present) that the Companies have not done as well as expected, and the possibility of an IPO is now extremely remote.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claim under section 2 of the Misrepresentation Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(1) Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As per <span class="font-italic">RBC Properties Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Defu Furniture Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 997 at [66], the elements of a statutory action under the Misrepresentation Act are similar to those at common law, except that it is for the defendant to prove an absence of negligence.
