<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The plaintiffs made two claims against

the defendant. The first was for the sum of $3,250,000 arising under an undertaking dated

24 March 1997 and the second was for the sum of $108,654 (with interest continuing to

accrue on the principal sum of $105,000) arising under a deed of guarantee dated 11

February 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The plaintiffs obtained summary

judgment against the defendant for both claims on 13 December 1999. The defendant then

appealed against the registrar’s decision. I heard the appeal on 25 January 2000. At

the hearing, the defendant dropped his appeal in respect of the amount claimed under the

deed of guarantee but continued with the appeal against the judgment for the sum of

$3,250,000 claimed under the undertaking. I dismissed this appeal for the reasons that

follow.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. In December 1996, the plaintiffs were

the lessees under a 30-year lease of the whole of private lot A7312 comprising part of

Government Resurvey Lot 1785 of Mukim 6 Peng Kang (‘the property’). They had

erected a theme park known as Tang Dynasty Village on the property and their main business

was that of operating the theme park.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The defendant was then the managing

director of a Singapore company called Admiralty Leisure Pte Ltd (‘ALPL’) that

wished to purchase the lease of the property and take over the theme park together with

its fittings and equipment. On 7 December 1996, a purchase and sale agreement to this

effect was entered into between the plaintiffs as vendors and ALPL as purchasers. The sale

was made conditional on certain ‘Necessary Approvals’ being obtained by 7 April

1997. Amongst these approvals was the consent of the lessor of the property, Singapore

Leisure Industries Pte Ltd, to the sale of the lease to ALPL. If any of the Necessary

Approvals was not obtained within the requisite period, the sale and purchase would not be

proceeded with.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. Clause 3.1.1 of the sale agreement

obliged the plaintiffs to apply to the lessor for consent to sell the property to ALPL

within seven days of the date of the agreement. The plaintiffs duly made the application

but the lessor took some time to respond. By mid March 1997, it was clear that the

lessor’s approval was unlikely to be obtained by the specified date of 7 April 1997.

It was the only one of the Necessary Approvals that was still outstanding. The defendant

then requested the plaintiffs to grant an extension of time of four months (ie up 7 August

1997) for the lessor to consent to the sale of the property to ALPL.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. The plaintiffs agreed to the

defendant’s proposal subject to his entering into an undertaking and indemnity with

them. This document was signed by the defendant on 24 March 1997. By it the defendant

agreed and undertook that in the event all Necessary Approvals were obtained on or before

7 August 1997 and ALPL thereafter refused or neglected to pay the sum of $7,050,000 being

the 15% of the sale price due under cl 5 of the sale agreement and/or the sum of

$2,700,000 being a payment due to the plaintiffs under cl 4.1.2 of a supplemental

agreement dated 7 December 1996, he would pay the plaintiffs the said sums and indemnify

them against all loss and damage suffered by them as a result of ALPL’s failure to

pay the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. By a letter dated 11 July 1997, the

lessor informed the plaintiffs’ solicitors that it had ‘no objection in

principle’ to the plaintiffs’ assigning the property to ALPL as the

assignee/lessee subject to various terms and conditions. One of these was that the

assignment had to be completed on or before the expiry of three months from the date of

the lessor’s letter. The letter also required the plaintiffs and ALPL to accept the

offer from the lessor by submitting various specified documents to it by 7 August 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The parties had some difficulty with

the condition requiring completion within three months of the lessor’s letter as the

sale agreement provided 75% of the purchase price to be paid by 12 instalments the last of

which was scheduled for 7 September 1998. Only upon full payment would the lease be

assigned to ALPL. Both parties wrote to the lessor asking it to modify this condition. The

lessor refused to modify its condition about the assignment, however, although it did

agree to enter into a fresh building agreement with ALPL. In the event the assignment was

completed within the time period specified by the lessor.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. Pursuant to cl 5 of the sale agreement

and cl 1.2 of the supplemental agreement, ALPL was to pay the sums of $7,050,000 and

$2,700,000 to the plaintiffs after the Necessary Approvals had been obtained. ALPL did

not, however, make payment of the full amount to the plaintiffs after 7 August 1997.

Instead, ALPL paid the plaintiffs only $6,500,000 on 21 September 1997. As a result, there

was a balance due to the plaintiffs of $3,250,000. This was the amount that the plaintiffs

proceeded to claim from the defendant under his undertaking.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Submissions and decision</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. The defendant’s main argument

before me was that the Necessary Approvals were not obtained before 7 August 1997 because

the lessor’s letter of 11 July was a conditional approval and that approval did not

become a ‘Necessary Approval’ until all the terms and conditions in the letter

had been fulfilled. There was one condition in the letter that was not fulfilled by either

the plaintiffs or ALPL before 7 August 1997 and therefore the terms of the sale agreement

had not been complied with within the extended period. Basically, the submission was that

the ‘Necessary Approval’ specified in the sale agreement had, in relation to the

lessor, to be an unconditional approval.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. I was not able to accept the

defendant’s submission. The lessor, when requested by the plaintiffs for consent to

the intended sale and purchase of the property, had three possible courses of action. It

could reject the request, it could consent to the transaction without conditions or,

thirdly, it could agree to the transaction with conditions. The defendant was aware of

this and he conceded in his first affidavit that the lessor had the right to impose

conditions on its consent. That this was a likely outcome of an application for consent

was recognised in the sale agreement itself since it contained provisions specifying how

certain conditions if imposed by the lessor would be treated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. As the plaintiffs submitted what the

defendant was trying to do was to say that it was agreed that any conditions that might be

attached to the lessor’s approval had to be accepted by the parties by the deadline

of 7 August 1997, otherwise the lessor’s consent was a conditional one which could

not constitute a ‘Necessary Approval’. I agreed with the plaintiffs’

submission that the defendant was confusing the lessor’s consent which alone was a

Necessary Approval with the parties’ acceptance of the conditions attached to the

consent. The date of acceptance of the lessor’s conditions had nothing to do with the

date when the lessor issued consent. That date was 11 July 1997 and was well within the

period specified for receipt of the approvals.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. Further, even if the defendant was

correct to say that the lessor’s conditions had to be accepted on or before 7 August

1997, the evidence was that such acceptance did take place by that deadline. When the

lessor made it clear to both parties that the conditions in the 11 July letter remained

unaltered, the parties accepted this position. Both sent letters to the lessor on 7 August

1997 agreeing to accept the lessor’s conditions. The plaintiffs’ letter was

written by themselves whilst ALPL’s solicitors wrote on their clients’ behalf.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. At the time the parties were clear

that the lessor’s letter of 11 July 1997 qualified as the lessor’s approval of

the sale. This is shown in the way that ALPL treated the stakeholding money. Under cl 4.1

of the sale agreement, ALPL had to pay by way of deposit a sum of $4.7 million of which

$500,000 was to be paid directly to the plaintiffs while the balance of $4.2 million was

to be held by the plaintiffs’ solicitors as stakeholders until all the Necessary

Approvals had been obtained whereupon the plaintiffs’ solicitors were entitled to

release the said balance to the plaintiffs without reference to ALPL.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. On the same day that the lessor sent

its letter of consent to the sale and purchase of the property, ALPL’s solicitors

wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to inform the latter that ALPL’s

instructions were that the balance of the ten percent deposit could be released to the

plaintiffs. In one sense this was an unnecessary letter in that once the Necessary

Approvals were in hand no authority was needed from ALPL for the release of the funds. In

another sense, however, it was useful as it showed that ALPL took the view that with the

receipt of the lessor’s letter of 11 July all the Necessary Approvals had been

obtained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Further, the plaintiffs’

solicitors wrote to ALPL solicitors on 12 July 1997 enclosing a copy of the letter of

approval from the lessor and stating that since all the Necessary Approvals had then been

obtained, the sale and purchase was final and no longer subject to conditions precedent to

be fulfilled. Neither ALPL nor their managing director objected to the statement at that

time or within a reasonable time thereafter. The first time any allegation was made that

the letter of 11 July 1997 did not constitute the lessor’s consent to the sale was in

the defendant’s affidavit resisting the order 14 application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. As a matter of construction, I could

not accept that the lessor’s letter of 11 July 1997 did not constitute the

lessor’s consent to the sale and purchase as required by the sale and purchase

agreement. The document did not require that consent to take any particular form. What was

necessary was simply an indication that the transaction had the lessor’s approval and

that the lessor would co-operate to allow it to be completed. Further, it was always

envisaged that conditions might attach to such consent and the parties, had they wanted to

rule out an unconditional consent, could easily have inserted wording to that effect. They

did not do so. The letter of 11 July indicated that the lessor was approving the

transaction subject to certain terms that were not unusual or impossible of compliance. In

the circumstances, I was satisfied that it was a genuine approval and thus qualified as a

consent on the part of the lessor to the sale of the property to ALPL and therefore meant

that the first Necessary Approval under the sale and purchase agreement had been obtained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. I therefore dismissed the appeal.</font></p>
