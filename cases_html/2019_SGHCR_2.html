As originally framed, it was an application pursuant to O 24 r 6(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). However, the order which was eventually sought by the plaintiff took a somewhat different form. This gave rise to the question as to whether SUM 3742 could be founded on O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC, or if some other basis for SUM 3742 had to be resorted to. In addition, SUM 3742 also implicated issues relating to the non-party’s supposed statutory duties of confidentiality, and the need for safeguards in an order for non-party discovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 SUM 3742 came before me over three hearings. The first hearing on 25 September 2018 (the “First Hearing”) was adjourned as the summons had not been served on the defendant (as required by O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC). Thereafter, I heard parties on their substantive arguments on 30 October 2018 (the “Second Hearing”) and 14 December 2018 (the “Third Hearing”) and granted the application.

Among other things, the non-party claimed that prayer 1 of SUM 3742 was over-inclusive, and suggested that it would have been sufficient for the plaintiff’s purposes if the plaintiff had requested an order that the non-party provide, by way of an affidavit, discovery of one document, or as many documents as is necessary, setting out in respect of each of the eight mobile telephone numbers in Schedule 1: (a) the name of the registered subscriber; and (b) the NRIC number or other form of identification number of the said registered subscriber (if any).

Presumably, the test being referred to is the expanded test of relevance under O 24 r 5(3) of the ROC (as opposed to the test under O 24 r 1(2) of the ROC), since an order for the disclosure of documents by a non-party under O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC will not be for general discovery of documents as under O 24 r 1 of the ROC, but for discovery of particular documents as under O 24 r 5 of the ROC (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> at para 24/6/5).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As noted at [6] above, the plaintiff’s case is that the various mobile telephone numbers were registered to the defendant or to a person or entity controlled by the defendant, and subsequently sold for a profit. It seemed to me that this claim implicated in one way or another each of the eight mobile telephone numbers set out in Schedule 1 at [10] above. Further, it was clear from the Defence that this claim is disputed by the defendant.

</div> Accordingly, it followed that the identities of the registered subscribers of these eight mobile telephone numbers were, to use the wording of O 24 r 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, “relevant to an issue arising … out of the claim made”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Necessity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The requirement of necessity is imported by O 24 r 7 of the ROC, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discovery to be ordered only if necessary (O. 24, r. 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7. </span>On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I was of the view that discovery was plainly necessary in this case. The identities of the registered subscribers of the eight mobile telephone numbers were central to the plaintiff’s case. Discovery would allow the plaintiff to make an informed decision as to whether it should proceed with its claim against the defendant, or if its recourse lay elsewhere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further, the plaintiff was only seeking the identities of the registered subscribers of the eight mobile telephone numbers within limited time periods (see [10] above). At the Second Hearing, I asked counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Natasha Cheng, to take me through each of the dates referred to in Schedule 1 at [10] above, and Ms Cheng was able to point to either an invoice or form which reflected each date alongside the corresponding mobile telephone number. This suggested to me that the scope of discovery which was sought was not any wider than what was necessary. It should also be noted that counsel for the non-party, Mr Brinden Anandakumar, confirmed that he was content with the time periods provided by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 What the non-party took issue with, however, was the fact that the plaintiff’s supporting affidavit in SUM 3742 attested to the defendant’s admission of personal liability for all the unpaid Credits purportedly sold to the Three Entities (see [13(b)] above). In this regard, the non-party pointed to a note which was exhibited in the plaintiff’s supporting affidavit in SUM 3742. This note was dated 1 March 2017 and appeared to be signed by the defendant and two witnesses. The note read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I Seah Yong Wai [NRIC number redacted] affirmed that I will repay Absolue Kinetics Consultancy Pte ltd</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Half of $1.027,854.00 by the end of March 2017. This is regarding the E load for pre-paid cards that AKC supplied to me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26  It appeared that this note had earlier featured in the defendant’s application in Summons No 925 of 2018, which was an application to set aside a default judgment that had been entered against him. The application was granted by an Assistant Registrar, who observed, in her oral grounds (which, in fairness to the non-party, the non-party was not privy to), that the defendant had asserted that the note was written under duress. In the final analysis, the defendant’s supposed admission was simply part of the plaintiff’s case. It was not an undisputed position, and therefore had no bearing on the necessity or otherwise of discovery in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 But the non-party had a second string to its bow, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant’s admission, in his first affidavit filed in SUM 3742, that he had used some of the eight mobile telephone numbers to purchase Credits (see [13(b)] above). This was based on para 11 of the affidavit, which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On behalf of Afronco Pte Ltd, I placed the orders on these numbers, through proper channels. I paid the orders using Afronco Pte Ltd’s money by cash or through Afronco Pte Ltd’s company account. The sales personnel, administration staff and management, were fully aware of these transactions coming from Afronco Pte Ltd. This can be from some of the whatsapp messages to various parties of AKC. They applied the company signboard of Afronco Pte Ltd from Singtel marketing and approved it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 To my mind, however, this submission was irrelevant to the issue of necessity. As Ms Cheng pointed out, the defendant was the plaintiff’s former employee, and would have placed orders on those numbers anyway. Accordingly, this second supposed admission by the defendant spoke nothing to the plaintiff’s case that the various mobile telephone numbers were registered to the defendant or to a person or entity controlled by the defendant, and subsequently sold for a profit (see [6] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possession, custody or power</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The requirement relating to the documents being in the non-party’s possession, custody or power is imposed by O 24 r 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC. This provides that an application for non-party discovery under O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC shall be supported by an affidavit which must, among other things:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… show … that the person against whom the order is sought is <span class="font-italic">likely to have or have had </span><span class="font-italic">[the documents in respect of which the order is sought] in his </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">possession, custody or power</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Implicit in this requirement is the logically-anterior assumption that the documents in question <span class="font-italic">exist</span>. In my view, this was where SUM 3742 ran into an insuperable difficulty. Before me, Mr Anandakumar explained that if SUM 3742 were granted, what the non-party would do would be to file an affidavit exhibiting a spreadsheet containing the relevant information. Crucially, Mr Anandakumar also confirmed that, at the time SUM 3742 was taken out, this spreadsheet <span class="font-italic">did not exist</span>. Indeed, it did not exist even at the time of the Third Hearing. Instead, it was something that the non-party <span class="font-italic">would</span> put together in the event SUM 3742 were granted. Accordingly, it could not be said to be in the non-party’s possession, custody or power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For this reason, I was of the view that, in respect of the O 24 r 6(2) Issue, SUM 3742 could not be founded on O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Form of the order which was sought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Before leaving the O 24 r 6(2) Issue, I should add one further observation. Even if all the requirements for an order under O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC, as set out at [17] above, were satisfied, I had some doubts over whether the form of the order which was sought fell within the ambit of O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC. This was because the provision in O 24 r 6 of the ROC which appeared to be applicable to SUM 3742 was O 24 r 6(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC. This provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) An order for the discovery of documents may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  require the person against whom the order is made to <span class="font-italic">make an affidavit stating whether the documents specified or described in the order are, or at any time have been, in his possession, custody or power and, if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with them and what has become of them</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It was immediately evident that the order which was sought (see [10] above) did not fall within this description. While O 24 r 6(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC seems, on its face, to be permissive (as evidenced by the word “may”), there is in fact no other provision in O 24 r 6 of the ROC that suggests what form an order under O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC should take. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I raised this particular concern to parties, and various possibilities were mooted in the course of submissions. For instance, Ms Cheng suggested that O 24 r 6(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC was only invoked in circumstances where the non-party confirmed that the documents were not in his possession. With respect, however, this cannot be the case because O 24 r 6(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC requires the non-party to state in the affidavit, among other things, <span class="font-italic">whether</span> the documents specified or described in the order are, or at any time have been, in his possession, custody or power. On his part, Mr Anandakumar pointed to O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) An order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings or for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In particular, Mr Anandakumar emphasised that the Court could, pursuant to O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC, make an order “on such terms as it thinks just”. However, it is clear that the phrase “on such terms as it thinks just” relates to the earlier reference in O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC to “[a]n order … for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings”. And this, in turn, refers to the order referred to in identical terms in O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC, which has been reproduced at [16] above. The phrase “on such terms as it thinks just” allows the Court to impose additional terms when it makes such an order, but it does not answer the prior<span class="font-italic"> </span>question of what form such an order should <span class="font-italic">itself </span>take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, given my findings at [29]–[31] above, it was not necessary for me to come to a firm view on these difficulties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Inherent Powers Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Inherent Powers Issue was whether SUM 3742 could be founded on the Court’s inherent powers. It is apposite to begin the analysis by highlighting two points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, while the non-party highlighted various concerns with SUM 3742, the fact that the spreadsheet which was sought did not exist was not one such concern. In fact, the provision of a spreadsheet was <span class="font-italic">suggested by the non-party</span> (see [9] and [30] above). As I understood it, the non-party suggested as such because it took the view that such an order would be a <span class="font-italic">less</span> intrusive means of disclosing information found in underlying documents that were indisputably in its possession, custody or power. Further, the plaintiff was agreeable to this proposed course of action (see [10] above). In these circumstances, it was apparent to me that justice would not be served if SUM 3742 were defeated simply because the spreadsheet which was sought did not exist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, such an order was not unprecedented. In this regard, Mr Anandakumar drew my attention to similar orders made by the High Court in Originating Summons No 347 of 2017 (“OS 347”) and Originating Summons No 858 of 2018 (“OS 858”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Taken together, these two points necessitated the search for an alternative basis for SUM 3742. In the course of the Second Hearing, Mr Anandakumar suggested that the Court’s inherent jurisdiction could be the basis upon which SUM 3742 could be granted (although he appeared to recoil from this position at the Third Hearing). Further, although no written grounds were issued in either OS 347 or OS 858, the preambles of the orders extracted in both cases begin as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to Order 24 Rule 6 of the Rules of Court and/or pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">inherent jurisdiction</span> of the Court … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Before proceeding further, it is perhaps appropriate to clarify that there is a difference between the Court’s inherent <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span>, on the one hand, and the Court’s inherent <span class="font-italic">power</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, on the other. While the two terms are often used interchangeably, there remains a distinction between them which I think is helpful to bear in mind. This distinction was explained by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">BBW v BBX and others</span> [2016] 5 SLR 755 (at [19]) (“<span class="font-italic">BBW</span>”) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As stated at [1] above, the second ground for [BBW]’s applications was based on the court’s inherent jurisdiction. Before proceeding further, I should state this was somewhat of a misnomer. In <span class="font-italic">Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</span> [2013] 3 SLR 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>”), the Court of Appeal clarified (at [32]) that the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> of a court and the <span class="font-italic">powers</span> of a court are “two distinct and entirely different concepts”. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The jurisdiction of a court is “its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it”, whereas the powers of a court “constitute its capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute”</span> (<span class="font-italic">M</span><span class="font-italic">uhd Munir v Noor Hidah</span> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 348 at [19] cited in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> at [31]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> further exhorted (at [41]) that in the interests of conceptual clarity, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it would be preferable to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">refer to the exercise of the right to regulate matters properly before the court as the exercise of the court’s inherent powers rather than its inherent jurisdiction</span>. Given the nature of [BBW]’s applications, it was clear to me that what [BBW] was really relying on was the court’s inherent <span class="font-italic">power</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Like in <span class="font-italic">BBW</span>, the relevant concept in the present case was that of the Court’s inherent <span class="font-italic">power</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, and it is to this that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Court’s inherent powers generally</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As observed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [80], and albeit in the context of an earlier edition of the ROC), the Court’s inherent powers find their recognition in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, O 92 r 4 of the ROC, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inherent powers of Court (O. 92, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span> For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Court’s inherent jurisdiction should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands (<span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 at [17]). Indeed, it has been said that the key criterion justifying invocation of O 92 r 4 of the ROC is that of “need” – in order that justice be done and/or that injustice or abuse of process of the Court be avoided (<span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span> at [81]). How the Court’s inherent jurisdiction should be exercised should not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests (<span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Having regard to these general principles, it followed from what I have said at [38] above that this was a proper case for the Court’s inherent powers to be exercised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Court’s inherent powers in the context of O 24 r 6 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 But the analysis can be taken yet a step further. In <span class="font-italic">UMCI Ltd v Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 95 (“<span class="font-italic">UMCI</span>”), the High Court had occasion to consider the Court’s inherent powers in the specific context of O 24 r 6 of an earlier edition of the ROC. One of the issues before the Court was whether, in respect of documents that were being ordered to be discovered or produced for inspection under O 24 r 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2006”), the Court had the power under O 24 r 6 of the ROC 2006 to <span class="font-italic">further</span> order that the original documents be handed over to the applicant for examination. The Court held that it did have such a power. However, and relevantly for present purposes, the Court also held that even if it did not have such a power, it would be within the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to make such an order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In arriving at this conclusion, the Court held (at [92] and [96]) that the Court’s inherent jurisdiction may be resorted to, to make orders that are reasonably necessary in order for justice to be done in a case or to prevent any abuse of the process of the Court. In particular, this extends to the power to make suitable orders and directions that are reasonably required to prepare the way for a just and proper trial of the issues between the parties and for evidence to be gathered. Such jurisdiction will be exercised having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the order sought, whether it may result ultimately in a saving in costs, the degree of intrusiveness the non-party may be required to endure, and the availability of the evidence through other means.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I was cognisant that this test was established in a slightly different context but, to the extent that it simply elaborates on the general principles set out at [43]–[44] above, I saw no reason why it could not apply to the present case. To this end, I was of the view that it was amply satisfied. The issue of necessity has already been addressed at [22]–[28] above. Further, the considerations referred to in <span class="font-italic">UMCI </span>also pointed towards the exercise of the Court’s inherent powers. As alluded to at [38] above, the order which was sought was a less intrusive means for the non-party to disclose information found in underlying documents that were indisputably in its possession, custody or power. Such an order might have also resulted ultimately in a saving in costs, should it have turned out that the plaintiff’s recourse lay elsewhere (see [23] above). And apart from the non-party, it was not immediately evident that there were other means of obtaining the same evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For these reasons, I was satisfied that the Court’s inherent powers could and should be exercised in the present case. In respect of the Inherent Powers Issue, therefore, I was of the view that SUM 3742 could be founded on the Court’s inherent powers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Confidentiality Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As I was of the view that SUM 3742 could be founded on the Court’s inherent powers, it was necessary to consider the Confidentiality Issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the non-party’s duties of confidentiality militated against SUM 3742 being granted. The Confidentiality Issue arose because the non-party claimed that it owed statutory duties of confidentiality to its subscribers (see [14] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Both parties referred to the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Haywood Management Ltd v Eagle Aero Technology Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 478 (“<span class="font-italic">Haywood</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Haywood</span> was a case relating to, among other things, <span class="font-italic">pre-action</span> disclosure, but there is no reason why the principles enunciated therein would not be applicable in the context of non-party discovery. Two points are key. First, when a defendant seeks to rely on a confidentiality clause to oppose an application for pre-action disclosure, the Court has to determine whether the information sought falls within the scope of the confidentiality clause (<span class="font-italic">Haywood </span>at [52]). Second, where a defendant manages to establish that the information sought to be disclosed falls within the scope of its confidentiality obligations, there remains the issue of whether the Court ought to favour confidentiality, at least in the context of pre-action discovery (or, in the present case, in the context of non-party discovery) (<span class="font-italic">Haywood</span> at [53]). In this regard, confidentiality obligations do not operate as a <span class="font-italic">trump</span> to foreclose disclosure. Rather, they are a factor to be taken into account in what is essentially a <span class="font-italic">balancing</span> exercise. As explained by the Court (at [55], [56] and [57]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 … <span class="font-italic">[T]he fact that the defendant may owe confidentiality obligations to other parties </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">does not mean that the application for pre-action discovery must necessarily fail</span>. ... [A]ny obligations of confidentiality that the defendant may owe to other parties <span class="font-italic">cannot be a decisive consideration</span>. It is <span class="font-italic">but one factor that the court should take into account in ascertaining where the interests of justice lie</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 In deciding whether to grant pre-action discovery when confidentiality obligations are at stake, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the court has to balance the interests of the applicant against those of the defendant</span>. On one hand, the plaintiff may have a legitimate interest in requiring access to the documents in order to ascertain the viability of its intended cause of action. In this regard, the courts should be careful not to allow legitimate claims to be stifled by indiscriminate objections on the ground of confidentiality. On the other hand, the defendant may have a legitimate interest in maintaining any confidentiality obligation owed to other parties. In this respect, the courts should not allow the reasonable expectations of contracting parties to be defeated by fishing expeditions hinged on frivolous or speculative claims. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 Ultimately, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the court will have to adopt a multi-factorial approach in determining whether the interests of justice necessitate the disclosure by the defendant in spite of the confidentiality obligations it owes to other parties</span>.

</div> but this, in my view, was more germane to the Safeguards Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, the non-party submitted that the Court should also take into account whether there existed an alternative and more appropriate method of obtaining the information the plaintiff was seeking from the non-party. In this regard, the non-party highlighted that the plaintiff could have, for example, served interrogatories on the defendant.

</div> However, it was not clear to me that interrogatories served on the <span class="font-italic">defendant </span>(as opposed to the non-party) would yield the same information. As I have already noted at [48] above, it was not immediately evident that, apart from the non-party, there were other means of obtaining the same evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Haywood</span>, the Court found (at [64]) that the appellant had failed to substantiate <span class="font-italic">how</span> the disclosure of the requested documents would be against the interest of justice. For the two reasons set out at [53]–[54] above, the same could be said in the present case. In<span class="font-italic"> </span>the circumstances, there was no reason why confidentiality ought to be favoured. In respect of the Confidentiality Issue, therefore, I was of the view that even if: (a) the non-party’s statutory duties of confidentiality existed; and (b) the information sought fell within the scope of such duties, such duties did not militate against SUM 3742 being granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Safeguards Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As I had decided that SUM 3742 could be founded on the Court’s inherent powers, and that the non-party’s duties of confidentiality did not militate against it being granted, the final issue was the Safeguards Issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether there should be any safeguards imposed in the granting of SUM 3742.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the Safeguards Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Safeguards Issue arose from the non-party’s position that, if the plaintiff intended to bring proceedings against other potential wrongdoers, the non-party would seek to highlight certain safeguards for the Court’s consideration (see [13(c)] above). The Safeguards Issue was raised for the first time at the Second Hearing <span class="font-italic">via</span> written and oral submissions. At that hearing, Ms Cheng was unable to provide any firm response as to what the plaintiff intended to do with the information obtained from the spreadsheet which was sought. But she really could not be faulted for this. First, as the Safeguards Issue was raised for the first time at the Second Hearing, there was really no reason to expect Ms Cheng to have taken instructions on this. Second, as I pointed out to parties at the Second Hearing, it seemed slightly premature for the plaintiff to have taken a position on this when the spreadsheet which was sought in SUM 3742 had not even been made available yet. Accordingly, I adjourned SUM 3742 and gave directions in relation to the Safeguards Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Pursuant to these directions, the plaintiff wrote in to Court on 13 November 2018 to set out its intended course of action should SUM 3742 be granted. The material paragraphs of its letter were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. … [S]hould the Plaintiff's application be granted, the Plaintiff will in the first place write to each of the identified registered subscribers along the lines as set out in the proposed draft letter enclosed in Appendix A herewith.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.  In the event the registered subscriber responds and it is established that he, she or it did not have any involvement in the placing of the orders for the Credits and did not benefit from the Credits at all, the Plaintiff will not take any action against such a registered subscriber.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. If on the other hand, no response is received from a particular registered subscriber, the Plaintiff will have to decide whether to take any action against that registered subscriber. The Plaintiff is however unable at this juncture to confirm whether any action will be taken at all.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. If however the Plaintiff is aware that the registered subscriber is someone who is closely related or connected to the Defendant or an entity controlled by the Defendant, then the Plaintiff may not even write to that particular registered subscriber as the information would corroborate the Plaintiff’s case against the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. We would like to respectfully highlight that the steps that the Plaintiff would take will still depend every much on the information supplied by the non-party and by the registered subscribers, if any. Accordingly, at this juncture, the Plaintiff is unable to set out all that it intends to do, should the application be allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Appendix A of this letter (which was referred to in para 3 of the same) was a draft letter to the registered subscribers (the “Draft Letter”). The Draft Letter set out some background before proceeding to pose the following five questions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. Do you know Seah Yong Wah? If so, please let us know how you came to know him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. As you are<span class="font-italic"> </span>the registered subscriber of the Mobile Number?

If not, do you know who did?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The non-party subsequently wrote in to Court on 27 November 2018. In its letter, the non-party took the position that safeguards should be imposed in the event an order was granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I subsequently fixed the matter for hearing and also gave directions for the filing of further written submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions on the Safeguards Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As I understood it, the main crux of the plaintiff’s submissions on this issue was that the non-party’s concern had been catered for in the Draft Letter. Further, reference was also made to the plaintiff’s obligations (or, more accurately, the plaintiff’s solicitors’ obligations) under r 8(4) and (5) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015). Accordingly, it was contended that no further safeguards were required.

However, whether this power should be <span class="font-italic">exercised</span> was a different matter and remained governed by the key criterion of “need”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At the Third Hearing, it became evident that the parties were broadly agreed on the Safeguards Issue. Mr Anandakumar clarified that the non-party was not objecting to the Draft Letter; it was simply asking that the Additional Statements be included. On her part, Ms Cheng indicated that the plaintiff was agreeable to including the Additional Statements in the Draft Letter (subject to the precise wording of the first Additional Statement being fine-tuned) and to providing the accompanying undertaking by way of affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I was content to impose safeguards in the granting of SUM 3742. Aside from the fact of parties’ broad agreement, I was satisfied that such safeguards would also be necessary to guard against the potential for abuse highlighted by the non-party (see [63] above). In respect of the Safeguards Issue, therefore, I was of the view that there should be safeguards imposed in the granting of SUM 3742. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In light of my conclusions on the O 24 r 6(2) Issue (see [31] above), the Inherent Powers Issue (see [49] above) and the Confidentiality Issue (see [55] above), I granted, pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers, an order in the terms set out at para [10] above, save that the reference to “Singtel” was to be replaced by the non-party’s full name.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In light of my conclusion on the Safeguards Issue (see [66] above), this order was subject to the plaintiff’s undertaking, which was to be exhibited in an affidavit, that the plaintiff’s first letter to the non-party’s registered subscribers as identified in accordance with this order was to be in the form of the Draft Letter, save that: (a) the Draft Letter was to include the Additional Statements in a wording parties were to agree on; and (b) two typographical errors were to be corrected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for costs, O 24 r 6(9) of the ROC provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9) Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made in accordance with this Rule for an order, the person against whom the order is sought shall be entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying with any order made thereon on an indemnity basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The non-party submitted that costs should be payable on an indemnity basis. A sum of $1,000 was sought in respect of the costs of compliance, and a sum of $18,000 to $20,000 (all in) in respect of the costs of SUM 3742. The plaintiff agreed that it had to pay costs. However, it submitted that costs should not be on an indemnity basis. The plaintiff was agreeable to paying $1,000 for the costs of compliance, but submitted that the costs of SUM 3742 should be fixed at $3,000 to $7,000 (all in).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Notwithstanding that O 24 r 6(9) of the ROC was not strictly applicable, I saw no reason to depart from the default position of costs on an indemnity basis. The non-party was an innocent party with no interest in S 1149, and this did not change just because SUM 3742 was granted pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers and not O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC. As regards quantum, I took as a starting point the range of $2,000 to $6,000 stipulated for discovery applications in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (1 January 2013 release). However, I bore in mind that this range: (a) can be awarded for a single hearing; (b) excludes disbursements; and (c) is presumably premised on costs on the standard basis. In the present case, SUM 3742 was substantively argued over two hearings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Second and Third Hearings), for which two rounds of written submissions were prepared. There was also parties’ brief attendance at the First Hearing. Further, Mr Anandakumar quantified the non-party’s disbursements at around $1,000, and an uplift had to be applied to take into account the fact that costs were to be on an indemnity basis. In light of these considerations, I ordered the plaintiff to pay the non-party the costs of SUM 3742, on an indemnity basis, fixed at $10,000 (all in) and the costs of complying with this order, also on an indemnity basis, fixed at $1,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Finally, I also ordered that the non-party was to comply with the order set out at [67] above within two weeks from the time: (a) the plaintiff filed its affidavit exhibiting the undertaking referred to at [68] above; and (b) the plaintiff paid the costs ordered at [71] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript: O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Before ending off these grounds of decision, I add a final observation on O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC. For ease of reference, I reproduce this provision again:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) An order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings or for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Up to the Second Hearing, the only significant reference to O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC by parties was as I have set out at [34]–[35] above. In its further written submissions, and at the Third Hearing, however, the non-party contended that the SUM 3742 was based on both O 24 r 6(2) and (5) of the ROC.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In my view, however, there was no real need to consider O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC. First, O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC is not a standalone provision. As I have alluded to at [35] above, the reference therein to “[a]n order … for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings” refers to the order referred to in identical terms in O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC, which has been reproduced at [16] above. Thus, although case law establishes a test for applications under O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC, it is apparent that this test must apply <span class="font-italic">in addition to </span>the requirements for an order under O 24 r 6(2) of the ROC, which I have set out at [17] above. These requirements include the requirement, imposed by O 24 r 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, relating to the documents being in the non-party’s possession, custody or power. For the reasons set out at [29]–[30] above, this requirement was not satisfied. Accordingly, SUM 3742 could not have been granted pursuant to O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, added to the above was Ms Cheng’s clarification, in no uncertain terms, that the plaintiff’s main focus was to corroborate its case against the defendant. This was consistent with the plaintiff’s further written submissions, which stated that the plaintiff’s intention was to discover the link or relationship between the defendant and the newly-identified parties, and not to bring a new action against the same.

</div>
</div>
</div> It must be recalled that SUM 3742 was the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s</span> application. And as the plaintiff was not relying on O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC in any meaningful way, I saw little reason to substantively engage the point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 There was, however, one possible way in which O 24 r 6(5) of the ROC could have been relevant to SUM 3742, and this related to the <span class="font-italic">Riddick</span> principle. The <span class="font-italic">Riddick </span>principle derives from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd</span> [1977] 1 QB 881. As Lord Denning MR held (at 896), there is an implied undertaking that “[a] party who seeks discovery of documents gets it on condition that he will make use of them only for the purposes of that action, and no other purpose”. The scope of this undertaking would be clear if SUM 3742 were granted pursuant to either O 24 r 6(2) or (5) of the ROC. However, it would be less so if SUM 3742 were granted pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It was tempting, in these circumstances, to express some sort of a view on this issue. However, I eventually declined to do so. The issue of the scope of the undertaking pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">Riddick</span> principle which applied in this case was not properly before me in SUM 3742. Indeed, this issue would only become live should the plaintiff choose to proceed against any of the non-party’s registered subscribers identified as a result of SUM 3742 being granted. Even then, it would presumably be for these registered subscribers, and not the non-party, to take up any objection on the basis of the <span class="font-italic">Riddick</span> principle. Further, I did not think that the scope of the undertaking pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">Riddick</span> principle which applied in this case was entirely opaque just because I had granted SUM 3742 pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers. This was something that could be determined by reference to my orders (and, I should add, these grounds of decision). Finally, Ms Cheng had also accepted that if SUM 3742 were granted pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers, the <span class="font-italic">Riddick</span> principle <span class="font-italic">would</span> apply to prevent the plaintiff from commencing a fresh action, unless the plaintiff first applied for a release from this undertaking. This, in my view, would go some way in addressing the issue.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Jonathan Ng Pang Ern  <br/>Assistant Registrar  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Natasha Cheng Yi Hui and Lim Charmaine Jillian Phipps (Eldan Law LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Jeeva Arul Joethy (Regent Law LLC) for the defendant;<br/>Brinden Anandakumar (Fullerton Law Chambers LLC) for the non-party.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
