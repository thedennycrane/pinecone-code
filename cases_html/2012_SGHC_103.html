<p class="Judg-Heading-1">1.   Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application raises two issues: first, whether the
                    Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s
                    (“SGX-ST”) public reprimand of a
                    director of an SGX-ST listed company is susceptible to
                    judicial review? And second, if it is, whether the applicant
                    was accorded a fair hearing as required by the rules of
                    natural justice?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applicant, who was, during the material time, a
                    non-executive director of China Sky Fibre Chemical Limited
                    (“China Sky” or
                    “Company”), applied for leave to apply
                    for a quashing order of the SGX-ST’s reprimand of
                    him, on 16 December 2011 (“SGX-ST
                    Reprimand”) and was granted leave. The gist of
                    his complaint is that SGX-ST reprimanded him in breach of
                    the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">2.   Judicial Review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Judicial review is the limited means through which the
                    court holds bodies exercising a “public” function to fundamental
                    thresholds of legality. It is to be emphasised that in
                    judicial review the court is not concerned with the merits
                    or correctness of the decision under review. Judicial review
                    is not an appeal to the court nor does the court substitute
                    its own judgment for that of the decision-maker. In the
                    exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, the court confines
                    itself to reviewing the decision making process, to ensure
                    that the process met the standards of “legality,
                    rationality and procedural propriety” (per
                    Lord Diplock in <em>Council of Civil
                        Service Union v. Minis    ter for the Civil
                        Services</em> [1985] A.C. 374).
                    Since judicial review is confined to decisions which are
                    characterised as being of a public function, it is
                    unavailable for the enforcement of private law rights, for
                    which private law and other court processes are readily
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">3.   Is the SGX-ST’s Reprimand
                susceptible to Judicial Review?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The foundations of Singapore law on judicial review are
                    the common law principles as they have developed in England
                    prior to the influence and impact of the European Union law,
                    the latter having no application to Singapore. Accordingly
                    it is necessary for this court to return to the pre-1972
                    bedrock judicial review principles, and to apply those
                    principles to the present case. In considering post-1972
                    judicial review decisions in England, care has to be taken
                    to extract only those common law principles where these
                    principles have not morphed into English law judicial review
                    principles as a result of European Union law, such as the
                    European Convention on Human Rights which was incorporated
                    into English law by the 1998 UK Human Rights Act. A similar
                    cautionary approach is warranted when considering judicial
                    review decisions by the Australian courts which have been
                    shaped by the Australian Administrative Decisions (Judicial
                    Review) Act 1977 which has no application to
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Michael Fordham, <em>Judicial Review
                        Handbook</em>, 2nd ed, 1997 (at
                    p 5) provides a useful bird’s eye
                    distillation of the court’s approach to judicial
                    review at pages 145, 148 and 172:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Judicial review is: the means by which High Court
                        judges scrutinise public law functions, intervening as a
                        matter of discretion, to quash, prevent, require,
                        clarify or compensate, not because they disagree with
                        the merits judgment, but so as to right a recognisable
                        public law wrong, whether, unlawfulness,
                        unreasonableness or unfairness. The applicant is a
                        person with sufficient interest, who lacks any suitable
                        alternative remedy, and who must commence proceedings
                        promptly.” “Judicial review is a
                        contextual, discretionary jurisdiction which is changing
                        dramatically and incrementally. (At
                        p. 145)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Courts promote their interventionist capacities,
                        driven by the rule of law and aversion to inconsistency
                        and abuse: Judicial review is the Courts’ way
                        of enforcing the rule of law: ensuring that public
                        decision-making is undertaken according to law and is
                        accountable to law. In other words, reminding public
                        bodies that they are not above the law. (At
                        p.148)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Courts adopt a primary deference, preserving for
                        public bodies a margin of responsibility and choice:
                        Public decision-makers exist for a purpose and there
                        must necessarily be questions which it are for them,
                        rather than judges, to decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Principles of judicial review are a Court-struck
                        balance, faithful to both vigilance and restraint: The
                        tension between vigilance and restraint is a main
                        undercurrent of judicial review, responsible for
                        producing the principles which govern the supervisory
                        jurisdiction. (At p.172)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The foundational common law principles in England have as
                    their starting point the source test (“Source
                    Test”), which was then extended by the nature
                    test (“Nature Test”) to take into
                    account the changing public governance landscape. The
                    development from the statutory Source Test where the court
                    looks to whether the body had its origins in statutes, to
                    the Nature Test where the court looks at the nature of the
                    decision, is discernable in the following sequence of the
                    seminal English judgments. In <em>Reg v
                        Criminal Injuries Compensation Board</em>,
                        <em>Ex parte Lain</em> [1967]
                    2 QB 864, <em>per</em> Lord Parker CJ at 882
                    where he describes the limits of the origins of certiorari,
                    (today the quashing order):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... They have varied from time to time being extended
                        to meet changing conditions. At one time the writ only
                        went to an inferior court. Later its ambit was extended
                        to statutory tribunals determining a <em>lis </em><em>inter
                            </em><em>partes</em>.
                        Later again it extended to cases where there was no
                            <em>lis</em> in the strict
                        sense of the word but where immediate or subsequent
                        rights of a citizen were affected. The only constant
                        limits throughout were that it was performing a public
                        duty. Private or domestic tribunals have always been
                        outside the scope of certiorari since their authority is
                        derived solely from contract, that is, from the
                        agreement of the parties concerned. ... We have, as it
                        seems to me reached the position when the ambit of
                        certiorari can be said to cover every case in which a
                        body of persons of a public as opposed to a purely
                        private or domestic character has to determine matters
                        affecting subjects provided always that it has a duty to
                        act judicially. Looked at in this way the board in my
                        judgment comes fairly and squarely within the
                        jurisdiction of this court...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At 884 to 885, Diplock LJ observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If new tribunals are established by acts of
                        government, the supervisory jurisdiction of the High
                        Court extends to them if they possess the essential
                        characteristics upon which the subjection of inferior
                        tribunal to the supervisory control of the High Court is
                        based. What are these characteristics? It is plain on
                        the authorities that the tribunal need not be one whose
                        determinations give rise directly to any legally
                        enforceable right or liability. Its determination may be
                        subject to certiorari notwithstanding that it is merely
                        one step in the process which may have the result of
                        altering the legal rights or liabilities of a person to
                        whom it relates...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In <em>Reg v Panel on Take-overs and
                        Mergers, ex parte </em><em>Datafin
                        plc And Another</em> [1987]
                    1 QB 815 (“<em>Datafin</em>”), Sir John
                    Donaldson MR described the same development in the
                    following manner at 838:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, in the
                        form which it then took, was an administrative novelty.
                        Accordingly it would have been impossible to find a
                        precedent for the exercise of the supervisory
                        jurisdiction of the court which fitted the facts.
                        Nevertheless the court not only asserted its
                        jurisdiction, but further asserted that it was a
                        jurisdiction which was adaptable thereafter. ...In all
                        the reports it is possible to find enumerations of
                        factors giving rise to the jurisdiction but it is a
                        fatal error to regard the presence of all those factors
                        as essential or as being exclusive of other factors.
                        Possibly the only essential elements are what can be
                        described as a public element, which can take many
                        forms, and the exclusion from the jurisdiction of bodies
                        whose <u>sole</u> source of
                        power is a consensual submission to its
                        jurisdiction...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the modern era, public policy is increasingly effected
                    not only by government and statutory bodies but also through
                    self-regulating entities in sectors where the domain nature
                    and complexity of the sector requires front- line expertise
                    coupled with back-line regulators to regulate the relevant
                    sector. The question arose in England in <em>Datafin</em>, with respect to the then newly
                    created London Panel on Take-overs which operated the City
                    Code on Take-overs and Mergers (“London
                    Panel”). The legal question there (and in this
                    application) was succinctly framed by Sir John
                    Donaldson in <em>Datafin</em>
                    at 828 in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whether the courts of this country have
                        any jurisdiction to control the activities of a body
                        which de facto exercises what can only be characterised
                        as powers in the nature of public law powers...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     While the London Panel “oversees and regulates
                    a very important function of the United Kingdom financial
                    market ... [it performs] this function without visible means
                    of legal support” (see <em>Datafin</em> at 824<em>)</em>. The court also noted that the London
                    Panel had no “statutory, prerogative or common
                    law powers and it is not in a contractual relationship with
                    the financial market or those who deal in that
                    market” (see <em>Datafin</em> at 825).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While lacking statutory authority, Sir John
                    Donaldson MR noted (at 826) that the
                    Panel:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sir John Donaldson MR was mindful that financial markets
                    required speed and certainty of decisions. He agreed with
                    the observation of Lord Diplock in <em>Reg v Inland Revenue Commissioners, Ex parte

                    to 643 that in the context of judicial review of
                    such decisions, the procedural need to apply for leave for
                    prerogative orders would:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... prevent the time of the court being wasted by
                        busybodies with misguided or trivial complaints of
                        administrative error, and to remove the uncertainty in
                        which public officers and authorities might be left as
                        to whether they could safely proceed with administrative
                        action while proceedings for judicial review of it were
                        actually pending even though misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In many cases of judicial review where the time scale
                        is far more extended than in the financial markets, the
                        decision-maker who learns that someone is seeking leave
                        to challenge his decision may well seek to preserve the
                        status quo meanwhile and, in particular, may not seek to
                        enforce the decision pending a consideration of the
                        matter by the court. If leave is granted, the court has
                        the necessary authority to make orders designed to
                        achieve this result, but usually the decision-maker will
                        give undertakings in lieu. All this is but good
                        administrative practice. However, against the background
                        of the time scales of the financial market, the courts
                        would not expect the panel or those who should comply
                        with its decisions to act similarly. In that context the
                        panel and those affected should treat its decisions as
                        valid and binding, unless and until they are set aside.
                        Above all they should ignore any application for leave
                        to apply of which they become aware, since to do
                        otherwise would enable such applications to be used as a
                        mere ploy in take-over battles which would be a serious
                        abuse of process of the court and could not be
                        adequately penalised by awards of costs. [p.840]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The observations of Lloyd LJ in <em>Datafin (at 847)</em> on the
                    spectrum between a statutory source and
                    contractual/consensual private decision-makers are also
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...If the source of the power is a statute, or
                        subordinate legislation under a statute, then clearly
                        the body in question will be subject to judicial review.
                        If, at the other end of the scale, the source of power
                        is contractual, as in the case of private arbitration,
                        then clearly the arbitrator is not subject to judicial
                        review: see <em>Reg. v National Joint
                            Council for the Craft of Dental

                        [1953] 1 QB 704.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But in between these extremes there is an area in
                        which it is helpful to look not just at the source of
                        the power but at the nature of the power. If the body in
                        question is exercising public law functions, or if the
                        exercise of its functions have public law consequences,
                        then that maybe sufficient to bring the body within the
                        reach of judicial review. It may be said that to refer
                        to “public law” in this context is
                        to beg the question. But I do not think it does. The
                        essential distinction, which runs through all the cases
                        to which we referred, is between a domestic or private
                        tribunal on the one hand and a body of persons who are
                        under some public duty on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     However, Lloyd LJ noted at 848 that to hold that
                    the Source Test was the sole test of whether a decision is
                    subject to judicial review would be to impose an artificial
                    limit on the developing law of judicial review. He concluded
                    that, quite apart from the Source Test, the court would also
                    apply the Nature Test. In the event that he was wrong and if
                    the only test applicable was the Source Test,
                    Lloyd LJ was prepared to consider that the London
                    Panel was established “under the authority of the
                    Government” such that it satisfied the Source
                    Test (at 849).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This process of development of the law of judicial review
                    is summarised in the following terms by <em>Judicial Remedies in Public Law</em>, Clive
                    Lewis QC (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2009)
                    at para 2-003:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the past, the courts focussed primarily on the
                        source of the power in determining whether a body was a
                        public one subject to judicial review. Now, however, the
                        modern approach is to consider whether the exercise of a
                        power, or performance of a duty involves a
                        “public element”, which can take
                        many different forms, and the exclusion from
                        jurisdiction of bodies whose <u>sole</u> source of power is a consensual
                        submission to its jurisdiction.” The source
                        of a power or duty remains an important indication of
                        the public law nature of a body or bodies created by
                        statute or acting under powers derived from the
                        prerogative will usually be public law bodies for the
                        purposes of judicial review. <em>Other
                            non-statutory bodies may, however, be performing
                            public law functions and may be subject to judicial
                            review in respect of those functions. Factors such
                            as the nature of the function, the extent to which
                            there is any statutory recognition or underpinning
                            of the body or the function in question and the
                            extent to which the body has been interwoven into a
                            system of governmental regulation may indicate that
                            the body performs public functions and is, in
                            principle, subject to judicial review in respect of
                            those function.</em> The principal exclusion
                        from the scope of judicial review now is bodies who
                        acquire jurisdiction over individuals by virtue of
                        contract. These are seen as private and not public
                        bodies.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The preceding account of the foundational common law

                    changing public governance landscapes. Only where the sole
                    source of a decision-maker’s power is contractual
                    or consensual would such decision-maker not be susceptible

                    particular regard to the interests of the investing public,

                    fair and transparent market is contingent on the timely and
                    accurate disclosure of material information. A review of
                    SGX-ST’s Listing Manual reveals a two-pronged

                    trading of listed securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first approach is to impose on the listed company the

                    7 contains Part II “Equity Securities-Immediate
                    Announcements” and Part III “Equity
                    Securities-Periodic Reports”. This corporate
                    disclosure obligation is underscored by the
                    Company’s Listing Undertaking issued to the SGX-ST
                    under authority of a board resolution. Where the listed

                    obligations, SGX-ST Listing Manual Chapter 13
                    provides for trading halts, suspension and delisting.
                    Rule 1302 enables the Exchange to grant a trading
                    halt to enable an issuer to disclose material information or
                    suspend trading at the request of the issuer. Suspension of
                    trading may be imposed by the Exchange where an issuer is
                    unable or unwilling to comply with or contravenes a listing
                    rule. Rule 1305 provides that the Exchange may delist an
                    issuer by removing an issuer from its Official List if it is
                    unable or unwilling to comply with, or contravenes a listing
                    rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second approach is consonant with developments in
                    other global stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock
                    Exchange: <em>i.e.</em> the SGX-ST has
                    introduced powers to publicly reprimand executive and
                    non-executive directors of listed companies for
                    non-compliance with the Listing Manual. The second approach
                    is expressed in SGX-ST’s Listing Manual,
                    Part IV “Equity Securities-Other
                    Obligations”. Rule 720(4), which was
                    introduced in 2011, provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the Exchange is of the opinion that a director
                        or key executive officer of an issuer has:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    wilfully contravened or wilfully caused the
                                issuer to breach the Listing Rues; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    wilfully contravened any relevant laws, rules
                                and regulations; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    refused to extend cooperation to the Exchange
                                or other regulatory agencies in an investigation
                                of wrongdoing related to the issuer such that
                                doubts are cast on the directors’
                                ability to discharge their duties as
                                directors,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Exchange may take the necessary actions including
                        but not limited to:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Publishing the names of the individual directors or
                        key executive officers with relevant information about
                        the contravention or failure to extend cooperation;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Objecting to appointments of the individual directors

<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed that Rule 720 has been
                    properly enacted and approved by the MAS in accordance with

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Nature of reprimand function</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A public reprimand of directors of a listed company by the
                    SGX-ST, a front-line securities regulator, carries financial
                    and business implications. Some of the possible implications
                    may be gleaned from Lord Denning’s observations in
                        <em>Re Pergamon Press Ltd</em>
                    [1970] 3 All ER 535
                        (“<em>Re Pergamon
                        Press</em>”) in relation to
                    inspectors’ reports issued by inspectors under the
                    English Companies Act. While such inspectors only have
                    powers to ‘investigate and report’, they
                    may,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if they think fit, make findings of fact
                        which are very damaging to those whom they name. They
                        may accuse some; they may condemn others; they may ruin
                        reputations or careers. Their report may lead to
                        judicial proceedings. It may expose persons to criminal
                        prosecutions or to civil actions. It may bring about the
                        winding-up of the company...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Re Pergamon Press</em>, the
                    English Court of Appeal considered and held that such
                    inspectors were bound by the principles of natural justice.
                    The English Court of Appeal then set a limited scope of fair
                    hearing as being appropriate to the inspectors’
                    function: before the inspectors could condemn or criticise a
                    person, they must give the person a fair opportunity for
                    correcting or contradicting what was said again him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     What then are the potential implications of a SGX-ST
                    public reprimand of a listed company’s directors?
                    SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of
                    Singapore’s financial sector. It operates an open
                    and international securities market within the 24/7 global
                    network of securities markets. SGX-ST’s public
                    reprimand of a listed company’s directors
                    accordingly may potentially impact a director domestically
                    and internationally in several ways, depending on his
                    background. These include: adverse business reputational
                    implications, implications on their continued service on
                    board committees and directorships of other listed companies
                    and other professional and financial services licence
                    implications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the light of the above, the legislative and regulatory
                    matrix of the Singapore securities market, the statutory
                    underpinning of the reprimand power and the nature of the
                    reprimand function, the reprimand power would, in my view,
                    properly be characterised as a public function within the
                    Nature Test and consequently susceptible to judicial review
                    for minimum compliance with the standards of
                    “legality, rationality and procedural
                    propriety”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">4.   What is the scope of duty to act
                fairly?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The common law prescribes minimum standards of procedural
                    propriety by requiring a fair hearing and the absence of
                    bias. There is no one-size-fits-all template for a fair
                    hearing. What constitutes a fair hearing depends on the
                    nature and context of the decision. What then constitutes a
                    fair hearing, when directors fail to comply with the
                    relevant exchange listing rules to disclose material
                    information, in the context of the securities market where
                    the timely and accurate disclosure of material information
                    is critical?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I find considerable guidance from
                    Lord Mustill’s elaboration of the
                    relevant factors, which are equally applicable regardless of
                    whether the Source Test or the Nature Test is applicable.
                        <em>R v. Secretary of State for the Home
                        Department, ex parte </em><em>Doody</em> [1994] 1 AC 531
                    at 560 D-G:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What does fairness require in the present case? My
                        Lords, I think it unnecessary to refer by name or to
                        quote from, any of the oft-cited authorities in which
                        the courts have explained what is essentially an
                        intuitive judgment. They are far too well known. From
                        them, I derive that (1) where an Act of
                        Parliament confers an administrative power there is a
                        presumption that it will be exercised in a manner which
                        is fair in all the circumstances. (2) the
                        standards are not immutable. They may change with the
                        passage of time, both in general and in their
                        application to decisions of a particular type.
                        (3) The principles of fairness are not to be
                        applied by rote identically in every situation. What
                        fairness demands is dependent on the context of the
                        decision, and this is to be taken into account in all
                        its aspects. (4) An essential feature of the
                        context is the statute which creates the discretion, as
                        regards both its language and the shape of the legal and
                        administrative system within which the decision is
                        taken. (5) Fairness will very often require
                        that a person who may be adversely affected by the
                        decision will have an opportunity to make
                        representations on his own behalf either before the
                        decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable
                        result; or after it is taken, with a view to procuring
                        its modification; of both. (6) Since the person
                        affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations
                        without knowing what factors may weigh against his
                        interests fairness will very often require that he is
                        informed of the gist of the case which he has to
                        answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In short, fairness, in the context of disclosure of
                    information in the securities market, requires that the
                    person affected is informed of the case against him and that
                    he has an opportunity to make representations before the
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The unfolding chronology of events leading up to
                the SGX-ST Reprimand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is the applicant’s case that the SGX-ST did
                    not accord him with a fair hearing in that:
                    (i) SGX-ST had not given him any notice or
                    information that they were considering or intending to
                    impose a sanction on him and (ii) SGX-ST should
                    have informed him of the case against him and given him a
                    right to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I next turn to set out the chronology of events leading to

                    China Sky on 16 December 2011, in order to evaluate
                    whether the applicant had been given notice that SGX-ST
                    intended to reprimand him, whether he was notified of the
                    case against him and whether he had an opportunity to make
                    representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     China Sky is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

                    Annual Report 2010 (“the AR 2010”).
                    The SGX-ST reviewed the AR 2010, and having noticed several
                    discrepancies, queried the Company on 19 April 2011

                        was RMB 1.5 million (S$300,000) and for the
                        financial year 2010 was RMB 866,000 (S$173,000). The AR

                        decided to defer its expansion and completion of the
                        land acquisition in light of the global financial crisis

                    a period of six months, the SGX-ST sent repeated
                    email requests for information, clarification and production
                    of documents to China Sky’s CFO, many of which
                    were copied to the CEO and to all the Audit Committee
                    members. The CFO repeatedly replied assuring SGX-ST that the

                    to arrange for the CEO and the Audit Committee members to
                    meet SGX-ST’s officers to discuss the matter
                    face-to-face. Notwithstanding these assurances, no documents
                    relating to the Land Discrepancy were provided to the
                    SGX-ST.</p>

                    a letter from the CEO. This email was copied to the
                    applicant and the CFO. The CEO requested an appointment to
                    meet the SGX-ST officers in the letter, and added the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Furthermore, your request has raised some

                            We nevertheless want to remain engaged to meet your
                            expressed concerns and in this regard, we request
                            you identify clearly to us the relevance of the

                            issues are phrased may, we suggest, give the
                            impression to shareholder and the investing public
                            that the Company and its management is being
                            investigated for unidentified wrongdoings. We trust
                            that you would agree such an impression is both
                            inaccurate and unhealthy for the Company’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 1 July 2011 China Sky issued an announcement
                    to the effect that the land acquisition agreement, the
                    subject of the SGX-ST’s Land Discrepancy queries,
                    had been rescinded and RMB 263 million would be
                    repaid. It is noteworthy that the amount of RMB 263million
                    matches the total of the RMB 149 million land cost
                    and RMB 114 million construction cost previously
                    announced.</p>

                    SGX-ST officers. On 11 August 2011 the SGX sent an
                    email at 3.05 pm to the CFO, copied to management and all
                    the Audit Committee members, stating <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Company has not cooperated with us and has

                        the Exchange’s queries. Therefore we are of
                        the view that unless the Company is able to show that it
                        is willing to comply with our rules and requests, it
                        will not be fruitful to have further meetings on these
                        same points repeatedly. Unless the Company submits all
                        the required documents before the meeting and shows its
                        sincerity in complying with our rules, convening more
                        meetings at short notices would not be fruitful.</p>

                        the interested person transactions conducted with its
                        independent director. As the investigations will also
                        involve the transactions with the Company’s AC

                            and its Audit Committee (“AC”)
                            Chairman, Lai Seng Kwoon, the aborted acquisition
                            and development of land in China and certain repairs
                            and maintenance costs (collectively, the
                            “Special Audit Issues”). The
                            company made contradictory statements and
                            disclosures which were not substantiated when
                            queried by the Exchange. Coupled with the unusual
                            nature of the transactions and having regard to all
                            the circumstances, the Exchange considered the
                            interest of the Company’s shareholders and
                            the investing public would be best served with the
                            appointment of a Special Auditor to investigate the
                            Special Audit Issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On 16 November 2011, pursuant to Listing
                            Rule 704(14), the Exchange issued the
                            Directive. The appointment and terms of reference
                            for the Special Auditor were to be carried out in
                            consultation with the Exchange. As is the practice,
                            the Special Auditor was to report to the independent
                            members of the Audit Committee and the
                            Exchange.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    On 17 November 2011, the Board of
                            Directors (the “Board”)
                            requested a trading suspension of the
                            Company’s shares on its own accord and
                            announced the Directive. It further stated that the
                            Board would be meeting on an urgent basis to
                            consider the Directive and “to make the
                            necessary announcements as
                            needed.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    On 22 November 2011, the Board announced
                            that it would “be seeking legal and
                            professional advice to respond to this directive
                            from SGX. The Board’s primary
                            responsibility is to protect and preserve the value
                            of all stakeholders. It will work expeditiously to
                            resume trading of its shares upon receipt of
                            appropriate legal and professional advice.
                            Appropriate announcements will be made as and when
                            they are available.” ON the same day, the
                            Exchange asked the Board to provide timelines for
                            its appointment of its legal and professional
                            advisors and for the appointment of a Special
                            Auditor. On 30 November 2011, the Company
                            announced its appointment of a legal advisor but did
                            not inform the Exchange nor disclose when it would
                            comply with the appointment of the Special
                            Auditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The Company failed to appoint a Special Auditor
                            even though sufficient time was accorded. This was
                            despite the Board’s representation that it
                            will work expeditiously to comply with the
                            Directive. Further delay was unacceptable. On
                            6 December 2011, the Exchange gave a
                            deadline of 8 December 2011 for the Company
                            to comply with the Directive. The Company failed to
                            do so. Instead the Company wrote three letters to
                            the Exchange. The letters made clear that the
                            Company continued to refuse to comply with the
                            directive for the appointment of the Special
                            Auditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The Exchange takes a serious view of the
                            Board’s disregard of the Directive. The
                            Exchange had given the Board numerous opportunities
                            to respond to the Special Audit Issues and had
                            carefully considered the responses. The Directive is
                            made in the interest of the shareholders, and is
                            taken only after careful and deliberate
                            consideration. The Special Audit Report will provide
                            clarity on the matters to be investigated. The
                            Exchange’s concern is heightened when the
                            Company not only failed to appoint the Special
                            Auditor but instead aggressively resisted the
                            Directive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    The Exchange reiterates that it will continue to
                            communicate directly with any officer of any listed
                            company. The Exchange will not allow any issuer to
                            dictate how it regulates listed companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The Exchange reprimands the Company, and each and
                            every one of the Board, namely Cheung Wing Lin,

                            Seng Kwoon, Er Kwong Wah and Yeap Wai Kong for their
                            flagrant disregard of the Directive and for their
                            non-compliance with the Directive in breach of
                            Listing Rule 704(14).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    It is in the interest of the Company and its
                            shareholders for the Special Audit to be carried out
                            immediately and the trading suspension lifted. The
                            continued suspension of trading in the
                            Company’s shares is not in the interest of
                            shareholders.</p>

                            Reprimand was unwarranted, issued without any merit
                            and clearly showed a total disregard of the interest

                            Board to seek clarification from the SGX before
                            appointing the Special Auditor as they noted that

                            interest in that, among other things, the
                            appointment will cause the Company to incur
                            substantial costs, will cause unnecessary

                            adverse economic condition and will interfere with

                    issued a response to the SGX-ST Reprimand Annexure. In
                    short, its position was that with respect to the IPT and
                    Land Discrepancies, adequate disclosure had been made
                    following the announced responses to SGX’s
                    queries. Further:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    The Company notes that whilst the SGX has regarded
                            the transactions described in the Annexure as
                            unusual, there have been no express allegations of
                            accounting irregularities or fraudulent practices.
                            In short, the usual reasons giving rise to concerns
                            necessitating the appointment of Special Auditors
                            for companies listed on the SGX are clearly absent.
                            Accordingly we maintain that an appointment of
                            Special Auditors would be unwarranted and clearly
                            not in the best interest of the Company and its

                    9 January 2012 to the Chairman and CEO of the
                    SGX-ST copied to the Chairman and CEO of the MAS setting out
                    his complaint and requested an apology for the reprimand. He
                    received an interim and then a fuller reply from the SGX-ST
                    which did not accede to his request for an apology. In
                    February 2012 the applicant sought leave under
                    O 53 ROC for a quashing order to quash the SGX-ST
                    Reprimand on grounds of a breach of natural justice and was
                    granted leave for this hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">5.   Was the applicant accorded a fair hearing
                prior to the SGX Reprimand?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The issue turns on whether the applicant was given notice
                    that the SGX-ST was intending to reprimand him, the case
                    against him and whether he was accorded an opportunity to
                    make representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     From 16 May 2011 to 23 August 2011, the
                    SGX-ST sent repeated emails to China Sky’s CFO,
                    all copied to the applicant as an Audit Committee member,
                    raising queries on the IPT and Land Discrepancies
                    announcements which only raised further questions. For
                    3 months, the directors approved the
                    Company’s announcements containing corrections of
                    earlier announcements which raised more queries. The failure
                    to make the required disclosures resulted in the SGX-ST
                    Board Show Cause Letter of 23 August 2011 which was
                    addressed to the Board of Directors, emailed to the
                    applicant and received by all the directors. The letter
                    which was entitled “CHINA SKY CHEMICAL FIBRE CO.
                    LTD (THE “COMPANY”) LISTING RULE
                    BREACHES, meticulously pinpointed the particular Company
                    announcements and set out the non-disclosures and misleading
                    disclosures against the specific Listing Manual Rules that
                    had been breached and concluded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the foregoing, the Exchange intends to
                        issue a public reprimand and reserves the right to take
                        any further action as necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please show cause why relevant disciplinary actions
                        should not be taken against the Company for the above
                        breaches. Please respond to this letter by
                        30 August 2011.If we do not hear from you by
                        the stipulated date, the Exchange will decide on the
                        appropriate actions to take, without further reference
                        to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It is clear from the foregoing that the applicant had been
                    provided with full particulars of the breaches of the
                    Listing Manual and with notice that SGX-ST intended to
                    publicly reprimand and reserved the right to take further
                    action. The applicant’s counsel submitted that as
                    this letter was addressed to the Company, it was not
                    addressed to the applicant as an individual director. It is
                    beyond dispute that the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter,
                    which is expressly addressed to the Board of Directors, is
                    necessarily meant to and does include every director. It was
                    received by every director. The submission in this factual
                    context, that the show cause letter addressed to and
                    received by the Board of Directors does not put the
                    individual directors on notice of an intended reprimand and
                    the case against each of them carries no weight. It is
                    further on record that the Board of Directors took legal
                    advice on this letter (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is clear from para 3 of the SGX-ST Board Show
                    Cause Letter that the SGX-ST intended to issue a public
                    reprimand. The only relevant provision of the Listing Manual
                    relating to a public reprimand is Rule 720 and
                    relates only to directors of listed companies, and not the
                    companies themselves. In short, all the directors were given
                    unequivocal notice that SGX-ST intended to publicly
                    reprimand them. They were all also given full particulars of
                    the case against them. They were given opportunity to
                    provide documents required under the Documents Directive of
                    6 November 2011 and finally to appoint a special
                    auditor to review and report on the same continuing
                    non-disclosures by the Special Auditor Directive of
                    16 November 2011. The SGX-ST Reprimand of
                    16 December 2011 came only after a lapse of six
                    months of continuing non-disclosures, non-compliance with
                    consequential Directives and directors’ approved
                    Company announcements signifying a refusal to make or
                    procure accurate material disclosures as repeatedly
                    requested by SGX-ST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     During these six months, the Board of Directors, the CEO
                    and CFO and all the Audit Committee members, including the
                    applicant, were in direct communication with the SGX-ST on
                    these matters and had full opportunity to explain or make
                    representations, if they so wished. Quite apart from China
                    Sky’s original lawyers, the Company had appointed
                    Asia Ascent to advise them on the Special Auditor Directive.
                    The Company’s letter to the SGX-ST on
                    24 August 2011 in response to the SGX-ST Board Show
                    Cause Letter expressly invoked their rights to
                    “natural justice and due process” (see
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). If any
                    individual director wished to put his personal
                    representation upon receipt of the SGX-ST Board Show Cause
                    Letter of 23 August 2011, which was at variance
                    with their subsequent directors’ approved Company
                    announcements and communications to SGX-ST, he had full
                    opportunity to do so. There is nothing on record to show
                    that any of the directors saw any need to procure the
                    announcement of the material information set out in
                    SGX-ST’s Board Show Cause Letter, nor comply with
                    the subsequent Directives whose objectives were to provide
                    independent verification of the same material information.
                    Instead, during this period, the directors approved China
                    Sky announcements and communications, which <em>ex facie</em> repeatedly and
                    unequivocally refused to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Since an orderly transparent securities market is
                    contingent on the timely and accurate disclosure of material
                    corporate information, the lapse of time from May 2011 to
                    December 2011 during which no disclosure was made as
                    requested by the SGX-ST, despite the full knowledge and
                    approval of all the directors, is troubling. The Document
                    Directive, and later the Special Auditor Directive were both
                    the consequence of the continuing failure to provide
                    accurate material disclosure of the IPT and Land
                    Discrepancies raised by the China Sky AR 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The applicant next argues that he personally had not been
                    accorded a fair hearing on two grounds. Firstly that the
                    original show cause letter of 23 August 2011 was
                    addressed only to the Board of Directors. The succeeding
                    Document Directive of 2 November 2011 was similarly
                    addressed to the Board of Directors. The Special Auditor
                    Directive of 16 November 2011 was addressed to the
                    Board of Directives and additionally
                    “Attention-ed” to the individually
                    named directors but inexplicably omitted the applicant by
                    name. The applicant was a recipient of all these operative
                    SGX-ST emails letters and Directives. Nothing turns on the
                    omission of his name from the Special Auditor Directive. The
                    applicant cannot deny that the SGX-ST Board Show Cause
                    Letter and the Directives were addressed to the Board of
                    Directors of which he is a member or that they put him on
                    notice of their contents. The applicant’s final
                    argument that SGX-ST ought to have issued him additionally
                    with a personal show cause letter is without merit as he had
                    received the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter and Directives,
                    all of which were all addressed to and received by him as a
                    board member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The applicant is aggrieved that he was reprimanded by the
                    SGX-ST. He joined the China Sky board and Audit Committee
                    shortly after the SGX-ST queried China Sky’s AR
                    2010. He actively engaged in attempting to arrange for the
                    CEO and CFO to meet the SGX-ST officers to resolve the
                    problems. Even after the Special Auditor Directive he is
                    recorded in the minutes of the board meeting of
                    19 November 2011 of having urged the company to
                    comply with the Special Auditor Directive. His well-meaning
                    efforts at urging compliance and arranging meetings appear
                    to have distracted him from fully appreciating the
                    significance of the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter and the
                    subsequent Directives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">6.   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The SGX-ST fully and substantively accorded the applicant
                    a fair hearing by having given him notice of its intention
                    to reprimand, particulars of the case against him and full
                    opportunities between August to December 2011 to be
                    heard.</p>
