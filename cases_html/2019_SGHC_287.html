These key terms include the quantity of coal, the type of vessel, the laycan, the loading port, the loading rate, the quality of coal, the price, a price adjustment formula, the time of payment and the demurrage. The plaintiff’s proposal does not nominate the independent surveyor but instead indicates expressly that the independent surveyor is to be agreed.

</div> without even agreeing a method for doing so. But the plaintiff argues that this omission does not render their contract unenforceable for uncertainty. Instead, the fact that the parties did not agree on a particular method means that any method would be acceptable. The parties reached agreement on the load port surveyor soon after 29 March 2017,

Although the defendant proposed several changes to the draft contract, at no point did the defendant make any comment on, let alone propose any change to, cll 7 and 8.

Therefore, the identity of the surveyor was in reality never a contentious point in any of the dealings between the parties. The failure to agree on the surveyor’s identity in the business confirmation emails did not prevent those emails from giving rise to a concluded contract.

</div> If the business confirmation emails are found to give rise to a concluded contract, the parties’ previous course of dealings establishes a common understanding or assumption that any agreement which the parties reached would not bind them unless they went on to execute a formal contract recording the terms of that agreement in writing. That common understanding or assumption raises an estoppel by convention against the plaintiff which precludes it from now asserting that the business confirmation emails in themselves gave rise to a concluded contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The central issue in this action is therefore whether the business confirmation emails gave rise to a concluded contract.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 My findings, in summary, are as follows. I find that the business confirmation emails did give rise to a concluded contract. The emails contain all the necessary elements for contract formation, in particular intention to create legal relations and certainty of terms. I also find that there was no convention between the parties to support an estoppel by convention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This action engages well established principles on contract formation. I summarise below the three principles which are relevant to this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 First, the law adopts an objective approach to questions of contractual formation. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">R1 International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG </span>[2015] 1 SLR 521 (“<span class="font-italic">R1 International</span>”) at [51], this involves the court:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…ascertaining the parties’ objective intentions gleaned from their correspondence and conduct in light of the relevant background as disclosed by the evidence. The relevant background includes the industry in which the parties are in, the character of the document which contains the terms in question as well as the course of dealings between the parties ….</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, an offeree can accept an offer in any manner that is a “final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer”: Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel on T</span><span class="font-italic">he Law of Contract </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Treitel</span>”) at para 2-016. An offeree can accept by words or by conduct, so long as the words or conduct satisfy this test. Negative conduct, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a failure or omission to speak or to act, can amount to acceptance: <span class="font-italic">Midlink Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [50]. But it must be said that silence, in itself, is often equivocal and therefore will not in general easily lead to the inference that the offeree is thereby expressing “final and unqualified … assent”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 One situation where it is easier to infer acceptance from silence is where the parties discuss and agree a set of terms which are sufficiently certain to give rise to a concluded contract, but leave the remaining terms of their contract for future discussion and agreement. It is not always necessary to analyse the contractual effect of those additional terms by applying the usual rules of offer and acceptance. When a party proposes <span class="font-italic">additional</span> terms to a counterparty in this situation and the counterparty remains silent, it is easier to infer that the counterparty has accepted the additional terms so as to be contractually bound by them. In particular, a counterparty’s silence may justify an inference of acceptance: (i) if the party expressly asks the counterparty for objections when proposing the additional terms (<span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">1 International</span> at [55]); or (ii) if the additional terms are common in a given market (<span class="font-italic">R1 International</span> at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For the former proposition, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">RI International</span> cited the following passage from the decision of Aikens J in <span class="font-italic">Statoil ASA </span><span class="font-italic">v Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP </span>[2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 1035 (“<span class="font-italic">Statoil</span>”) at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the principal terms have been agreed and the parties are, to use Bingham J’s phrase in [<span class="font-italic">Pagnan </span><span class="font-italic">SpA v Feed Products Ltd </span>[1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 601] ‘sorting out details against the background of a concluded contract’, then the strict requirements of positive offer and positive acceptance are not necessarily appropriate. <span class="font-italic">If one party makes a proposal for terms and the other does not object to it when asked if it has objections, that can, in appropriate circumstances, be taken as acceptance of that term</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Third, the parties may intend to be contractually bound – even after they have agreed all or some of the terms of their contract – only when a final and further condition is fulfilled. This further condition could be the execution of a formal contract recording their agreement in writing. Or it could be the parties’ agreement on a particular term not yet agreed. By the same token, the parties may intend to be contractually bound as soon as they reach agreement on a set of terms even though they go on to discuss and negotiate additional terms (<span class="font-italic">R1 International </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The authority for this third principle is <span class="font-italic">Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd </span>[1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span>”) at 619, cited in <span class="font-italic">R1 International </span>at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Even if the parties have reached agreement on all the terms of the proposed contract, nevertheless they may intend that the contract shall not become binding until some further condition has been fulfilled. That is the ordinary ‘subject to contract’ case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Alternatively, they may intend that the contract shall not become binding until some further term or terms have been agreed; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) <span class="font-italic">Conversely, the parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be fulfilled</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>… .</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) <span class="font-italic">If the parties fail to reach agreement on such further terms, the existing contract is not invalidated</span> unless the failure to reach agreement on such further terms renders the contract as a whole unworkable or void for uncertainty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span> expressly envisages that the parties may be contractually bound when they have reached agreement only on a subset of their contractual terms. That subset of terms is usually called the “essential” terms. The question then arises how to define what are the essential terms in any given case. As Lloyd LJ (as he then was) said in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span> (at 619): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) It is sometimes said that the parties must agree on the essential terms and that it is only matters of detail which can be left over. This may be misleading, since the word ‘essential’ in that context is ambiguous. <span class="font-italic">If by ‘essential’ one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract.</span> If by ‘essential’ one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. <span class="font-italic">If by ‘essential’ one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. </span><span class="font-italic">It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge, ‘the masters of their contractual fate’. Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In endorsing this passage in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span>, Andrew Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals Pte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1023 (“<span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span>”) remarked (at [27]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… whether or not a term is objectively important is a different question from whether the parties intended to be bound. It is not for the court to decide which terms are important such that parties must agree on those terms before any binding contract can be concluded. Rather, it is for the parties to decide whether and when they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The third principle is subject to two caveats. The first, of course, is that the inquiry into the subset of terms which must be agreed for the parties to have concluded a contract does not look into the parties’ subjective intention or into their subjective desire to manifest or withhold assent to being contractually bound when that subset is agreed. The question is whether the parties, by their words and conduct, have demonstrated objectively that they intend to be bound <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the terms which remain to be agreed: <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [27]. The second caveat is that all of this is subject to the requirement of contractual certainty. To put it another way, the parties cannot contract out of the requirement imposed by the law of contract that the parties’ agreement must be sufficiently certain to constitute a contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I now apply these principles to the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the reasons which follow, I find that the parties’ communications and conduct in and after the business confirmation emails manifest four objective indicators that the emails set out a concluded bargain binding on both parties, even if further terms remained to be agreed and even if a formal contract was never executed to record the terms of their agreement in writing. I find also that the parties’ failure to agree on the identity of the load port surveyor as at 29 March 2017 is not fatal to a concluded contract arising on that date. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intention to create legal relations</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties reached a concluded contract on 29 March 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Language of offer and acceptance</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The first of the four indicators of an intention to create legal relations is a striking feature of the business confirmation emails of 29 March 2017, patent to any objective observer. It is the parties’ express use of the language of offer and acceptance.

</div>
</div> These words are not, of course, determinative in and of themselves either as terms of legal art or even merely as semantic labels. But the words are a good objective indication that the parties saw themselves as engaged in a process intended to produce a consensus <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> in order to conclude a commercial bargain between them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I have reproduced the contents of the emails, so far as relevant, at [7]–[13] above. Mr Zhou begins the exchange in the first email by making an explicit “offer” to Mr Wei. He informs Mr Wei that the plaintiff was “pleased to offer [the defendant] the following coal” (see [9]). He then sets out a number of details in relation to the offer: price, quantity, laycan, loading rate and the quality and specifications of the coal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Although the first email is phrased as an unqualified offer, intended to elicit the defendant’s unqualified assent, the defendant withheld that assent. Instead, the defendant responded with a counter offer. The classical Victorian paradigm of contract formation is, after all, rooted in reality. Thus, in the second email, Mr Wei responds within three hours to counter offer a lower price per metric tonne for the different types of vessel and to counter offer a longer timeline for the defendant to open a letter of credit (see [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The third email from Mr Zhou to Mr Wei is important for two reasons. First, Mr Zhou confirms that the plaintiff “<span class="font-italic">accept[</span><span class="font-italic">s]</span>” the defendant’s price of US$40.20/MT of coal for gearless vessels. Second, Mr Zhou counter counter offers US$39.10 per metric tonne as the plaintiff’s “best price” for geared and grabbed vessels. Mr Zhou goes on to add, “[please] kindly <span class="font-italic">accept</span> <span class="font-italic">and confirm</span>” [emphasis added] (see [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the fourth and final email, Mr Wei states simply: “<span class="font-italic">[c]onfirm your good offer as below</span>” [emphasis added] (see [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The defendant does not and cannot deny what is plain: the parties were using the language of offer and acceptance. The consistent refrain of “offer”, “acceptance” and “confirmation” is an objective indicator that parties were searching for a consensus <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> in order to conclude a commercial bargain between them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Agreed terms never renegotiated</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, it is telling that all of the terms agreed between the parties in the offer and acceptance set out in the business confirmation emails were incorporated faithfully into the first draft of the contract which the plaintiff presented to the defendant on 29 March 2017 (see [16] above). Further, they were never again the subject of discussion throughout the parties’ negotiations right until the plaintiff sent the final draft of the contract to the defendant for execution on 18 April 2017. The draft contract even incorporated terms from the defendant’s counter offer in the second email (see [11]). Thus, cl 11 of the draft contract records the defendant’s counter offer that the letter of credit “must be fully operational ultimately on or before 5 days prior to vessel arrival at loading port”.

The statement of principle in the fourth numbered proposition in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span> (<span class="font-italic">supra </span>[55]) encapsulates this situation perfectly: parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Final draft of the contract is dated 29 March 2017</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The third indicator is that the final draft of the contract which the plaintiff executed and sent to the defendant on 18 April 2017 is not dated 18 April 2017 but is instead dated 29 March 2017. It begins with “[t]his Agreement no. AC17S069 is made the <span class="font-italic">29</span><span class="font-italic">th day of March 2017</span> by and between” the plaintiff and the defendant. 29 March 2017 is, of course, the date of the business confirmation emails. The defendant never objected to or even commented on this aspect of the draft contract. This is again an objective indicator that the parties saw their conduct on 29 March 2017 as conduct intended to create legal relations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The three previous dealings between the parties (see [35] above) followed the same pattern. All of the dealings produced a draft contract which bears the date of the business confirmation emails preceding it.

In that email, Mr Wei explains that the defendant hopes to purchase only one out of the three cargoes from the plaintiff and to cancel the remainder because of weak domestic demand for coal. Mr Wei’s explanation does not refer to any alleged lack of intention to create legal relations when they exchanged the business confirmation emails and does not adopt the position of a party entitled to disregard the offer and acceptance recorded in the business confirmation emails. He adopts instead the position of a supplicant, hoping to be permitted to resile from a commitment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… For the three cargoes, <span class="font-italic">as the results of market downward, domestic demand of thermal coal is very weak, domestic price and internal price of thermal coal are both going down dramatically</span>, therefore, we hope to carry out only one cargo of 55000t, and cancel other two cargoes. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Implicit in Mr Wei’s email, and in particular from his precatory words to the plaintiff about the other two cargoes, is that Mr Wei accepts that the parties did intend to create legal relations when they exchanged the business confirmation emails, and that the defendant is contractually bound to purchase all three cargoes from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendant seeks to downplay this email. It alleges that the real reason it sought to take only one out of the three cargoes was not weak domestic demand for coal but a market rumour about “ongoing issues relating to the quality of [the defendant’s] cargoes”.

</div> A clause like this is commonly called a “subject to contract” or “subject to execution” clause. Lloyd LJ (as he then was) expressly adverted to this in numbered paragraph 2 in the extract from <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span> (cited at [55] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Benourad</span> is wholly distinguishable. In <span class="font-italic">Benourad</span>, the claimant and the defendant were negotiating the terms on which the defendant would pay the claimant a commission for introducing the defendant to a joint venture partner (at [32]). The claimant emailed the defendant a draft contract. There were three indicators in the draft contract that the parties envisaged their agreement to be subject to a condition that the parties execute a written contract recording the terms of their agreement. First, the claimant asked the defendant to initial the draft and send it back to him for signature (at [36]). Second, the draft provided in cl 1 that the “… agreement will be effective… for…a period of 36 months starting from the signature of the present agreement”. Finally, cl 9 was an entire agreement clause excluding any prior oral agreement (at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defendant emailed the plaintiff a month later with its comments on the draft contract. The defendant sought to alter the identity of the counterparty to the contract and to alter the triggering event upon which the claimant would be paid his commission. The defendant asked the claimant to “confirm [his] agreement” to the new basis so they could “draft a document accordingly” (at [49]). The claimant did not agree to the defendant’s changes (at [50]). He sued for his commission based either on an oral agreement reached in the course of the negotiations or on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The draft contract in <span class="font-italic">Benourad</span> did not contain a “subject to contract” clause. Nevertheless, Beatson J (as he then was) was prepared to draw the inference that the parties had no intention to create legal relations until they signed a formal contract simply from the parties’ references to “signatures” and “documents” in the parties’ email communications as well as in the draft contract itself (at [109]):

But the terms of the draft document itself provide a strong indication that any agreement did not bind until it was signed. So, the provision in clause 1 is that “the agreement will be effective… for a period of 36 months starting from the signature of the present agreement”, and there is an entire agreement provision in clause 9. These tend to show that it was the intention of the parties that unless the document was executed any oral agreement did not bind.</span> [emphasis added by the defendant]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant relies strongly on Beatson J’s observations in this passage and urges me to adopt the same approach. But the defendant has taken Beatson J’s observations out of context. The first point to note is that what Beatson J said at [109] of <span class="font-italic">Benourad</span> is <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. Beatson J had by then already found that there was no oral agreement because the parties were never <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> on the critical issue of the triggering event for the claimant’s commission. It was therefore unnecessary for him to determine whether parties’ intention to create legal relations was subject to a condition that they execute a formal contract. He went on to consider the issue only because the point had been fully argued before him (at [105]). Second, Beatson J himself acknowledged (at [109]) that the parties’ references to signing a written document were “not conclusive”. That was only one of the facts he had regard to in a fact-sensitive exercise (at [111]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, had an oral agreement been reached…on the broad lines of the [the plaintiff’s draft contract], I would have concluded that, <span class="font-italic">in the light of the exchanges and the negotiations about the identity of the parties and the basis of remuneration and the request for the draft to be signed</span>, there was no intention to be bound unless a written agreement was concluded and executed. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">Benourad</span> does not detract from the general principle that whether the parties have an intention to create legal relations must depend on the totality of the facts and circumstances in each case. Those circumstances <span class="font-italic">includ</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> a subject to contract clause if there is one. But its presence is not conclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the present case, the subject to contract clause in cl 26 of the draft contract was never an aspect of the parties’ negotiations on 29 March 2017. Subject only to what I say at [86] to [90] below about the parties’ previous course of dealings, the subject to contract clause came into play only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the parties exchanged the business confirmation emails, when the plaintiff sent the draft contract to the defendant in order to initiate the negotiations over those more detailed terms. The business confirmation emails themselves give no indication at all that any agreement reached in them will be subject to the parties executing a formal contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I also reject the defendant’s submission that the parties’ negotiations after the business confirmation emails on the other terms in the draft contract and the plaintiff’s insistence as late as May 2017 that the defendant execute the contract indicate that the parties intended their agreement to be binding only when a formal contract had been executed.

It is true that Andrew Ang J notes here that the “substantial amendments” to the draft contract undermined the plaintiff’s case that the written contract was <br/>“merely a formality”. But that was not sufficient to displace his finding that parties <span class="font-italic">did</span> intend their agreement to be binding while leaving detailed terms to be negotiated (see <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span> at [21]). Ang J also took the view that the plaintiff’s insistence on getting the contract executed did <span class="font-italic">not</span> lead to a clear inference that it did not intend to create any legal relations until that happened. In his view, it was equally likely that the plaintiff’s actions in insisting on getting the draft contract executed was consistent with the plaintiff simply ensuring that all details were administratively finalised before the time of first shipment, rather than evincing awareness that there was yet no concluded contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In any case, I have found that the parties’ conduct on 29 March 2017 evinced an intention to create legal relations on that day, even though there were further details to be negotiated and agreed.

On the plaintiff’s side, it failed to render performance of the transaction contemplated by the 2015 dealing and made no excuse for its failure. That behaviour can be explained only on the basis that the plaintiff did not intend the business confirmation emails in 2015 to create legal relations. Otherwise, the plaintiff had no legal basis for refusing to sign the draft contract and for failing perform the 2015 dealing.

Given my finding that it can be objectively ascertained from the contemporaneous documents that the parties intended to create legal relations by the business confirmation emails of 29 March 2017, it is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion on the true nature of the 2015 dealing. It suffices to say that I do not find the plaintiff’s conduct in 2015 inconsistent with its case that the parties intend business confirmation emails to create legal relations. Whether the plaintiff is liable to the defendant in damages for breach of the 2015 dealing is not a matter before me and I express no view on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For the same reason, the defendant’s argument on estoppel by convention also falls away.

These essential terms include: the quantity, quality, price, laycan and type of vessel to be deployed (see [9] above). The only essential term which the parties failed to agree in the business confirmation emails is the identity of the load port surveyor.

The main case on which the defendant relies for this submission is <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span>. In that case too, coincidentally, the dispute was over whether the parties had reached a concluded contract for the sale of Indonesian steam coal, given that they had not agreed the identity of the load port surveyor. On the evidence before him, Andrew Ang J found himself unable to conclude that parties had reached agreement on the identity of the load port surveyor (at [37] and [39]). He held that the choice of load port surveyor was an essential term of the contract, without which the contract could not be enforced (at [35]). The plaintiff’s claim in <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span> therefore failed, even though the parties had an intention to create legal relations and had agreed all the other essential terms of their contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As a preliminary point, although both the plaintiff and the defendant appear to agree that the identity of the load port surveyor is a material term,

</div> I do not think that the parties considered the identity of the surveyor to be a <span class="font-italic">condition precedent</span> to the business confirmation emails of 29 March 2017 giving rise to a concluded contract. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Pagnan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in the passage cited at [56] above, “[i]t is for the parties<span class="font-italic"> </span>to decide whether they wish to be bound, and if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant”. Similarly, as Andrew Ang J also noted in <span class="font-italic">Rudhra Minerals</span> (at [27]), the determination of whether a term is essential is not a purely objective inquiry by the court. It seems to me more consistent with the conduct of the parties, for the reasons set out at [61]–[74] above, that they intended to be bound by the transaction even though the choice of load port surveyor remained “to be mutually agreed” (see [9] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 My views on this are strengthened by the fact that parties did not appear to have contemplated any dispute between them as to the identity of the surveyor. The issue of the surveyor’s identity was not so essential to the parties’ commercial bargain that they singled it out for discussion in the business confirmation emails or in the emails which followed to negotiate the detailed terms of the draft contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In fact, in all three of the parties’ previous dealings, the identity of the load port surveyor was never a source of contention:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the 2015 dealing, before it fell through, the plaintiff nominated the load port surveyor.

For this, Mr Ball relies on the prices of coal of three different calorific values. This aspect of Mr Ball’s methodology is not challenged by the defendant’s expert, Mr Benjamin Lawson. The calorific value of coal can be measured either on a Net as Received (NAR) basis or on a Gross as Received (GAR) basis.

I refer to the helpful observations in <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span> (Michael G Bridge gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th ed, 2017) at para 16-068:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The availability of buyers and sellers, and their ready capacity to supply or to absorb the relevant goods is the basic concept of an “available market” … A fluctuating market price indicates the existence of an available market, but it should not be a necessary test: “there must be sufficient traders, who are in touch with each other”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 at [30(b)] applied and accepted this observation, appearing in the then-current version of <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the strength of these authorities, I accept that all that the plaintiff needs to show is that there was a pool of potential buyers and sellers with the “ready capacity” to supply or absorb the coal on the relevant dates. Evidence of concluded contracts for coal on those dates certainly establishes that there was an available market. But that is not the only method of establishing an available market. The presence of bids and offers, even if unmatched, indicates that there were willing seller and willing buyers in the market, albeit at a price which attracted no acceptance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Second, even if I were to accept the defendant’s submission that there can be no available market without concluded contracts, I do not accept Mr Lawson’s evidence that there were no concluded contracts at the relevant time. As detailed above (at [120]), Mr Lawson’s methodology involved observing that there were no loaded vessels departing from the load port between 8 and 15 June 2017 and working backwards 15 to 20 days to arrive at the conclusion that there were no concluded contracts for coal from the load port between 18 May 2017 and 27 May 2017. In my view, this methodology is flawed because of the incorrect assumptions and incomplete data on which it is premised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 First, I do not accept Mr Lawson’s method of working 15 to 20 days backwards. The estimate of 15 to 20 days is to allow for the time taken between the parties concluding a contract and the nominated vessel arriving at the load port (or tendering NOR).

A spot contract is for delivery soon after the date of contracting. It thereby minimises both parties’ risk of adverse price movements between contract and delivery. In a term contract, parties may stipulate specific times for delivery which can range from days to years after the date of contracting.

The parties entered into a contract for the sale to the defendant of three cargoes of coal. The contract arose on 29 March 2017 from the business confirmation emails which the parties exchanged that day. There being no dispute as to breach, the defendant is liable to pay the plaintiff damages for breach of contract in the amount of US$1,465,850.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Judgment will therefore be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for the sum of US$1,465,850 and interest on that sum under s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, Rev Ed 1999). Interest under the Civil Law Act will run on the US$1,465,850 from 7 August 2017, the date on which the plaintiff issued the writ in this action, to 29 March 2019, the date of this judgment at the usual rate of 5.33% per annum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 That judgment will also include the plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to this action. Having heard the parties on costs, and having considered their costs schedules as well as the costs guidelines in Appendix G of the Practice Directions, I have fixed the plaintiff’s costs at S$129,000 including disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy   <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thomas Tan and Tan Xue Ting (Haridass Ho &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff;<br/>Joseph Tan and Joanna Poh (Legal Solutions LLC) <br/>for the defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
