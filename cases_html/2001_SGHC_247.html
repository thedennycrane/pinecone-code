bunkering business and provides shipping and marine logistics to the marine industry. They
are part of the Global Group comprising 12 companies, of which three are fully owned by
the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs are shareholders in the other companies. The Global Group

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5 On 7 September 2000, the
Defendants published the following news release:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Singapore’s Global
    Energy to sell 2 bunker barges</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Singapore (Platt’s) –
    7Sep2000/353 am EDT/753 GMT</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Global Energy, a Singapore-based
    bunker supplier is planning to sell two bunker barges, industry sources said Thursday. The
    barges which are up for sale include the 1,600mt "Star Progress" and the 4,000mt
    "Global Excellence", said sources. The 26-year oil Star Progress is a Category B
    barge, which will be obsolete by end-2000. Singapore’s Maritime Port Authority
    requires all bunker barges in Singapore waters to comply with Category A conditions which
    are a list of efficiency and operational standards set by MPA. Category B barges will not
    be allowed to operate in Singapore by Jan 2001. A high-sea bunker supplier was said to be
    keen to buy "Star Progress". Sources said Global Energy is selling the barges
    due to cash-flow problems. But will charter her on spot basis. Global officials declined
    to comment.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6 The Plaintiffs claimed the
above news release’s assertion that they were "selling the barges due to
cash-flow problems" was malicious and false because at no time did they offer to sell
their flagship "Global Excellence" and the "Star Progress" was only
offered for sale to comply with the Maritime Port Authority’s requirements. The
Plaintiffs averred that their business reputation and credit had been severely injured by
the defamatory news release which meant that the Plaintiffs:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) were selling their barges
    because they were insolvent and/or temporarily insolvent;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) had inadequate funds to meet
    their day to day operations and were planning to close down their business;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) were unable to meet their
    financial obligations as and when they fell due; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4) did not have sufficient
    financial standing to obtain credit lines to meet their financial obligations and had to
    resort to selling off their barges to raise funds.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7 The Defendants admitted
publishing the words in question but denied defaming the Plaintiffs. They pleaded the
defences of justification and qualified privilege.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8 The Plaintiffs then applied for
particulars of the defence of justification. The Defendants filed their particulars on 30
March 2001, pleading that the Plaintiffs had suffered losses, <i>inter alia</i>, in their
trading activities in the Middle East and Malaysia and had offered the barges for sale
and/or sale and lease back through a ship broker named Thome &amp; Partners for funds to
ease their cash flow difficulties. The Defendants stated that those were the best
particulars pending discovery.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9 The Plaintiffs then applied by
SIC 874/2001/B for further particulars. On 27 April 2001, an Assistant Registrar ordered
further particulars to be furnished within 10 days of discovery and inspection.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10 On 4 May 2001, at a Pre-Trial
Conference, the Registrar directed the parties to file their respective lists of documents
by 18 May 2001 and to complete inspection of documents by 25 May 2001, failing which the
action be dismissed with costs or the defence be struck out and judgment be entered for
the Plaintiffs with costs.</font></p>

    that the particulars would be contained in the discovery to be made available by your

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15 In the affidavit filed in
support of this application, the Defendants’ solicitors stated that the Defendants
would not be in a position to furnish the particulars ordered on 27 April 2001 without the
documents requested by them. They asserted that such documents should be in the
Plaintiffs’ possession, custody or power and were documents which:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) the Plaintiffs would have to
        rely on in the trial;</font></p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16 The Defendants claimed that
the accounting documents of the Global Group for 1998, 1999 and 2000 were clearly relevant
in establishing the financial position of the Plaintiffs in the months leading up to the
publication of the news release in September 2000 and whether the Plaintiffs were
experiencing cash flow problems which necessitated the disposal of the two vessels. The
Plaintiffs would have to rely on those documents to establish their own case on their
financial position.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17 Where the second category of
documents was concerned, the Defendants said they had pleaded in their particulars of 30
March 2001 that the Plaintiffs suffered losses in their trading activities in Malaysia and
the Middle East and that the sale of the vessels was to ease the cash flow problems. These
documents would be relevant in establishing the financial results of the business
activities in the areas in question and whether these had resulted in cash flow problems
to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs would have to rely on these documents to establish their
own case on their financial position.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18 For the third and fourth
categories of documents, the Plaintiffs had admitted there were attempts to sell the
vessel "Star Progress" (renamed "Dunia Bintang") but had disclosed no
documents relating to the sale. They would need to rely on these documents to support
their own plea as to the purpose of the sale of this vessel. It was usual for sale of
vessels to be effected through the assistance of a ship broker. If the Plaintiffs had
effected the sale of the "Star Progress" through Thome &amp; Partners, it would
not be unreasonable to expect that the documents relating to contacts with Thome &amp;
Partners or another party would be in the possession, custody or power of the Plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19 Although the Plaintiffs had
denied any attempt to sell the "Global Excellence", if they had documents
relating to such disposal, they were obliged to disclose them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20 The documents in these two
categories would enable the Defendants to determine whether there were attempts at
disposal of the two vessels and, if so, to embark on a train of inquiry as to the purpose
of such disposal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21 The last category of documents
concerned the change of name of "Star Progress" to "Dunia Bintang".
The Plaintiffs in their Reply pleaded that if the Defendants were diligent in their
reporting, they would have also realized that the name of the vessel had already been
changed in January 2000. No document on such change of name was disclosed by the
Plaintiffs who would have to show that the change took place in January 2000. These
documents would also enable the Defendants to establish whether such change had taken
place and to embark on a train of inquiry as to the purpose for such change.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><u></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE PLAINTIFFS’ AFFIDAVIT IN
OPPOSITION</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22 The Plaintiffs alleged that
the Defendants had failed to mention that their list of documents was just as bare as the
Plaintiffs’ was said to be . The Defendants had no basis to say that the Plaintiffs
were insolvent or were having cash-flow problems or that they had engaged the services of
Thome &amp; Partners. They also had no basis in alleging that the Plaintiffs suffered
losses in the Middle East or any part of the world and that they were even attempting to
sell the "Global Excellence", let alone doing that through Thome &amp; Partners.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23 The documents pertaining to
the purpose of the change of name were not relevant. Although the Plaintiffs had alleged
that the Defendants lacked diligence in reporting, their claim was for libel and not
negligence. In any event, the Defendants published another report on 21 March 2001 in
which they referred to the vessel by its correct name, thereby showing that they realized
that the first report had referred to the vessel by its former name.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ASSISTANT REGISTRAR’S
DECISION</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24 On 8 June 2001, the Assistant
Registrar dismissed the Defendants’ application for further and better discovery. He
then dealt with the Plaintiffs’ application in SIC 1254/2001 which sought to strike
out paragraph 8 of the Defence (on justification). He denied the application, ordering
that the Defendants comply with the Order of Court dated 27 April 2001 by 15 June 2001, in
default of which the said paragraph 8 be struck out. The Assistant Registrar ordered costs
fixed at $1,500 in respect of both applications to be paid by the Defendants to the
Plaintiffs.</font></p>

MY DECISION</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25 Before me, Counsel for the
Defendants stated that he was not asking for the documents in the second category as they
would be subsumed in the first. Similarly, he conceded that the third category of
documents ought to be subsumed in the fourth. He argued that the Plaintiffs were an exempt
private limited company and their accounts were not available to the public. The
Defendants were therefore entitled to their accounting documents. He conceded, however,
that the Defendants’ request was rather too wide and was content to leave out the
documents for 1998. As for the fifth category relating to the change of name, he argued
that this issue was one of the particulars of malice alleged by the Plaintiffs and the
Defendants were entitled to such documents because of their Defence of qualified

of Court provides:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"<b>Order for discovery (O.
    24, r. 1)</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. (1) Subject to this Rule
    and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time order any party to a cause or matter (whether
    begun by writ, originating summons or otherwise) to give discovery by making and serving
    on any other party a list of the documents which are or have been in his possession,
    custody or power, and may at the same time or subsequently also order him to make and file
    an affidavit verifying such a list and to serve a copy thereof on the other party.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) The documents which a party
    to a cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the documents on which the
            party relies or will rely; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) the documents which could
            – </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) adversely affect his own
            case;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) adversely affect another
            party’s case; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) support another
            party’s case.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) An order under this Rule may
    be limited to such documents or classes of documents only, or to only such of the matters
    in question in the cause or matter, as may be specified in the order."</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27 Order 24 rule 2 concerns
determination of an issue or question before discovery and is not relevant to the case
here. Order 24 rule 7 mandates that discovery is to be ordered only if necessary. It
states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"7. On the hearing of an
    application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery
    is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as
    the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an
    order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for
    disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs."</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28 In <i>Business Software
Alliance &amp; Ors v S M Summit Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[2000] 2 SLR 733</nobr>, the
Defendants in the libel action there filed two applications for a further and better list
of documents and specific discovery of certain documents from the Plaintiffs. At paragraph
33 of the judgment, the Court of Appeal said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"33. We now come to the
        documents the defendants seek from the plaintiffs. The question is whether the documents
        sought satisfy the test of relevancy. …"</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Court of Appeal then dealt
with the <i>Peruvian Guano Co case</i> [1882 – 83] 11 QBD 55 and <i>McDonald’s
Corp. &amp; Anor v Steel &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1995] 3 AER 616</nobr> and continued (at paragraphs 35
and 36):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"35. Mr Elias submits that
    the requirements set out above are satisfied on the facts. The particulars of
    justification state that Summit CD ‘habitually accepted, processed and delivered
    orders for stampers and CD-Roms’ from the alleged software pirates. These particulars
    were pleaded on the basis of the information provided by Pan and Shi and were therefore
    well grounded. The defendants are therefore entitled to discovery of documents to
    substantiate what they have pleaded.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36. We are unable to accept this
    argument. Whilst the particulars of justification do clearly refer to dealings with the
    alleged software pirates, this alone does not give the defendants carte blanche to empty
    the plaintiffs’ filing cabinets. In defamation actions the <i><b>Peruvian Guano</b></i>
    principle is subject to the well established rule that a defendant is not permitted to
    mount a fishing expedition through the discovery process in the hope of finding something
    to justify his libellous words. The documents in category (1) are described as ‘All
    the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or correspondence’ of Summit CD
    relating to the alleged software pirates. That is a remarkably wide class of documents
    which would encompass any letter or note on any matter whatsoever between Summit CD and
    the alleged pirates. The lack of specificity in this regard can only lead us to infer
    that, in fact, the defendants have no knowledge of any particular transactions which would
    substantiate their plea of justification. That being the case, they are clearly trying to
    empty the cupboards in the hope of finding something to substantiate their plea. This
    amounts to a fishing expedition. We do not read <i><b>McDonald’s</b></i> case as
    saying that by merely pleading that a particular fact is true, a defendant in a libel
    action is entitled to obtain by discovery all the plaintiffs’ documents to see
    whether there is anything in them to sustain the plea. All that case says is that a plea
    of justification will not be struck out before the trial on the basis that there is no
    ‘clear and sufficient’ evidence to sustain it, as some previous authorities
    seemed to suggest. In any event, that case did not concern the issue of relevancy of the
    documents sought in discovery and is therefore of limited assistance to the
    defendants."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34 Applying these principles to
the Defendants’ application here, the first category of documents (which includes the
second category, as conceded by the Defendants) was indeed remarkably wide in that it
covered all accounting records of the <u>entire</u> Global Group over three years. If the
Defendants were correct in their assertion that they were entitled to all such documents,
they would effectively be espousing the following proposition:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If Defendant is sued for defaming
    Plaintiff by alleging that Plaintiff is in financial difficulties and Defendant pleads the
    defence of justification, Defendant is entitled to ask Plaintiff to disclose all his
    financial records (including bank statements) for the preceding three years.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The above proposition is
startling because it would in effect be reversing the burden of proof – i.e. the
Plaintiff has to divulge all his confidential financial matters to the Defendant to show
that he is not in financial difficulties.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35 Merely stating that they
believed that "the Plaintiffs had suffered losses in <i>inter alia</i> their trading
activities in Malaysia and the Middle East" could not assist the Defendants in their
unjustifiable quest to hopefully catch some fish of justification somewhere in the expanse
of the Global ocean. It is akin to the situation where A says B is in financial straits as
he has lost money in shares and, when sued for defamation, tells B to reveal all his and
his family’s financial records for the last three years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36 Since the Plaintiffs’
audited accounts were not available to the public at large, as an indulgence to the
Defendants, I was prepared to order that only the Plaintiffs’ (and not the Global
Group’s) audited accounts for financial years 1999 and 2000 be disclosed. I ordered
such disclosure by the Plaintiffs within seven days from my order.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37 Where the third and fourth
categories of documents were concerned, it was apparent from the Defendants’
supporting affidavit that they had no basis in saying that the Plaintiffs or the Global
Group had any documents pertaining to any dealings with Thome &amp; Partners. Further, it
was strange that the Defendants were asking for documents relating to the sale of
"Global Excellence" when the Plaintiffs had pleaded that they had not offered
that vessel for sale. These roaming searches could only lead to the inference that the
Defendants lacked knowledge of any particular facts which would substantiate their plea of
justification. I therefore affirmed the Assistant Registrar’s refusal to order
discovery of these categories. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38 The last category of documents
was in relation to the change of name of "Star Progress" to "Dunia
Bintang". From the pleadings, the only issue that arose from this was the assertion
by the Plaintiffs that the change of name took place in January 2000. Although I affirmed
the Assistant Registrar’s refusal to order discovery of these documents, upon further
reflection, I think it would have been fair to order discovery of documents evidencing the
date of change and nothing else. The subsequent news release by the Defendants on 21 March
2001 merely referred to the new name without acknowledging that the change of name had
taken place in January 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39 The Defendants failed in their
appeal by and large except for the documents mentioned in paragraph 36 of this judgment. I
therefore ordered them to pay $1,200 costs to the Plaintiffs in respect of the appeal. I
do not think what I have said in the preceding paragraph about documents pertaining to the
date of change would have affected my decision on the issue of costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40 On 19 July 2001, upon the
request of the Plaintiffs, I granted them an extension of time until 20 August 2001 to
furnish the documents ordered to be disclosed as their audited accounts for financial year
2000 were not available yet.</font></p>
