The claimant was the contractor for the Project pursuant to a contract (the “Contract”) signed with the defendant. Consequently, the claimant applied for an injunction to restrain the defendant from receiving payment under the Bond. In the alternative, the claimant also prayed for an order that the amount which the defendant was entitled to receive under the call on the bond be assessed and reduced to reasonably account for retention sums that were already held by the defendant in the sum of $233,116.67. An interim injunction had been granted by the court on 30 August 2023.

The claimant also prayed, in the alternative, for a reduction in the Bond sum that the defendant is allowed to call on and receive in order to account for the retention sum of $233,116.67 which is currently held by the defendant.

</div> The claimant was consequently entitled to not just the time relief sought under the COTMA but also relief from liability for LDs pursuant to s 6(5) COTMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The COTMA was enacted to provide temporary measures to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society. Two key reliefs offered by the COTMA are of relevance for this dispute. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Firstly, Part 8A of the COTMA creates a framework for extensions of time for construction contracts. In gist, ss 39A and 39B COTMA provide that for constructions contracts: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) which were entered into before 25 March 2020; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) which remain in force on 2 November 2020; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) where the construction works under the contract have not been certified as complete as at 7 April 2020,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">the completion date for those works is extended by up to 122 days from and including the original contractual completion date. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, s 6(5) COTMA reduces the liability of contractors to pay LDs under a construction contract impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In gist, s 6(5) COTMA, read with Order 3(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Extension of Prescribed Period) (No. 4) Order 2021 and ss 5(1) and 6(1) COTMA, provides that for the purpose of calculating the LDs payable under the construction contract, where:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the contractor was unable to perform its obligation under the contract due to COVID-19 restrictions; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the contractor had served a notification for relief; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the contractor suffered an inability to perform due to COVID-19 restrictions for a period of time (the “Inability Period”), </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">the portion of the Inability Period that fell within the period of 1 February 2020 to 28 February 2022 is to be disregarded in determining the period of delay in performance by the contractor when calculating LDs. In other words, referring to Example 2 to clause 6 in the Explanatory Statement to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, the contractor is not liable for liquidated or other damages for the period of delay so long as the delay occurs within the prescribed period (1 February 2020 to 28 February 2022) and in so far as the delay was caused to a material extent by the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The claimant asked me to make the inference of unconscionability referred to at [12] above on the basis that the defendant knew as early as August 2022 that they intended to make an LDs claim,

A related supplementary issue is, even if I find that the defendant had not acted unconscionably, whether the amount of the call on the Bond should be reduced in light of the fact that the defendant had sufficient security to cover any damages that they may suffer as a result of the claimant’s acts under the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The law on unconscionability in the context of calls on performance (on-demand) bonds in construction contracts is most helpfully summarised by the Court of Appeal in the leading case of <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 3 SLR 352 (“<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is settled law that unconscionability is a ground upon which the court can grant an injunction restraining a beneficiary of a performance bond from calling on the bond: <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [18]. The case law has shown that a finding of unconscionability is a conclusion applied to conduct which the court finds to be so lacking in <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> such that an injunction restraining the beneficiary’s substantive rights is warranted: <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [45]. Unconscionability includes elements of abuse, unfairness and dishonesty: <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [19]. The Court of Appeal emphasised at [20] of <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span> that the threshold of unconscionability “is a high one, and the burden that the applicant has to discharge is to demonstrate a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability”. The Court of Appeal went on to say, at [21]–[22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21     When determining if a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case has been made out, the entire context of the case must be thoroughly considered, and it is only if the entire context of the case is particularly malodorous that such an injunction should be granted. We must emphasise that the courts’ discretion to grant such injunctions must be sparingly exercised and it should not be an easy thing for an applicant to establish a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22     The reason for setting the barrier at such a high level is that the equitable remedy of the interim prohibitive injunction is a very harsh one. It restricts the person in whose favour the performance bond was issued (“the beneficiary”) from doing that which he was entitled by agreement of the parties to do, and which he in all probability had bargained for during the negotiations leading up to the contract concerned. In essence, he would be prevented from enforcing a substantive right which he had contracted for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Importantly, the Court of Appeal also provided guidance in respect of calls on performance bonds on <span class="font-italic">mistaken </span>premises. The Court of Appeal stated at [52] that even if the bond beneficiary called on the bond on the basis of a mistakenly held belief that the counterparty was in breach, “the call could still be legitimate if this position was genuinely adopted and the [beneficiary] honestly believed that the [counterparty] was in breach.” The Court of Appeal emphasised that it “is not the court’s role in such proceedings to appraise the merits of the parties’ decisions; but, rather, <span class="font-italic">it is the court’s role to be alive to the lack of </span>bona fides<span class="font-italic"> in those decisions</span>.” Implicit in the Court of Appeal’s holding – that a <span class="font-italic">mistaken </span>but <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>call on a performance bond would not fall foul of the doctrine of unconscionability – is the notion that the court examines the bond beneficiary’s decision at the time the decision to call on the bond was made to determine the <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>or lack thereof in that decision. Applying the Court of Appeal’s guidance, the court in <span class="font-italic">JK Integrated (Pte Ltd) v 50 Robinson Pte Ltd and another</span> [2015] SGHC 57 at [72] opined that even if the court took the injunction applicant’s case at its highest and found that the applicant did not commit contractual breaches, so long as the bond beneficiary had the honest but mistaken belief that the applicant had done so, the call on the bond would still have been legitimate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No strong </span><span class="font-weight-bold">prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> case of unconscionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Looking at the conduct of the parties as a whole, I found the evidence pointing to a distracted claimant who seemed preoccupied by wider (solvency) issues surrounding the company (see [54] below). Notwithstanding the relief provided by the COTMA, the claimant still appeared to be in delay and behind the curve in their undertaking of the project. The defendant seemed frustrated (and even exasperated at times) by the claimant’s lack of progress. Against this background, the claimant had not made out their case and satisfied their burden of proof that there was a a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability on the part of the defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The starting point for my decision had to be the fact that the claimant had a high burden to overcome to demonstrate unconscionability. A high degree of strictness had to be applied to the claimant’s case, with the claimant required to establish a clear case of fraud or unconscionability, and mere allegations are insufficient: <span class="font-italic">Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 at [57], citing <span class="font-italic">Bocotra</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd and others v Attorney-General</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 262 at [48]. I had to be satisfied that the defendant’s conduct was so lacking in good faith that unconscionability was demonstrated and hence an injunction on the call on the Bond would be justified: <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [45].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 There is good reason for such a strict standard to be applied. A performance bond in the context of a construction contract is a contractual bargain between the parties to that contract allowing the beneficiary to call on that bond as a safeguard for the contractor’s performance. The Bond was required under the Contract <span class="font-italic">per</span> Clause 26 of the Conditions of Contract, as reproduced above at [4]. The Bond was part of the parties’ bargain in this case and, putting it crudely, was as good as cash. I needed to be very careful before I interfered in this contractual bargain, and I also needed to be very careful not to set a precedent which expanded the scope of the court’s interference in these bargains such that greater commercial uncertainty in their application was created.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The LDs claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Looking at the specific issues in turn and starting with the LDs, I was not convinced that an inference of unconscionability should be found because of the Architect’s supposed error in the calculation of the LDs and the defendant’s hesitancy in failing to expressly demand for those LDs. There was no express written evidence pointing to any bad faith on the part of the Architect and the defendant, but I was asked to make an inference based on their conduct. Whilst I agree that the Architect and the defendant were not as cogent as they could have been with respect to an explicit claim for LDs, that does not amount to unconscionability. I failed to infer any unconscionable conduct on the part of the defendant in its dealings with the Architect (as described at [14] and [16]). In fact, the claimant had been aware of the defendant’s LD entitlement as certified by the Architect as early as September 2022 (through the Certificate of LD Entitlement – see [16]) even if an express claim for such LDs had not been made until later (see [16]). I also agreed with the defendant’s assertion that the notes found at the bottom of the Certificate of LD Entitlement were most likely to be stock language used together with this form of certificate (see [17]) as the Architect (acting independently) would have been more explicit if there was an honest belief that they knew of any error with their LD calculation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In that regard, the claimant felt that it had a stronger case with respect to its submission that the Architect had either erred in their interpretation of s 6(5) of the COTMA or was unaware of its existence (see [12] and [15]), thus resulting in some sort of collusive unconscionable conduct as between the Architect and the defendant. I am not required to rule on the merits of whether the LDs claim was contractually and legally justified as part of this application, so I was not required to rule on the interpretation of s 6(5) of the COTMA. The Architect may well have been mistaken in not taking this into account when LDs were certified but the Architect’s error does not equal unconscionability on the part of the defendant. In <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj and another v Teo Hee Lai Building Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 394 (“<span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span>”), one of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the appellants ought not to have made a demand for payment under a performance bond as they had sufficient security in their hands for the cost of rectification work (<span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj </span>at [13]). It was argued that the appellants held a substantial sum of the contractor’s money because the latter’s claim for a progress payment, which amounted to $265,190.17, had not been certified by the architect. The Court of Appeal held at [13] of <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj </span>that it was not the court’s task to determine which party’s estimated cost for the rectification of defects is more realistic, nor was it the court’s task to determine whether or not the architect should have certified the contractor’s claim for $265,190.17. Ultimately, the Court of Appeal was not convinced that it was unconscionable for the appellants to make a demand under the terms of the performance bond because they had sufficient security. The court does not engage in a detailed merits review when hearing an application to injunct the call on a performance bond. Such applications for an injunction are interlocutory proceedings, so the court would not be equipped to undertake a full, detailed, and exhaustive review of the merits of the parties’ respective allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Furthermore, the parties had agreed in the Contract for the Architect to act independently and to exercise its judgment on the certification of LDs and the defendant was entitled to and did rely on the Architect’s decision in this regard (see [18]) even if the Architect had acted in error. I found no unconscionable conduct in that reliance as there was no explicit impropriety in the behaviour of the Architect or the defendant and I could not infer any such unconscionability based on the circumstantial evidence the claimant had placed before me in their submissions ([12] to [16]). In this regard, the decision of <span class="font-italic">CEX v CEY and another</span> [2021] 3 SLR 571 (“<span class="font-italic">CEX (Judgment)</span>”) provides useful guidance. In <span class="font-italic">CEX (Judgment)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the court found that when the architect is called on to exercise his independent judgment and issue certificates, he cannot be the agent of the employer (<span class="font-italic">CEX (Judgment) </span>at [61]). At [62], the court further found that in so far as the architect was expected to act independently, his alleged errors were not attributable to the employer and his conduct in issuing his certificates was “simply irrelevant in determining whether [the employer] had acted unconscionably”. The court caveated its holding by noting that if the employer had been put on notice about something improper about the architect’s certification process and had proceeded to call on the bond regardless, there may be an argument that the employer had acted unconscionably. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this case, as noted above at [6], the Architect had a duty under the Contract to act independently and impartially, in accordance with professional codes of conduct, when issuing certificates relating to liquidated damages and assessing and granting extensions of time. When executing these duties, the Architect was not acting as the defendant’s agent: <span class="font-italic">CEX (Judgment) </span>at [61], citing <span class="font-italic">Hiap</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 458 at [35]. There is no evidence to suggest that the defendant had been put on notice about something improper about the Architect’s certification process and had proceeded to call on the bond regardless. In fact, there is evidence of meeting minutes

</div> recording a discussion held on 11 April 2023 between the defendant, the restoration consultant, the Architect, and the quantity surveyors where the issue of COTMA reliefs were expressly discussed. The quantity surveyor “confirmed that COTMA claims have already been taken into account in the draft Statement of Final Account” and that “valid COTMA relief claims have already been taken into account”. The architect agreed to issue a letter stating that “valid COTMA relief claims have already been taken into account, and stating there are no more valid EOT claims to be assessed”. Faced with such advice from their advisors, there is nothing that would put the defendant on notice that their architect had not considered the COTMA reliefs, or had done something improper. The defendant should not be put in a position where it had to second guess the decisions of an independent architect in the absence of knowledge of a clear error.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dome and tarmac issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I tackled the dome and tarmac issues together as both involved disputes on issues of the interpretation of the Contract and disputes of fact as to whether works had been omitted. The claimant had fundamentally disagreed that the dome and tarmac works were within the claimant’s work scope (see [21], [22], [27] and [28] above) and thus asked me to conclude that when these works were taken away from the claimant’s responsibilities, it was impossible to conclude that the defendant was entitled to the damages that they sought and had thus acted unconscionably. The claimant’s arguments however lost their shine when the defendant pointed to correspondence which showed clear acknowledgement by the claimant that it was to undertake the tarmac and dome repair works (see [26] and [29] above respectively). The defendant’s explanation as to why the tarmac repairs were supposedly struck out from the Completion Certificate (when read in context with the conditions set out in the Completion Certificate) were also convincing (see [25] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The defendant’s arguments were by no means always cogent. It was not clear to me whether the cost of the tarmac repair works (within the claimant’s work scope) consisted of just the repairs to the tarmac damaged by the claimant’s heavy lifting equipment or wider works to other parts of the tarmac as well. The defendant pointed to the latter and, in particular, to the defects list of 6 April 2023

</div> which the defendant mentioned in its oral submissions as “undisputed”. However, looking at this document, it was not clear to me whether this was as conclusive as the defendant made it out to be. The claimant’s argument on the disparity between the cost of tarmac works in the Contract as compared to the quote from RBPL (see [21] above) also deserves an answer. Looking at the range of three quotes obtained by the defendant,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-b137ec84-538b-4ca0-a375-c55b78bea3ac" data-toggle="modal" type="button">83</button></sup>

</div>
</div> it is noted that RBPL is the middle of the three quotes (looking at the totality of works quoted) and yet the most expensive of the three quotes (by totality of works quoted) only quoted $36,120 for the tarmac works, compared to $227,040 from RBPL (for the tarmac works) and $81,700 for the tarmac works (from the lowest of the three quotes by totality of works quoted). The only conclusion to be drawn from this wide range of quotes seems to be that the quotes provided were likely on a “desktop” basis and not based on a detailed study of the work involved. Unfortunately for the claimant, looking at the quotes obtained by the defendant as a whole (rather than cherry picking the specific quote for tarmac works from RBPL), this lessens the impact of its argument that there was impropriety in an excessive claim for tarmac works whilst making the defendant’s argument that the quotes sought were rough and incomplete even more plausible..    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Ultimately, the conduct of the parties, the correspondence, the Architect’s instructions and whether and to what extent the dome and tarmac works were within the claimant’s work scope are clearly issues in dispute that would need to be addressed by the tribunal taking charge of the substantive dispute. For the purposes of this application, which is interlocutory in nature, I am not engaged to delve deeply into those disputes and to determine the merits of the parties’ respective cases on each of their disputes. I was asked to consider if the conduct of the defendant reflected a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability.

The claimant alleged that the sums in (b) still showed an excess in favour of the defendant and it should not be entitled to benefit from this excess (see [33] above). In the claimant’s written submissions, the claimant had further argued that the court should apply a reduction to the quantum of the Bond call to take into account the value of the claims for “Additional Preliminaries amounting to SGD 600,000, which the Claimant has submitted to the Architect”.

In <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span>, the Court of Appeal had reduced the amount that the employer was permitted to call and receive from the bond from $1.6m to $600,000 (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span>at [42]). This was because the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the main contractor was owed moneys under a progress claim (“progress claim No 32”) that was quantified by the main contractor at around $1,253,240 (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span>at [40]). The Court of Appeal reasoned as follows at [41]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Notwithstanding this uncertainty, progress claim No 32 is a factor which ought to have been taken into account. Bearing in mind that <span class="font-italic">we are not here involved in an exercise in quantifying damages but only in ensuring that the amount of the bond called for is not unconscionable and taking a broad approach</span>, we think there should be a reduction of $1m from the sum which the court below had directed that the respondents should be entitled to call.

I was called upon to take a “broad approach” and I had to decide whether the present call on the Bond gave the defendant “ample security, without being that inordinate as to be unconscionable” (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span>at [41]). I was ultimately unconvinced that the present call on the Bond was that inordinate as to cross the unconscionability threshold. The defendant had quantified their claims against the claimant at a total sum of $825,660.00, taking into account the claims for liquidated damages, outstanding warranties and outstanding works.

</div> I have found above that the defendant did not lack <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> when making their claims for these sums. Adding the Bond sum of $629,998.70 and the retention sum of $233,116.67, the resulting total of $863,115.37 is not incommensurate with the total claim of $825,660.00. I take the defendant’s point that as of the date of the call on the Bond, the Statement of Final Account has not been issued, so the claim estimates are rough estimations, and there is some uncertainty in the quantification of the claims.

</div> I was unable to give any weight to this argument. The present originating application was filed on 29 August 2023. The defendant’s call on the Bond was on 20 July 2023. This “Claim for Additional Preliminaries”, having been raised nearly three months after the Bond call and one-and-a-half months after this originating application was filed, is not relevant to the assessment of the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> at the time the Bond call was made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For the sake of completeness, it should also be noted that the claimant’s managing director, Mr Harry Tan Chin Choon (“Mr Tan”), filed a second affidavit in this application to explain that a number of allegations made against the defendant in Mr Tan’s first affidavit (which was used to obtain the interim injunction) were inaccurate. Harry Tan’s first affidavit had failed to disclose that the Architect had in fact issued a certificate of LDs and its assessment as to the extension of time claims made by the claimant.

</div> The claimant had used these alleged omissions by the Architect to bolster its case on unconscionability on the part of the defendant during the hearing for the interim injunction. In Mr Tan’s second affidavit, he conceded that, because of staff turnover and the fact that he was preoccupied with the moratorium issues concerning the claimant, he had inadvertently forgotten that the Architect had in fact made these certifications and assessments. Whilst my decision on this application did not turn on Mr Tan’s forgetfulness, these were glaring and material omissions on his part (even if innocent) and helped to corroborate the defendant’s position that the claimant was not well organised in their carrying out of the project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Ultimately, an applicant seeking to injunct a call on an unconditional performance bond bears a high burden. Such an applicant has to convince the court that it is just and fair for the court to assist him in reneging on a contractual promise that he has made. This is why, as the Court of Appeal emphasised at [20] of <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span>, “the burden that the applicant has to discharge is to demonstrate a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability”. The claimant in the present case has not discharged this high burden. Upon a review of all the evidence, I found <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>disputes between the parties, and I found that the defendant had justifiably relied on its advisors’ advice in calling on the Bond.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the form of application for the <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction, I noted that in <span class="font-italic">SH Design &amp; Build Pte Ltd v BD </span><span class="font-italic">Cranetech Pte Ltd</span> [2018] SGHC 133 (“<span class="font-italic">SH Design </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Build</span>”), the application was made via an oral application (<span class="font-italic">SH Design &amp; Build </span>at [78]) and in <span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh Construction Pte Ltd v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHC 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh</span>”), the application was made via letter (<span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh </span>at [27]). In the spirit of O 3 r 1 of the Rules of Court 2021, I took the view that the courts should adopt a practical approach to such applications and I allowed the claimant to proceed with this application made by way of letter. A formal application by summons is not discouraged or wrong but <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunctions, by their nature, are often sought as a matter of urgency, so there should be no rule disallowing an oral application or an application by letter following a court’s decision on a particular matter where the applicant can demonstrate that the practicalities of the case demands such an approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Following <span class="font-italic">SH Design &amp; Build </span>at [92]–[93], which quoted the seminal authority in <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> Properties Ltd and Another v Cheshire County Council</span> [1974] 2 WLR 749, the grounds on which an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction should be granted are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether there is a likelihood that the appeal will succeed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the appeal will be rendered nugatory if a stay was not granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I accepted the claimant’s arguments that there was a likelihood that the appeal would succeed. The claimant’s submissions were not frivolous or a bare denial and disagreement with the reasons behind my decision. There was a fair argument that I should have gone behind the architect’s decision with respect to s 6(5) of the COTMA and there was an equally fair submission that my judgment to dismiss the claims relating to the tarmac and the dome repairs as <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>contractual disputes was too hasty. The standard should not be set so strictly that there must be a high likelihood of success in the appeal, but the applicant for an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction should be ready to state with sufficiently detailed particulars the reasons why its arguments on appeal will succeed based on a fair and objective standard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I however disagreed that the appeal will be rendered nugatory if an injunction was not granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Firstly, the negation test must stand on its own two feet and the test for whether an appeal will be rendered nugatory cannot depend on other issues outside the four corners of this case. As the court stated at [30] of <span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh</span>, “[f]or an Erinford Order to be granted, the risk of negation must relate to the appeal or the dispute between the parties”. In <span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh</span>, the applicant for the <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction had submitted that it would suffer prejudice without the injunction because the disclosure of a successful call on the bond would prejudice its chances of securing other projects. The court held that this potential prejudice to the applicant in securing other projects was not related to either the appeal or the dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh </span>at [30]). In the present case, the fact that the claimant was in a precarious commercial position was outside the control of the defendant and it cannot be the case that the claimant’s solvency issues were used as an excuse not to comply with its contractual obligations – whether with the defendant or otherwise.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The substance of the dispute between parties would survive whether the claimant survived their solvency woes, or if they are placed under liquidation or judicial management. In other words, if it is found that the amounts called under the Bond by the defendant are excessive, those amounts can be recovered by the claimant, its liquidators or judicial managers. Put yet another way, the amounts called under the Bond would be reflected in the claimant’s accounts in insolvency as a contingent liability (even if the <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction was granted). From the perspective of an investor or other interested party looking at the claimant’s accounts, there is likely little difference between an actual liability due to the bond issuer, Lonpac (once the bond amounts are released to the defendant) and a contingent liability to Lonpac pending the appeal. Indeed, I note that in <span class="font-italic">Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Herh</span> at [29], the court then was equally untroubled by this point as it held that the plaintiff would not be denied its primary remedy in the event its appeal is successful since the success of the appeal would come with the grant of an interim injunction such that any sum received by the bond beneficiary pursuant to the bond call would have to be paid back. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Finally, and with respect to the perception point, the application for an injunction on the payment under the Bond has already been dismissed. The negative perception of that dismissal is already present and the denial of an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span> injunction pending the appeal will do little to worsen those perceptions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In relation to the claimant’s argument on the lack of irreparable prejudice caused to the defendant from the grant of the <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction, I was not convinced by this argument. Referring to the grounds for the grant of an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction as stated at [61] above, prejudice to the defendant is not one of the grounds. As for the claimant’s argument that Lonpac would be prejudiced from having to pay out on the Bond, this is plainly irrelevant. Lonpac, as bond issuer, had participated in a commercial bargain where it agreed to undertake unconditionally and irrevocably to pay on demand the Bond sum (see [5] above). Undoubtedly, the commercial risks associated with such a business would have been priced in. There is nothing untoward with holding Lonpac to this bargain it had made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I therefore dismissed the claimant’s application for an <span class="font-italic">Erinford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction. I ordered costs to the defendant in the sum of $1,500 (including disbursements).</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Wong Li Kok, Alex<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Chong Guang Charles, Ryan Mark Lopez and Nilesh Khetan (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Spring and Farahna Alam (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
