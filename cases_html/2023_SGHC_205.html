He informed Prime which informed Shimizu in turn on 12 July 2019. On 15 July 2019, Shimizu e-mailed Prime with a list of queries and its concerns about the quality of steel purchased from China.

In regard to the roof crown works, Andrew warned Pro-Active that the owner was considering revoking those works from Pro-Active’s scope of works if not for the fact that Prime said it had purchased the steel. Andrew added that there were strong objections to Pro-Active’s request to fabricate the steel for the roof crown works in China.

Kuon was shocked as days earlier, he was in communication with Prime on securing nuts and bolts for the roof crown works. He had even sent a summary list of the nuts and bolts meant for those works.

He pointed out that the contracted works were a re-measurement contract in any case. It should be noted at this stage that the materials purchased from Qingdao Co for the roof crown works were paid by a letter of credit (“the L/C”) established by Prime at Pro-Active’s request as the latter did not have the means to make payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The upshot of the communication between Pro-Active and Prime was that in and after December 2019, Pro-Active stopped doing any work relating to the roof crown and Prime and/or Shimuzu arranged for the roof crown works to be carried out by another subcontractor Kong Hwee Iron Works &amp; Construction Pte Ltd (“Kong Hwee”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Kuon’s AEIC

The variation works were initially estimated to amount to $1,351,320.95.  Kuon alleged that Pro-Active’s works were delayed by Prime’s delay in making payment on Pro-Active’s progress claims. This allegedly led to financial difficulties for Pro-Active and affected the latter’s materials procurement, its payment of salaries and expenses, and its payments to its suppliers. Kuon complained that it was unfair for Prime to charge Pro-Active for delay when the delay was caused by Prime’s requests for additional works.

He deposed that by early December 2019 it became apparent to Prime that Pro-Active did not have the manpower to carry out the installation component and the Variation Order in relation to the roof crown works. Around that time, Shimizu had already informed Prime that if those works could not be carried out according to schedule, Shimizu would take over the installation component of the roof crown works and look to Prime for all costs incurred thereby. Hence, Prime, via Andrew, issued the catch-up schedule to Pro-Active on 6 December 2019. Sonny deposed in his AEIC

His testimony is untrue in any case in the light of Shimizu’s e-mail in [83] terminating the roof crown portion of Pro-Active’s scope of works. Had Kuon really deployed more and adequate manpower as Prime (and Shimizu) requested, the roof crown works as well as the trellis works, which Pro-Active took over from Yabo (see [61] above), would not have been removed from Pro-Active’s contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 During cross-examination of Andrew, counsel for Pro-Active had latched onto Andrew’s e-mail at [80] and Andrew’s words “Yabo has practically got their act together &amp; caught up to Proactive” to contend

There, one of the heads of damages in dispute was a sum for liquidated damages payable by the plaintiff main contractor to the overall employer (<span class="font-italic">Peak Construction </span>at 121). The argument made by the plaintiff main contractor was that it was liable to pay liquidated damages to the overall employer because of a 58-week delay in completion, and this delay was caused by the defendant subcontractor’s breach of its sub-contract. On the plaintiff main contractor’s case, they could recover this sum as damages from the defendant subcontractor. On appeal, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff main contractor was not liable to pay any liquidated damages for delay to the overall employer (<span class="font-italic">Peak Construction </span>at 121), and therefore cannot claim this sum as damages from the defendant sub-contractor. The court held that no liquidated damages were payable to the overall employer because the failure to complete on time was at least partly “due to the employer’s own fault or breach of contract”, and that “liquidated damages and extension of time clauses in printed forms of contract must be construed strictly <span class="font-italic">contra proferentum</span>”. Here, Pro-Active could not/did not substantiate Kuon’s allegation (see [14] above) that Prime was responsible for its delayed works.

It is based on the fact that Pro-Active is contractually obliged to pay for the installation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the roof crown works as long as Prime engaged another subcontractor to carry out that installation. It was not disputed that Kong Hwee did carry out those works, subject to the caveat that its appointment was done by Shimizu.

Pro-Active’s dispute largely related to labour that was sourced from a number of construction companies. Pro-Active’s primary objection to the invoices was that Kuon was not given prior notice of nor was there prior discussion, of those charges before they were levied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As was noted at [95] and from clause 7.1 at [87] and item 40 of Appendix D to the LOA, there is no contractual provision in the LOA that obliges Prime to give prior notice of or have a prior discussion, of back charges before they were imposed either directly on Pro-Active by Prime or indirectly when back charged by Shimizu or by Positive downstream to Prime. If Prime was not given notice by the party imposing the back charges, by the same token, Pro-Active should not expect Prime to give notice when those same back charges were passed onto Pro-Active.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In regard to the labour back charges, Pro-Active again produced no evidence whatsoever to rebut Andrew’s evidence that it had insufficient manpower on site for the contracted works and that was why its progress was behind schedule and which prompted Shimizu to remove the roof crown from Pro-Active’s scope of works.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Consequently, on a balance of probabilities which is all that Prime is required to prove, the court finds that the back charges imposed by Prime on Pro-Active are legitimate or valid. As one example, the court refers to the charge for Roflo (see [48] above) of $11,242.23 (before 15% administrative charge and GST) for conducting the façade inspection at the Qingdao Co. That is clearly a legitimate charge as Roflo had to ensure the quality of the façade was in compliance with the specified standard before the material was shipped to Singapore. It was absurd of Kuon to contend (see [48] above) that any inspection should have been conducted in Singapore. That would have been too late – the quality of Qingdao Co’s materials should rightly be checked <span class="font-italic">before</span> the materials leave the factory where it was fabricated.  It was equally absurd of Kuon to say that quality control was no longer Pro-Active’s responsibility. He had admitted (after considerable prevarication) that Qingdao Co was Pro-Active’s supplier

</div>. In <span class="font-italic">Vim’s</span> case, the Appellate Division of the High Court was highly critical of the defendant Deluge for producing unreadable and/or un-decipherable documents/photographs leading the court to conclude there was woefully inadequate substantiation put forward by Deluge for its claim for substantial back charges from Vim. Was that the case here as Pro-Active submitted? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 It would be appropriate at this juncture to quote the same helpful extract from B. R. Burrows J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Impact Painting Ltd v Man-Shield (Alta) Construction Inc</span> [2018] AWLD 582 that the court in <span class="font-italic">Vim’s</span> case did at [102]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, the onus is on the party claiming a back charge to prove that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The back charge is for an expense actually, necessarily and reasonably incurred by the party claiming the back charge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. By the terms of the subcontract, or by some other agreement between the parties, the charge is one, or is in relation to some task, for which the subcontractor undertook responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. The general contractor incurred the expense because the subcontractor defaulted on the responsibility to which the charge relates.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Prior to incurring the charge, the general contractor gave notice to the subcontractor of its default and a reasonable opportunity to cure it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The court is of the view that Prime fulfilled all four requirements in this case. In regard to s/n 1, 2 and 3 in [102], by the terms of the LOA namely clauses 3.2, 5.7 (read with clause 1(b)(i) of Appendix C), 9.1 and 9.3 (see [108] above). Prime necessarily incurred the back charge(s) because of Pro-Active’s delayed works and/or omission of the roof crown works from its scope of works. For s/n 4 in [103], Andrew’s correspondence with Kuon at [80] to [81] gave notice that Pro-Active must speed up its works by deploying more manpower if it did not want to face the dire consequences.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Consequently, all back charges incurred by Prime that arose from Shimizu’s removal of the installation component of the roof crown works must necessarily be for Pro-Active’s account. A quick review of the back charges show (apart from labour supply to enable Pro-Active to catch up) that the items were all related to the installation of the roof crown. This would include Kong Hwee’s installation charge, the supply of stainless bolts and washers and expenses incurred for the import and galvanising of the steel materials ordered from Qingdao Co. Such expenses would include import clearance charges, unstuffing (of containers) and delivery charges for the roof crown steel support.  A crane is definitely required for the roof crown installation and the court dismisses Pro-Active’s objection to the back charge of $22,078.31 in this regard as well as its objection to the charges for, amongst other things, the erection and dismantling of scaffolding for installation, amounting to $39,426.40.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The only items that the court does not accept as valid back charges are the medical fees incurred for Vaitilingam Padmanaban ($248.78) and Islam Anwarul ($701.28) and for the basic traffic control courses ($459.99) attended by several workers who were identified. No details or evidence were provided for these items.

</div>, it pointed out that its claim against Pro-Active has nothing to do with the issue of privity of contract. It is based on the fact that Pro-Active needed to pay for the installation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the roof crown works as long as Prime engaged another subcontractor to carry out that installation. It was not disputed that Kong Hwee did carry out those works, subject to the caveat that its appointment was done by Shimizu. Prime added that it makes no difference to Pro-Active whether Kong Hwee’s appointment was done by Shimizu or Positive or Prime as long as it was a subcontractor which was appointed to carry out the installation of the roof crown works which Pro-Active did not do.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 It is precisely because there is no privity of contract between main and subcontractors that the construction industry coined the words “back charges” and came up with the practice of the main contractor(s) charging its subcontractors for <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> rectification of defective works, provision of manpower and materials <span class="font-italic">etc</span> which the subcontractors pass down the line to sub-subcontractors and to the party ultimately liable for the back charge in question.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The correct computation for Pro-Active’s claim and/or the work it carried out is set out in the table below:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Item</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Particulars</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount (S$)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Revised Contract sum* </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1,161,210.58</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Add </span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Agreed variation works </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1,351,320.95</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Total </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2,512,531.53</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Less</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-Heading-8 text-left font-italic">(i) Advance payment $45,557.69</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(ii) L/C payment $765,875.00</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(iii) Progress payments $770,248.46</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(1,581,681.15)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(v) Allowed back charges (see [107] above), inclusive of charges associated with Kong Hwee’s installation work, and inclusive of GST </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">($751,699.34)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Balance</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$179,151.04</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">*The revised contract sum was accepted by both parties against the original figure in the LOA of $1,161,204.58. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In the Defence component of its D&amp;CC (see [30]<span class="font-italic"> </span>above), Prime had claimed $93,976.08

</div>, Pro-Active reserved its rights to seek costs from Prime for the late withdrawal of its counterclaim as well as the wasted hearing date of 9 December 2022 due to Andrew’s unavailability to attend court that day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Undoubtedly, a party that withdraws its clam or counterclaim at the eleventh hour is liable to pay costs to the other party. Should an exception be made in this case? The court is of the view that the evidence adduced in court would have likely supported a finding in favour of Prime of liability on Pro-Active’s part for liquidated damages as there was undoubtedly a delay in completion of the contracted works, even before the roof crown works were removed from Pro-Active’s scope of works. However, because of Prime’s intention not to pursue its counterclaim, no evidence was led in that regard other than the computation for liquidated damages set out in the D&amp;CC (see also [30] above)

That being the case, there should only be nominal costs awarded to Pro-Active for the withdrawal of Prime’s counterclaim which the court fixes at $3,000 plus another $2,000 for the wasted hearing day of 9 December 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Pro-Active on the other hand has not proven its claim. Instead of $558,559.97 (see [20]<span class="font-italic"> </span>above), Pro-Active is only entitled to the sum of $179,151.04.

Costs to Pro-Active are on the State/District Courts scale in view of the judgment sum awarded being below the jurisdiction of the High Court. The sum of $5,000 awarded to Pro-Active in [134] should be added to the costs here which are to be taxed on the State Courts scale unless otherwise agreed.   </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">Senior Judge</div></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yong Zhee Hoe and Remya Pisharath (Rajwin &amp; Yong LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Lee Wei Fan (Li Weifan) (Anthony Law Corporation) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
