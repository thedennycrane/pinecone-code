Therefore, the C&amp;C Letter, being from C&amp;C and not the Government, failed to comply with the terms of the Performance Bond. Sompo also argues that subrogation only extends to rights against the person responsible for the loss. In this case, the person responsible for the loss was Geometra and not Sompo. Accordingly, the C&amp;C Letter was not a valid demand on the Performance Bond, and as no valid demand was made before expiry on 18 March 2017, Sompo has no liability under it.

The doctrine of strict compliance ensures certainty, making it simple for the issuer to decide whether to honour the call. The issuer is not expected or entitled to exercise any discretion, but must reject the call if it does not strictly comply with the terms of the bond. One must construe the bond to determine what, if any, the formal requirements for the call are. The corollary of strict compliance is that formal requirements must be clearly stated on the face of and within the four corners of the bond so that those dealing with any call know exactly what must be complied with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In written submissions before me, Sompo contended that cl 1 of the Performance Bond, which obliged payment to be made “upon receipt of the Government’s first demand in writing”, established a formal requirement that the demand had to be issued by the Government.

</div>
</div> During oral argument, Sompo’s counsel clarified that he was not suggesting that a duly authorised agent could not make the call on behalf of the Government. This clarification was of course correctly made, because a government, like a corporation, must act through a natural person. Thus, even if a letter is issued on a government ministry’s letterhead, someone would sign it as the government’s agent. Sompo’s counsel confirmed that solicitors, if duly authorised by the Government, could make the call. I should add for completeness that the terms of a performance bond may, and sometimes do, stipulate who may make the call on behalf of a corporation or other entity, such as a requirement for the signature of two directors in the case of a corporation or the signature of a designated level of departmental officer in the case of a government. The Performance Bond makes no such stipulation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 After that clarification, Sompo’s argument on this point appears to be put as follows. Sompo’s counsel contends that insufficient evidence of authority, whether directly from the Government or via subrogation, had been provided at the time of the call. He argues that if the beneficiary’s agent makes the call, it must show proof of its authority. In this case, C&amp;C did not provide Sompo with any evidence of its authority to make the call on the Government’s behalf. It did not provide any warrant or other authority from the Government. On the other hand, if C&amp;C relied on RSA’s having been subrogated to the Government’s rights, it did not provide documents showing how it was entitled to exercise subrogated rights, such as evidence of the insurance contract or its payment thereunder. Indeed, C&amp;C did not provide any evidence of authority given to it by RSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This contention is not supported by the wording of the Performance Bond. The Performance Bond does not say that the demand must be accompanied by proof of authority of the person making the demand on the Government’s behalf. The only requirement is that the demand be in writing and “the Government’s”.

In that case, the bond was in favour of a protection and indemnity club, The Shipowners’ Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association (Luxembourg) (“the Club”), who was the defined obligee and who the bond described as “a legally representative [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] of Maridive &amp; Oil Services (S.A.E)” (“Maridive”). Payment on the bond was to be made upon written demand by the defined obligee. However, when the demand came to be made, the solicitors making it stated their client to be Maridive, and made no mention of the Club at all. This was held to be an invalid demand, even if Maridive was the principal of the Club, because the Club was the defined obligee. This case does not however assist Sompo, because in the present case the solicitors making the demand correctly identified the Singapore Government as the beneficiary of the bond and expressly made the demand on its behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Sompo also relies on an email that DSTA sent to C&amp;C on 14 June 2017 about three months after the C&amp;C Letter to suggest that neither RSA nor C&amp;C had authorisation to make the call on the Performance Bond.

</div>
</div> This email does not assist Sompo’s contention. C&amp;C never purported to act for the Government under express authority. Rather, they derived their authority from RSA, which by virtue of the doctrine of subrogation was entitled to use the Singapore Government’s name for the call on the Performance Bond even without the Government giving consent for this specific use. As explained below, the subrogor impliedly promises to allow the use of his name for the pursuit of rights of action to which the subrogee becomes subrogated. Even if the subrogor wishes to resile from that promise, it is specifically enforceable in equity. In any case, the email does not in any way derogate from RSA’s rights as subrogee, but expressly affirms those rights. Subrogation occurs automatically upon indemnification of the insured’s loss, and requires no other positive act from either the insured or the insurer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I also reject Sompo’s argument that the call had to be accompanied by evidence of subrogation. There is nothing in the terms of the Performance Bond requiring this. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The extent of subrogation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The second issue is whether RSA was subrogated to the Government’s rights on the performance bond. Sompo’s contention principally rests on an apparent qualification concerning those rights of the insured to which the insurer is subrogated that may be found in many of the textbook extracts and cases cited to me, to the effect that those rights are against a person responsible for the insured loss. For example, Robert Merkin, <span class="font-italic">Colinvaux</span><span class="font-italic">’s Law of Insurance</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Colinvaux</span>”) states at para 12-004: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While the negative side of subrogation is generally emphasised by the courts, subrogation has an equally important “positive” side. The insurers are entitled to take over all of the rights of the assured, whether in contract or tort, legal or equitable, <span class="font-italic">against the person responsible for the loss</span>, and are also entitled to take advantage of any benefit which accrues to the assured which diminishes the loss. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 RSA’s counsel rejects this qualification. She relies on the wording of s 79(2) of the Marine Insurance Act (c 41) (UK), which contains no such qualification and instead refers to “all rights and remedies of the assured in and in respect of the subject-matter insured”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 RSA’s counsel also relies on the next part of the extract from <span class="font-italic">Colinvaux</span>, cited at [29] above, namely the entitlement “to take advantage of any benefit which accrues to the assured that diminishes the loss”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As with any consideration of the common law, the exercise lies not merely in parsing the words of judgments or textbooks but in understanding the principles underlying those words. It is important to consider the juridical basis of the law of subrogation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I refer to the common law, because one must keep in mind that s 79 of the Marine Insurance Act (whether UK or Singapore) is not an exhaustive statement of the law of subrogation to be applied to marine insurance. Rather, it provides statutory recognition that the common law doctrine of subrogation applies to marine insurance contracts. As observed in F D Rose, <span class="font-italic">Marine </span><span class="font-italic">Insurance: Law and Practice </span>(Informa, 2nd Ed, 2012) at para 27.13, one must find the detail of that doctrine in the common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The doctrine of subrogation in the context of indemnity insurance arose from the implication by the common law of terms in the contract of indemnity insurance that prevent the insured from recovering more than an indemnity. A contract that permitted the insured to make a profit from the occurrence of an event would begin to resemble a wager, a transaction which the common law did not favour. As noted in John Birds, Ben Lynch &amp; Simon Milnes, <span class="font-italic">MacGillivray on Insurance Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2012) para 23<span class="font-weight-bold">–</span>001, “the fundamental principle of indemnity insurance [is] that the assured shall receive no more than a full indemnity for his real loss, and must not be permitted to make a profit out of being insured”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 By terms implied in the contract of indemnity insurance, the insured promises to take specific steps or actions so that he will not be overcompensated and the insurer’s interest in paying only for the insured’s actual loss is protected. Primarily, this is a matter between insured and insurer. However, to be effectively enforced, these implied contractual promises may in some aspects have to be recognised or given effect to in relation to third parties, and for this purpose equity steps in to confer on the insurer an equitable interest in the insured’s rights of action against third parties in respect of the subject-matter of the loss. Lord Templeman explained the juridical basis of the law of subrogation in his speech in the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Lord </span><span class="font-italic">Napier and Ettrick and another v Hunter and others</span> [1993] AC 713 at 736:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It may be that the common law invented and implied in contracts of insurance a promise by the insured person to take proceedings to reduce his loss, a promise by the insured person to account to the insurer for moneys recovered from a third party in respect of the insured loss and a promise by the insured person to allow the insurer to exercise in the name of the insured person rights of action vested in the insured person against third parties for the recovery of the insured loss if the insured person refuses or neglects to enforce those rights of action. There must also be implied a promise by the insured person that in exercising his rights of action against third parties he will act in good faith for the benefit of the insured person so far as he has borne the loss and for the benefit of the insurer so far as he has indemnified the insured person against the insured loss. My Lords, contractual promises may create equitable interests. An express promise by a vendor to convey land on payment of the purchase price confers on the purchaser an equitable interest in the land. In my opinion promises implied in a contract of insurance with regard to rights of action vested in the insured person for the recovery of an insured loss from a third party responsible for the loss confer on the insurer an equitable interest in those rights of action to the extent necessary to recoup the insurer who has indemnified the insured person against the insured loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Understanding the law of subrogation in this way elucidates how it applies in various situations. For example, as the right of subrogation is implied by law into the indemnity insurance contract it can be expressly excluded or limited by that contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The doctrine of subrogation has been classically described by Brett LJ in <span class="font-italic">Castellain v Preston</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1883] 11 QBD 380, at 388:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… as between the underwriter and the assured the underwriter is entitled to the advantage of every right of the assured, whether such a right consists in contract, fulfilled or unfulfilled, or in remedy for tort capable of being insisted on or already insisted on, or in any other right, whether by way of condition or otherwise, legal or equitable, which can be, or has been exercised or has accrued, and whether such right could or could not be enforced by the insurer in the name of the assured by the exercise or acquiring of which right or condition the loss against which the assured is insured, can be, or has been diminished. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Turning to the question raised in this appeal, it can be answered by considering what the relationship of the Performance Bond is to the insured loss. The Performance Bond relates to the loss suffered by the Government from breach of the Carriage Contract, and it is that same loss which is insured. Calling on the Performance Bond was a remedy available to the Government that if taken would have reduced the loss. Hence if the Performance Bond had been called upon prior to the making of the insurance claim, RSA would only have paid the Government in respect of any part of the insured loss that was not already covered by the pay out under the bond. If the Government made its insurance claim first and was paid out on that, but then subsequently called upon the Performance Bond, it would be accountable to the insurer for any proceeds it might receive under the Performance Bond. This follows straightforwardly from the principle that the insured cannot by the indemnity insurance contract obtain more than he has lost, and once he has received payment under the Performance Bond his loss has reduced by that amount. It is a benefit that has accrued to the insured that diminishes his loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It follows that the insurer, upon payment to the insured, is subrogated to the insured’s rights even on a contract, such as the Performance Bond, that is given not by the person responsible for the loss but by someone else, so long as that contract concerns the subject-matter of the insured loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This result accords with the policy concern of the law that risks are allocated to those best able to evaluate them and adopt measures of risk reduction or mitigation. The issuer of a performance bond has the opportunity prior to issuing it to evaluate the creditworthiness of the principal and – if thought prudent – to obtain security from that principal. By comparison, the insurer has less opportunity to assess the creditworthiness of its insured’s contractual counterparties, and even if it did would have only blunter and less effective tools at its disposal for the purpose of controlling or mitigating that risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Sompo contends in this appeal that the insurer should be limited to pursuing its subrogated rights against Geometra. That is not correct. RSA has the option to pursue its subrogated rights against Geometra or against Sompo, just as the Government did. It is no answer to tell the subrogated insurer to pursue a different remedy any more than it would be an answer to the insured. Both insured and insurer have the choice of remedy. Of course, once Sompo has paid on the Performance Bond, it has the right to look to its principal, Geometra, including by reference to any security that it obtained prior to issuing the Performance Bond.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 An insurer’s right of subrogation to the rights and remedies of the insured in respect of the subject matter of the loss extends to the right to call upon a performance bond provided to the insured by a third party in connection with the insured’s original contract with the party responsible for the insured loss. As RSA by its solicitors made a valid call in the name of the Government on the Performance Bond prior to its expiry, Sompo must pay RSA in accordance with that call. I dismiss the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Costs should follow the event, and I fix the costs of the appeal to be paid by Sompo to RSA at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judicial Commissioner </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Govintharasah s/o Ramanathan, Sharma Neharika and Beverly Nah (Gurbani &amp; Co LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Wan Chee and Ng Tse Jun Russell (Rev Law LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
