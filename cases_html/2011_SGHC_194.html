<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Applicant is the next-of-kin of the deceased
                    Mr Poon Wai Tong (the “Deceased”). She lodged a claim for
                    compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“WICA”) in respect of the death of the Deceased. Wartsila
                    Singapore Pte Ltd (the “1st Respondent”) was the employer of the
                    Deceased which had obtained workmen’s compensation insurance cover from
                    India International Insurance Pte Ltd (the “2nd Respondent”). The
                    1st Respondent did not contest the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Deceased passed away in Cambodia on
                    1 September 2008 in a hotel room at around 11am, Cambodia time. No autopsy
                    was performed and the death certificate registered on 2 September 2008 in
                    Daun Penh District, Cambodia, did not contain any cause of death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By a Notice of Assessment dated 25 May
                    2009, the Commissioner for Labour (the “Commissioner”) assessed
                    that no compensation was payable because death was not caused by an accident
                    arising out of and in the course of employment. The Applicant lodged an
                    objection to this Notice of Assessment and at the conclusion of the hearing of
                    the matter, the Commissioner maintained the position taken in the assessment.
                    The present application by way of this originating summons is an appeal against
                    the Commissioner’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The facts of this case are not in dispute. The
                    Deceased was employed as a general manager by the 1st Respondent since
                    2 January 1987. As a general manager, he reported directly to the managing
                    director of the company, one Mr Ong Ban Leong (“Ong”). The
                    Deceased was required in the course of his employment to work outside Singapore
                    periodically. Ong confirmed that he had travelled many times with the Deceased
                    on business trips.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ong gave evidence that the Deceased’s
                    travelling itinerary for this particular trip included travelling to Phnom Penh,
                    Bangkok, Hanoi and Ho Chih Minh City. Phnom Penh, Cambodia was the first stop of
                    the business trip which was scheduled to last from 31 August 2008 to
                    5 September 2008. The Deceased was in Phnom Penh to attend, among other
                    things, an anniversary dinner of Khmer Electrical Power (“KEP”) on
                    31 August 2008 (as representative of the 1st Respondent) and more
                    importantly, a meeting on 1 September 2008 to discuss a debt owed by KEP to
                    the 1st Respondent. Upon arrival in Phnom Penh on 31 August 2008, the
                    Deceased was met by the 1st Respondent’s representative in Cambodia,
                    Mr Jonathan Lim Balayan (“Lim”). Lim and the Deceased parted
                    ways at the airport, agreeing to meet at the anniversary dinner later that
                    evening. From the airport, the Deceased drove a company car (owned by the 1st
                    Respondent) to Phnom Penh Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the anniversary dinner, Lim suggested that
                    the Deceased meet with Cambodia Brewery Ltd (“CBL”) as it could be
                    a potential client of the 1st Respondent. The Deceased agreed to meet CBL the
                    next day before the scheduled meeting with KEP at 11am. Lim arranged to pick up
                    the Deceased from Phnom Penh Hotel at 9am the next morning for the meeting with
                    CBL. The hotel’s Surveillance Department’s report showed that the
                    Deceased returned to his room alone at 1.31am on 1 September 2008 and that
                    no one else entered the room from then until 10.58am.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On the morning of 1 September 2008, Lim was
                    in office completing a report for his superior. As a result, Lim was late in
                    leaving his office to pick up the Deceased from Phnom Penh Hotel. At about
                    9.45am, after Lim had left his office, he received a call from the Deceased but
                    hung up on the call as he did not hear any voice on the line. At about 10.20am,
                    when Lim was already driving towards Phnom Penh Hotel, he received another call
                    from the Deceased asking for medical assistance as the Deceased was having
                    difficulty breathing. Sometime between 10.30am and 10.45am, Lim reached Phnom
                    Penh Hotel and subsequently managed to open the Deceased’s room door with
                    the assistance of the hotel staff. Upon entry into the room, the Deceased was
                    found dead. He was clad in shorts and an undershirt with his upper body on the
                    bed and his legs on the floor at the end of the bed. A pair of trousers was hung
                    on the chair next to a table. A laptop was found on that table, although Lim
                    could not confirm whether the laptop was turned on at that time. Lim also
                    testified that there were no personal items around the room and suggested that
                    it appeared as if the Deceased was ready to check out of the room.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Commissioner’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After hearing the evidence adduced at the
                    hearing, the Commissioner found that the Deceased’s death did not arise
                    out of and in the course of his employment with the 1st Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Commissioner, there was no evidence that the Deceased was involved in any work
                    prior to his death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner took into
                    consideration the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">No work-related emails were received that
                                morning;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Although the Deceased had made phone calls
                            requesting medical assistance, these phone calls did not seem to arise
                            out of any work related to any of the meetings that the Deceased was to
                            attend that morning;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There was no evidence on any presentation or
                            preliminary discussion with regard to the intended meeting with the
                            potential client, CBL;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If the Deceased had been working, he would
                            probably have prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP.
                            The fact that there was no evidence of any of these documents present
                            when the Deceased was found in the hotel room suggested that he had not
                            been working at the material time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Based on the above evidence, the Commissioner
                    held that the Deceased was merely waiting for Lim to pick him up for the
                    meetings with CBL and KEP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner was
                    accordingly of the view that the Deceased was in a position similar to someone
                    waiting at home for transport to arrive to bring him to office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner held that
                    this was <em>not</em> to be considered as being in the
                    course of employment, referring to the decision of Lai Siu Chiu JC in
                        <em>QBE Insurance (International) Ltd v Julaiha Bee Bee and
                        others</em> [1992] 1 SLR 406 (“<em>QBE
                        Insurance</em>”) at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The paramount rule is that an employee travelling on the highway will be
                        acting in the course of his employment if, and only if, he is at the
                        material time going about his employer’s business. <em>One must not confuse the duty to turn up for one’s work with the
                            concept of already being ‘on duty’ while travelling to
                            it</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Commissioner also pointed out that in
                        <em>Ma Kit Ching Veronica v Attorney General</em>
                    [1983] 1 HKC 470, Deputy Judge Grindey held that an employee cannot
                    claim compensation if at the time of the accident he had finished his duty for
                    the day, in other words, when he had “clocked off”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In the Commissioner’s
                    view, the Deceased would have “clocked on” only when he was
                    present at a work-related meeting, not when he was waiting for transport
                        (<em>ie</em> Lim) to arrive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Commissioner further considered the
                    presumption provided in s 3(6) of the WICA and found that it was not
                    applicable and therefore the burden of the Appellant to prove the claim did not
                    shift to the 2nd Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Section 3(6) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an
                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to
                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the Commissioner’s view, s 3(6) may only be invoked
                    where it is certain that the accident occurred <em>in the course
                        of employment</em>, but it was uncertain as to whether the <em>accident arose out of that employment</em> in this
                        case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In a case where there was
                    uncertainty as to whether the accident even occurred in the course of employment
                    in the first place, s 3(6) of the WICA would not apply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In making this decision, the
                    Commissioner relied on the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J in <em>Karuppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028 (“<em>Karuppiah</em>”) at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The presumption in s 3(6) does not arise whenever a worker is injured
                        in an accident. It applies to accidents arising in the course of his
                        employment. When the Commissioner found that the accident did not arise in
                        the course of the applicant’s employment, the presumption in
                        s 3(6) did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts as found by the Commissioner, the Commissioner held that
                    the presumption in s 3(6) did not arise because the accident could not be
                    said to have arisen in the course of the Deceased’s
                employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     An employer’s liability for compensation
                    is imposed by s 3(1) of the WICA, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-1">By virtue of s 2(4), the WICA applies to an accident happening to
                    an employee outside Singapore where the employee is ordinarily resident in
                    Singapore and is employed by an employer in Singapore but is required in the
                    course of his employment to work outside Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Under s 3(1), an employee has to prove
                    three elements before establishing an employer’s liability for

                            the purposes of s 3(1) of the WICA; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the accident arose out of and in the
                            course of employment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the
                        WICA.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before turning to address the issues proper,
                    however, it is prudent to first address the preliminary point on whether the
                    Appellant has a right to appeal to the High Court on the two main
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary issue: appeals from the Commissioner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     An appeal to the High Court from a decision of
                    the Commissioner made under the WICA is possible only where a
                    “substantial question of law is involved in the appeal” and
                    “the amount in dispute is not less than $1,000” (s 29(2A) of
                    the WICA). Section 29 of the WICA is reproduced here for
                    convenience:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Appeal from decision of
                            Commissioner</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29. —(1) Subject to section 24(3B), any person aggrieved by any
                        order of the Commissioner made under this Act may appeal to the High Court
                        whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Subject to the Rules of Court, the procedure in an appeal to the High
                        Court shall be the procedure in a civil appeal from a District Court with
                        such modifications as the circumstances may require.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless a <em>substantial question of law</em> is involved in the appeal and
                        the <em>amount in dispute is not less than
                        $1,000</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Notwithstanding any appeal under this section, the employer shall
                        deposit with the Commissioner the amount of compensation ordered by the
                        Commissioner under section 25B, 25C or 25D within 21 days from the date of
                        the Commissioner’s decision, and the deposit shall be held by the
                        Commissioner pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The parties in the present case did not raise
                    any issues regarding s 29(2A), implying that they agreed that substantial
                    questions of law were involved in the present appeal. Nonetheless, for
                    completeness, I turn to make some brief observations on the right of appeal to
                    the High Court from a decision of the Commissioner and to assess whether there
                    were indeed substantial questions of law raised in the present
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Several precedent decisions of this court have
                    elaborated on the requirement of a “substantive question of law”
                    in s 29(2A). Section 29(2A) reflects the policy that decisions of the
                    Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are decisions of a court of
                    law (<em>Karuppiah</em> at [9]), as evinced through Parliamentary debates which state the
                    intention of the WICA is to provide “a simpler and quicker way to settle
                    compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal proceedings” (<em>Allianz Insurance</em> at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It should be noted that the “question
                    of law” test for appeals from decisions of statutory tribunals (such as
                    the Commissioner in the present case) is different from that for appeals from
                    arbitrators, since as a matter of policy, there must be a greater degree of
                    judicial supervision over the former (<em>Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon
                        Samuel Bernard</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“<em>Ng Swee Lang</em>”) at [24] and [25], <em>Karuppiah</em> at [14] and <em>Selvam Raju v Camelron General
                        Contractors and another</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1113
                        (“<em>Selvam Raju</em>”) at [7]). In determining the range of errors of law
                    that may provide grounds for appeal under s 29(2A), the courts have
                    accepted the full range of errors of law listed in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed
                    Reissue, 1989) at paragraph 70:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule
                        of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking
                        irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant
                        considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts;
                        admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant
                        evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal
                        principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which
                        are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting
                        oneself as to the burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition, the courts have accepted Lord
                    Radcliffe’s statement in <em>Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v
                        Bairstow</em> [1956] AC 14 at 36 that a factual finding
                    which was such that “no person acting judicially and properly instructed
                    as to the relevant law could have come to the determination upon appeal”
                    amounted to a misconception or error in point of law (<em>Karuppiah</em> at [13],
                        <em>Selvam Raju</em> at [7]). However, not every wrong finding of fact would amount to a
                    substantial question of law. In the final analysis, the nature and effect of the
                    error will be considered and such errors must have a bearing on the ultimate
                    decision (<em>Karuppiah</em> at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Turning to the two main issues on appeal in
                    the present case (see above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>), it is
                    clear that both involve “substantial questions of law” as defined
                    in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> and <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above. Both issues involve statutory interpretation of
                    s 3(1) of the WICA (especially the terms “accident” and
                    “course of employment”). They also deal with inferences drawn by
                    the Commissioner from the facts that the Commissioner had found. While the court
                    will not generally disturb findings of facts unless they are such that
                    “no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant
                    law could have come to the determination upon appeal” (<em>Karuppiah</em> at [13]),
                    there is no similar rule precluding courts from assessing the robustness of
                    inferences drawn from the facts as found by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having stated that this is a case where the
                    issues raised are appealable to the High Court, I turn now to address the two
                    issues involved in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was an “accident” for the purposes of
                s 3(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the issue of whether there was an
                    “accident” for the purposes of s 3(1), it is apposite to
                    refer to <em>Narayasamy</em>, where Menon JC
                    interpreted the meaning of “accident” by drawing from the House of
                    Lords’ interpretation of the equivalent English statute (which is
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with s 3(1) of the WICA).
                    The relevant passages from <em>Narayasamy</em> are
                    reproduced here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23 Lord Loreburn LC, speaking in the majority, first
                        considered whether this could be described as an accident and held that it
                        could following the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Fenton v Thorley &amp; Co
                        Ltd</em> [1903] AC 443. His Lordship noted as follows
                        at 245-246:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The first question here is whether or not the learned judge was
                            entitled to regard the rupture as an "accident" within the meaning of
                            this Act. In my opinion, he was so entitled. Certainly it was an
                            "untoward event." It was not designed. It was unexpected in what seems
                            to me the relevant sense, namely, that a sensible man who knew the
                            nature of the work would not have expected it. I cannot agree with the
                            argument presented to your Lordships that you are to ask whether a
                            doctor acquainted with the man's condition would have expected it. Were
                            that the right view, then it would not be an accident if a man very
                            liable to fainting fits fell in a faint from a ladder and hurt himself.
                            No doubt the ordinary accident is associated with something external;
                            the bursting of a boiler, or an explosion in a mine, for example. But it
                            may be merely from the main's own miscalculation, such as tripping and
                            falling. Or it may be due both to internal and external conditions, as
                            if a seaman were to faint in the rigging and tumble into the sea. I
                            think it may also be something going wrong within the human frame
                            itself, such as the straining of a muscle or the breaking of a blood
                            vessel. If that occurred when he was lifting a weight it would be
                            properly described as an accident. So, I think, rupturing an aneurism
                            when tightening a nut with a spanner may be regarded as an
                            accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24 It is thus apparent that an "accident" within the meaning of the
                        English statute (which is in <em>pari materia</em> with
                        s 3(1) of the Act) <b><em>would include an internal
                            medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was
                            carrying out his work</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The parties agreed on the interpretation of
                    “accident” as adopted in <em>Narayasamy</em>,
                        <em>viz</em>, that it would “include an internal
                    medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman was
                    carrying out his work”. The parties agreed that the Deceased had died
                    from circumstances that resembled a cardiac arrest and further agreed that if
                    the death was <em>indeed</em> caused by cardiac arrest, it
                    would be considered, on the authority of <em>Narayasamy</em>, to be caused by an “accident” within
                    the meaning of s 3(1). The only dispute concerning the requirement of an
                    “accident” stemmed from the 2nd Respondent’s argument that
                    since the <em>precise cause of death</em> was not proved by
                    the Appellant, it could not be said that the Deceased’s death had been
                    caused by an “accident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Considering the circumstantial evidence that
                    is available, namely, the phone calls made by the Deceased and, in particular, a
                    phone call seeking medical assistance for breathing difficulties (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), I am of the view that the death was, on
                    a balance of probabilities, caused by cardiac arrest. Accordingly, I find that
                    the Deceased’s death was caused by an “accident” within the
                    meaning of s 3(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At this juncture, I pause to record several
                    observations on the use of the term “accident” in s 3(1). The
                    word “accident” is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary to
                    mean “an <em>unfortunate incident</em> that happens
                        <em>unexpectedly</em> and <em>unintentionally</em>, typically resulting in damage or injury”
                    (emphasis added).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This definition would, at
                    least on a literal reading, allow the word “accident” to include
                    – as the court in <em>Narayasamy</em> held – an
                    internal medical condition that caused an unexpected injury while the workman
                    was carrying out his work”. It could of course be argued that it is not
                    in line with the common understanding of the word “accident” to
                    include something which happens as a result of a person’s “internal
                    medical condition”. Some may accordingly view <em>Narayasamy</em> as providing an overly broad interpretation of
                    “accident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I sympathise with those who think that the
                    word “accident” had been stretched beyond its common usage in
                        <em>Narayasamy</em>. Nonetheless, in my view, the
                    liberal interpretation of “accident” adopted in <em>Narayasamy</em> is justified. It is clear that s 9A of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) enjoins courts to prefer an
                    interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying any particular
                    legislation. The WICA describes itself as being “[a]n Act relating to the
                    payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their
                    employment”. Being a piece of social legislation, the WICA should be
                    interpreted purposively in favour of employees who have suffered injury during
                    their employment. The <em>Narayasamy</em> interpretation is
                    therefore entirely in line with the purpose of the WICA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     An interesting point to note is the
                    relationship between ss 3(1) and 3(5) of the WICA, stemming from the use of
                    the word “accident” in the former. Section 3(1) has been set
                    out at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above. Section 3(5) of the
                    WICA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) An employer shall not be liable to pay compensation in
                        respect of —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) any injury to an employee resulting from an accident if it is
                            proved that the injury to the employee is directly attributable to the
                            employee having been at the time thereof under the influence of alcohol
                            or a drug not prescribed by a medical practitioner; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) any incapacity or death resulting from a deliberate self-injury or
                            the deliberate aggravation of an accidental injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     To recap, s 3(1) is the gateway to
                    liability under s 3 of the WICA; the three elements of s 3(1), the
                    second of which being that the injury must have been caused by an
                    “accident”, must be fulfilled before an employer is liable to pay
                    compensation to an employee. However, s 3(5)(b) excludes an
                    employer’s liability for “any incapacity or death resulting from a
                        <em>deliberate self-injury</em> …”
                    (emphasis added). It is difficult to see how a particular claim could pass
                    through the s 3(1) gateway but subsequently be excluded by virtue of
                    s 3(5)(b), since a “deliberate self-injury” could hardly be
                    considered an “accident” in the first place. Of course, one way to
                    rationalise the provisions is to interpret the “deliberate
                    self-injury” component of s 3(5)(b) as dealing with a class of cases
                    that does not fall within s 3(1) in the first place but if that were the
                    case, then s 3(5)(b) would not be necessary since there is no liability
                    apart from s 3(1). An “accident” which is proved to have been
                    faked or planned would be no accident at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The situation in relation to ss 3(1) and
                    3(5) may be avoided if the term “accident” (which already connotes
                    something unintentional) is replaced by a more general term, for instance,
                    “incident” (which is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary to
                    mean “an instance of something happening; an event or
                        occurrence”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The “deliberate
                    self-injury” (referred to in s 3(5)(b)) would be an
                    “incident” although it is not an
                “accident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In addition, replacing the word
                    “accident” in the WICA with “incident” (or some
                    other suitable term) would, I think, be more palatable to linguistic purists who
                    may object quite legitimately to describing someone who suffered a heart attack
                    as having had an “accident”. It would obviate the need for an
                    expansive or over liberal meaning to be given to the word
                    “accident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the accident arose out of and in the “course of the
                employment”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The next issue (which is also the main issue
                    in dispute in the present case) is whether the accident arose in the
                    “course of the employment”. This is a requirement to be met before
                    liability can be established under s 3(1) of the WICA. The parties agreed
                    that if the accident was found to have arisen in the “course of
                    employment”, then it would, pursuant to s 3(6) of the WICA, be
                    deemed to have arisen out of that employment. To repeat, s 3(6)
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of this Act, an accident arising in the course of an
                        employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to
                        the contrary, to have arisen out of that employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the parties are agreed that all that is required in
                    the present case is to determine whether the accident arose in the
                    “course of employment” since there is no contradicting
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As noted at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the Commissioner relied on the case of <em>QBE Insurance</em> in determining that the Deceased, while
                    waiting for Lim’s transport, was not in the course of employment. The
                    House of Lords’ decision in <em>Charles R Davidson and
                        Company v M’Robb or Officer</em> [1918] AC 304
                        (“<em>Davidson</em>”) is instructive and
                    it is apposite to reproduce extracts of the judgments of three of the learned
                    Law Lords in that case. I begin with the dissenting opinion of Lord
                    Finlay LC (at 314-315):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In the course of the employment” must mean, similarly, in
                        the <em>course of the work which the man is employed to do,
                            and what is incident to it</em> – in other words, in the
                        course of his service. In the case of a domestic servant who sleeps and
                        takes his meals in his master’s house he is in the course of his
                        service all the time – his service is interrupted if he goes out on
                        his own business or pleasure. A workman who by the terms of his employment
                        takes his meals on his employer’s premises is in the course of his
                        service in being there at meal-times. In either case the master or employer
                        would be liable for damage caused by such an accident…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>“In the course of the employment” does
                            not mean during the currency of the time of the engagement</em>.
                        If the words meant this they would be useless, and would add nothing to the
                        words “arising out of the employment,” while to interpret them
                        in this sense would let in the possibility of a number of claims of the
                        nature above indicated which the words “in the course of the
                        employment” rightly read as meaning in the course of the work or
                        service would exclude. If “in the course of the employment”
                        meant during the currency of the engagement a sailor engaged for a round
                        voyage would be in the course of his employment while in a public-house in
                        any port where he had leave to go on shore. <em>“Course” is more applicable to work or service than to
                            the currency of the engagement. Leave on shore on the sailor’s own
                            business or pleasure is an interruption of his employment, not in the
                            course of it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Dunedin noted (at 321) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In my view “in the course of employment” is a
                        different thing from “during the period of employment.” It
                        connotes, to my mind, the idea that the workman or servant is doing
                        something which is part of his service to his employer or master. <em>No doubt it need not be actual work, but it must, I think, be
                            work, or the natural incidents connected with the class of
                            work</em> – e.g., in the workman’s case the taking of
                        meals during the hours of labour; in the servant’s, not only the
                        taking of meals, but <em>resting and sleeping</em>,
                        which follow from the fact that domestic servants generally live and sleep
                        under the master’s roof. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Atkinson provided further guidance on determining whether an
                    employee was “in the course of employment” at the material time
                    (at 327):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The words “in course of his employment” mean, I
                        think, while the workman is doing something he is employed to do. In the
                        case of a sailor who lives on board his ship, or an indoor servant who lives
                        in his master’s house, these words would of course cover and include
                        things <em>necessarily incidental to his service there
                            – such as taking his meals, sleeping, resting, &amp;c</em>.
                        In satisfying these demands of nature the sailor is as truly doing something
                        within the course of his employment as he would be in keeping a look-out or
                        going aloft. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It should be noted that in <em>Allianz Insurance</em>, Lai JC cited Lord
                    Findlay LC’s dicta in <em>Davidson</em> with
                    approval and went on to find that the deceased in <em>Allianz
                        Insurance</em> was within the course of his employment despite being
                    on a break after his shift had ended and despite there being no evidence that he
                    was actually doing work at the time of death. The present case is concerned with
                    a situation in which an employee is sent overseas on a business trip.
                    Accordingly, I limit my observations to the context of employees going on
                    overseas working trips. One possible interpretation is that an employee on an
                    overseas working trip is considered to be in the “course of
                    employment” for the <em>entire period</em> that he
                    is overseas. Another possible interpretation is that the employee is considered
                    to be in the “course of employment” only during the time that he
                    is actively at work, and not, for instance, when he is having meals or sleeping.
                    To my mind, however, both interpretations are extreme and cannot represent the
                    law with regard to the “course of employment” under s 3(1) of
                    the WICA. The former interpretation is clearly too broad. It would, for
                    instance, render an employer liable for an employee’s injury where the
                    employee chooses to do extreme sports on a free day between business meetings.
                    Such an action by the employee would, to borrow Lord Finlay LC’s words, be
                    “an <em>interruption</em> of his employment, not in
                    the course of it” (emphasis added). In contrast, the latter
                    interpretation is clearly too narrow. It would, for instance, render an employee
                    without compensation simply because he had been taking a breather from work when
                    tragedy struck. Such an interpretation would starkly contradict the opinions of
                    Lords Dunedin and Atkinson, that “natural [or necessary]
                    incidents” connected to work would fall within the course of employment
                    as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my opinion, the proper approach to take
                    falls somewhere between the extreme approaches outlined in the preceding
                    paragraph. Some examples will be useful to illustrate the necessity of a
                    fact-sensitive approach in determining whether an employee was in the
                    “course of employment” at the material time. In some cases, it is
                    reasonably clear that the employee is not in the course of employment when he
                    suffered the injury. For instance, if an employee travels on a working trip to
                    London and thereafter heads to Paris for a vacation before returning, any injury
                    occasioned during the period of time when he is in Paris would not be in the
                    course of employment – his presence in Paris cannot generally be said to
                    be <em>incidental</em> to his work. There are, however,
                    situations which are less clear. Take the example of an employee who travels for
                    a working trip that involves numerous meetings and little time for leisure
                    activities; <em>prima facie</em>, the entire trip would be
                    considered to be in the course of employment, since his presence overseas may be
                    said to be “necessarily incidental” to his work. However, if the
                    employee chooses to go bungee jumping during a period of free time between
                    meetings and injures himself in the process, this would probably not be
                    sufficiently <em>incidental</em> to the course of work and
                    accordingly constitutes a “frolic of the employee’s own”, a
                    “deviation” from or an “interruption” to the course
                    of employment. On the other hand, if there was evidence that the employee had
                    gone bungee jumping for the purposes of building business relations with a
                    particular client, then it could conceivably be argued that the injury from
                    bungee jumping was caused in the course of employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The process of determining whether an employee
                    was, at the material time of suffering injury, in the “course of
                    employment”, is a <em>highly factual inquiry</em>.
                    An analogy may be made with tort cases relating to whether an employer is
                    vicariously liable for acts done by an employee in the course of employment.
                    From those cases, it is clear that whether a detour by an employee is a
                    “frolic of his own” or is conversely in the course of employment,
                    is a matter of fact and degree (see <em>eg Joel v
                        Morison</em> (1834) 6 C&amp;P 501, <em>Whatman v Pearson</em> (1868) LR 3 CP 422 and
                        <em>Storey v Ashton</em> (1869)
                    LR 4 QB 476). In my view, the factual nature of the test applies
                    equally in the context of determining whether, for purposes of work injury
                    compensation, the employee concerned was “in the course of
                    employment” when injury was suffered. It is neither helpful nor
                    appropriate for courts to attempt to phrase a precise legal test to govern all
                    situations, given that the question whether an employee was in the
                    “course of employment” is essentially a fact-specific inquiry.
                    Indeed, this brings to mind a recent exhortation of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Shadrake Alan v PP</em> [2011] SGCA 26 at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>, albeit in a very different
                    context, that “seeking to elaborate upon a legal test whose efficacy is
                    to be demonstrated more in its <em>application</em> rather
                    than its theoretical elaboration is, with respect, perhaps an approach that
                    should be avoided” (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I would specifically mention one consideration
                    to be taken into account when determining whether, as a matter of fact, the
                    employee was in the “course of employment” at the material time. I
                    have earlier (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above) alluded to the
                    fact that the WICA is social legislation which should be interpreted purposively
                    in favour of employees who have suffered injury during their employment. The
                    WICA must continue to be relevant to the realities of contemporary working
                    environments and conditions. Increasingly, work is no longer confined to
                    specific places and times, especially for white-collar employees (such as the
                    Deceased). Accordingly, the concept of being in the “course of
                    employment” must accommodate and reflect these changes in modern working
                    life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Returning to the facts of the present case, it
                    should be noted that it was undisputed that the <em>entire trip
                        was a working trip</em>. No leisure activities were planned. Indeed,
                    on the very day that the Deceased landed in Phnom Penh, he attended KEP’s
                    anniversary dinner as a representative of the 1st Respondent. The next morning,
                    he was going to meet with CBL for business matters and thereafter with KEP for
                    an important meeting to resolve financial issues. The very afternoon after the
                    meeting with KEP, the Deceased was scheduled to fly to Bangkok for further
                    work-related purposes. There was no “interruption” whatsoever that
                    brings the case outside the <em>prima facie</em> position
                    that the Deceased was in the “course of employment” at the
                    material time. Indeed, the Deceased’s being in his hotel room on the
                    fateful morning was <em>necessarily incidental</em> to his
                    work for the 1st<sup></sup>Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Even if leisure activities were included as
                    part of the programme, so long as they were sanctioned by the employer, they
                    would not amount to a break in employment. This accords with present day working
                    life where leisure, team-building and morale-boosting activities are part and
                    parcel of employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I accept the Commissioner’s findings
                    that there was no evidence of work-related emails or that the Deceased had
                    prepared the documents necessary for discussion with KEP when he was found at
                    11am that fateful morning. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the fact that
                    there was no <em>actual work</em> at that point in time
                    does not mean that the Deceased could not be considered to have been in the
                    course of employment (see the judgments of Lords Dunedin and Atkinson in
                        <em>Davidson</em>, reproduced at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). Indeed, I note that the
                    Deceased’s employers fully recognised and accepted that the Deceased died
                    in the course of employment. Ong gave uncontroverted evidence that the Deceased
                    was “a very disciplined and professional man” and that from his
                    experience of working with the Deceased for over 20 years, including travelling
                    with him on several business trips, he was certain that the Deceased would have
                    spent the morning of 1 September 2010 preparing himself for the meeting
                    with KEP. That is something entirely reasonable in the circumstances of this
                    case and perhaps in most cases of overseas work trips as well, especially those
                    with a demanding schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the circumstances, I find that the Deceased
                    suffered what appeared highly likely to be a cardiac arrest in the
                    “course of employment”. By virtue of s 3(6), the accident
                    would be deemed to have arisen out of the Deceased’s employment (see
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the reasons given above, I find that the
                    requirements under s 3(1) of the WICA were made out and the
                    employer’s liability was established. The application for the
                    Commissioner’s decision to be reversed is therefore granted. Costs are
