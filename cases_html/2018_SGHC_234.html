The second accused (“Alfian”) is a 48-year-old Singaporean. It is undisputed that on 24 May 2016, Lingkes delivered a bundle wrapped in black tape (“Bundle P3”) to Alfian at the void deck of Block 289 Yishun Avenue 6. Bundle P3 was subsequently found to contain not less than 1,373.7g of granular/powdery substance that was analysed and found to contain not less than 52.77g of diamorphine (“the Drugs”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>Lingkes and Alfian were tried jointly and they each claimed trial to one charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

Alfian admitted that he knew the contents of Bundle P3 but that he was simply a courier tasked to collect the Drugs and to pass them on to someone else. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charges against Lingkes and Alfian respectively, and I convicted them on their respective charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>Under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment is death. Pursuant to s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty if the requirements set out in s 33B(2) of the MDA are satisfied. I found that Lingkes’ role in the offence was restricted to that of a courier. However, the Prosecution did not issue Lingkes with a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, and as such I passed the mandatory death sentence on him. I also found that Alfian’s role in the offence was restricted to that of a courier. The Prosecution issued a certificate of substantive assistance in respect of Alfian, and I thus imposed the alternative sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 15 strokes of the cane on him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>Lingkes has appealed against the conviction and sentence.

The following account of the events leading up to and including the arrest of Lingkes and Alfian is undisputed and is based on statements given by CNB officers recording their observations during, and conduct of, the operation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>At about 8.30am, Alfian and one Rodrigues Morris Christopher (“Rodrigues”) arrived at bus stop number 2 along Senoko Drive. Alfian was wearing a white top and carrying a brown haversack. Alfian and Rodrigues were seen alternating between pacing about the bus stop and sitting on the bench at the bus stop. Around 10.30am, Alfian and Rodrigues then left the bus stop and walked along Senoko Drive in the direction of Senoko Avenue. They continued along Senoko Avenue towards Admiralty Road West, where they boarded a bus. At about 11.10am, Alfian and Rodrigues were seen walking along Yishun Avenue 7 near Block 288 and in the direction of Block 289. They sat down at a stone bench between Blocks 288 and 289 and, soon after, got up and sat down at another stone bench at the void deck of Block 289.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>At about 11.40am, Lingkes and one Suresh Sigamani (“Suresh”) were seen walking towards the void deck of Block 289 in the direction of Block 288. Lingkes approached Alfian, and when they met, Lingkes and Alfian were observed looking down into their respective haversacks. Shortly thereafter, Alfian and Rodrigues walked away from Lingkes. CNB officers subsequently arrested Alfian and Rodrigues at about 11.43 am around Block 284, and Lingkes and Suresh at about 11.48 am at the bus stop in front of Block 289. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>Alfian’s haversack was searched and a black “City Chain” paper bag containing a big rectangular shaped bundle wrapped in black tape (Bundle P3) was retrieved.

Exhibit D was a table showing communications between Suresh and Lingkes, and between either of them and a Malaysian number which Lingkes identified as belonging to “Ayyavoo”. According to Lingkes, Ayyavoo was a Malaysian man who had instructed him to enter Singapore to collect money and under whose instructions he had picked up and delivered Bundle P3 on 24 May 2016. It was not disputed that the phone numbers traced to Lingkes and Suresh in Exhibit D were the phone numbers tied to their mobile devices.

He was employed as a security officer at an illegal casino in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, earning a monthly salary of RM$1,500 (or about RM$2,000 with overtime). He had been employed at the casino since March 2016, and that was when he came to know Ayyavoo. Ayyavoo was in charge of security at the casino and was also an illegal moneylender. However, he did not know whether Ayyavoo was dealing in drugs.

Lingkes agreed as Ayyavoo had offered to pay him RM$500 for each trip into Singapore. Prior to his arrest, Lingkes had entered Singapore on two other occasions to collect money for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business. I will refer to these as the “First Occasion” and “Second Occasion”, and to the day of his arrest as the “Third Occasion”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>The First Occasion was sometime in April 2016.

Instead, M directed Lingkes to look at the floor of the car where there was one big bundle (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Bundle P3) and one small bundle (“the small bundle”). Both bundles were wrapped in black tape.

In cross-examination, Lingkes elaborated that M had asked him to do so as a favour, and that the two bundles were to be given to different recipients. He was to pass the small bundle to someone at the “Tiger company” at Tuas, and Bundle P3 to someone else at Yishun, where he was also to collect money.

When the car arrived, Lingkes approached the car with the small bundle and one of the passengers (whom I will refer to as “X”) “grabbed” the small bundle from Lingkes and “threw” a sealed envelope out of the car. The car then drove off. Lingkes picked up the envelope and tore it open to check if it contained money. Inside, he found “hell notes”.

</div> Lingkes was thus presumed to be in possession of the Drugs, and to know of the nature of the Drugs, unless the contrary is proved. To rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, Lingkes can show, on a balance of probabilities, that “he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug” (<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”) at [18]).

Lingkes’ defence was that he believed that Bundle P3 contained tobacco. However, I found that his assertion was not a credible one.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Veracity of Lingkes’ claim that he was collecting money for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>First, I disbelieved Lingkes’ account that he was merely collecting money for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business or that his role was limited to collecting money. The evidence strongly suggested that Lingkes was aware that he was assisting Ayyavoo in some illicit activities, that the delivery of items was within Lingkes’ job scope all along, and that he knew that the moneys received from Alfian on the Second and Third Occasions were for the items that he had passed to Alfian. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>The circumstances surrounding how Lingkes was to go about collecting money from Ayyavoo were highly suspicious. Lingkes was never informed of who and where he was to collect money from until after he had entered Singapore. Even after entering Singapore, he was content to act on Ayyavoo’s immediate directions that were issued to him one location and one counterparty at a time, without ever being provided with any means of contacting the counterparty. He was also never given the name of the persons he was meeting but only a description. Moreover, although Lingkes was tasked to collect money from M three times, he was never given M’s name or contact details, but had to laboriously rely on Ayyavoo to inform him of the meeting venue each time. Lingkes did not provide any reasons why Ayyavoo operated with such a level of secrecy and insecurity, especially if Lingkes was merely collecting debts as he claimed. I found it unbelievable that Lingkes did not find this mode of operation suspicious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>Furthermore, it was odd that Ayyavoo could not collect the money from borrowers in Singapore himself, particularly when he did not seem to be unavailable. In fact, and based on Lingkes’ own account, when he returned from Singapore on the First and Second Occasions, Ayyavoo was readily anticipating him at the Johor Bahru customs checkpoint where Lingkes would hand over the money. Further, Lingkes claimed that Ayyavoo had asked him to collect money from Singapore borrowers since Lingkes was in Singapore frequently to search for a job. But Lingkes’ account showed that for each of the First to Third Occasions, he had entered Singapore for the sole purpose of carrying out Ayyavoo’s instructions. There was no evidence that Lingkes was, on any of the three Occasions, looking for a job in Singapore, and was collecting money for Ayyavoo on the way only because it was convenient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>I found that it should have been clear to Lingkes that the deliveries on the Second and Third Occasions were carried out for Ayyavoo and that the money collected for the deliveries was unrelated to the moneylending business. The strange arrangements between Ayyavoo and M showed that Ayyavoo was the one directing the delivery of the items that M passed to Lingkes on the Second and Third Occasions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>First, although M gave Lingkes the items for delivery supposedly as a favour <span class="font-italic">to M</span>, it was <span class="font-italic">Ayyavoo</span> who gave Lingkes details of where and when to meet the intended recipients and how to identify them. Second, Lingkes asked <span class="font-italic">Ayyavoo </span>whether he could deliver items for M, and only did so when Ayyavoo instructed him to. Third, even though Ayyavoo was not in Singapore, he appeared to have knowledge of what items M was handing to Lingkes for delivery as he was able to give Lingkes independent confirmation of their contents over the phone. This would have suggested to Lingkes that Ayyavoo had prior arrangements with M for Lingkes to pick up these items. Further, when Lingkes received hell notes in return for the small bundle which he delivered as a favour <span class="font-italic">for M</span> (as he claimed), it was <span class="font-italic">Ayyavoo</span> who reassured Lingkes that this was alright. Lastly, by Lingkes’ own account, the money that he collected from the recipients of the items was to be handed over to <span class="font-italic">Ayyavoo</span>. This was despite the fact that it was M who had also asked Lingkes to collect money from the recipients. It would have been a most unlikely coincidence that each of the recipients of the items were also borrowers who separately owed money to Ayyavoo. Indeed, Lingkes admitted that when he agreed to assist M to deliver the bundles, he was in fact assisting Ayyavoo. Although M did not inform Lingkes <span class="font-italic">who</span><span class="font-italic">se</span> money he was to collect at Tiger company and at Yishun when he delivered the small bundle and Bundle P3, Lingkes had assumed that the money was meant for Ayyavoo, rather than M.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span>In these circumstances, it was implausible that Lingkes could have thought that the money he was collecting was unrelated to the delivery of the items and was purely for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business. Lingkes’ own conduct, in taking directions from Ayyavoo about the deliveries and handing over the money (which came from the recipients of the items) to Ayyavoo, was inconsistent with such a belief. Thus, I doubted Lingkes’ claim that the deliveries were done as a favour for M and that the money he was collecting was for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business rather than in exchange for the items delivered. Indeed, in Lingkes’ investigation statement dated 19 July 2016, he stated that he “did not know” if the money he received from Alfian on the Third Occasion was in consideration of Bundle P3 or for Ayyavoo’s moneylending business; this was inconsistent with his defence in court that he was collecting debts for Ayyavoo on all three occasions. Further, the fact that Lingkes did not inquire why he was taking instructions from Ayyavoo for a delivery entrusted to him by M suggested to me that Ayyavoo had tasked Lingkes from the outset to not only collect money but also pick up items from M for delivery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>Finally, Lingkes was receiving a substantial payment of RM500 for a simple job of (what he claimed to be) debt collection. Lingkes acknowledged that this was “good money” to make as it was a third to a quarter of his monthly salary. This ought to have alerted Lingkes that he was involved in something riskier than merely collecting debts or delivering documents and tobacco. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>For these reasons, I found that Lingkes was aware that he was assisting Ayyavoo in illicit activities beyond the purported moneylending business.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Veracity of Lingkes’ claim that he believed Bundle P3 contained tobacco</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>Second, on 24 May 2016, Lingkes received and delivered Bundle P3 in very suspicious circumstances that ought to have alerted him to the illegal nature of its contents and prompted him to inquire further. The following facts would have caused a reasonable person to suspect and verify the contents of Bundle P3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>At [45]–[46] and [50] above, I explained why Lingkes’ disproportionate remuneration and the secrecy surrounding the meeting times and places and the identity of the counterparties would have raised suspicions that Lingkes was involved in an illicit endeavour. Those facts and circumstances were also incongruent with Lingkes’ purported debt collection job. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>On 24 May 2016, there was an abrupt and substantial change in Lingkes’ job scope, but by his own account, he never protested. He testified that prior to entering Singapore, he had only been instructed to help Ayyavoo to collect money but was not told how many persons to collect from and how much to collect from each person. Furthermore, instead of collecting money from M, Lingkes was tasked to deliver two bundles which he picked up from M. If his purpose for meeting M was to collect money, then the meeting was entirely futile because M enlisted Lingkes’ help to run some errands instead. Lingkes claimed that he had agreed to deliver the two bundles, when he had entered Singapore to collect money, because he saw it as a favour for M and as Ayyavoo had asked him to do. For reasons explained at [47]–[48] above, I did not believe Lingkes’ claim that the deliveries were carried out as a favour for M.

I found it particularly bewildering that M needed Lingkes to deliver the small bundle to X. If the 3M and Tiger company were in close proximity as Lingkes said they were, M could have delivered the small bundle himself, especially when he had a car and a chauffeur at his disposal. It made no sense that M, who was in Singapore, needed Lingkes, who had to travel all the way from Malaysia, to carry out these deliveries to and collect money from persons in Singapore. I found it difficult to believe that Lingkes did not find this request strange if he was unaware that he was delivering illegal substances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>Despite these suspicious circumstances, Lingkes testified that it did not occur to him to check what was inside the two bundles he received from M.

He then called Ayyavoo and Ayyavoo also told him that the bundles contained “tembakau” and instructed Lingkes to deliver them and collect money from the recipients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>In my view, Lingkes had no good explanation for reposing so much trust in M and Ayyavoo and in light of the suspicious circumstances.

He did not know Ayyavoo’s full name, or if “Ayyavoo” was even his actual name.

</div> Lingkes conceded that he did not know much about Ayyavoo beyond his role as the head of security at the casino. Lingkes claimed that he trusted Ayyavoo because Ayyavoo had done a lot for him by finding him a place to stay. However, this did not seem to justify such deep trust to the extent that Lingkes would shut his eyes to all the dubious facts surrounding the delivery of Bundle P3. Indeed, Lingkes’ relationship with Ayyavoo was a transactional one, as he agreed to perform these jobs to earn “good money”. Moreover, there was no evidence that Ayyavoo had seen the contents of Bundle P3 such that he could provide Lingkes with credible assurance that it contained tobacco. This is especially when Lingkes claimed that M had <span class="font-italic">unexpectedly</span> informed him to deliver Bundle P3 only when he met M. Lastly, I found that Lingkes was fully aware that Ayyavoo was a shady character who was involved in a number of illegal activities, including drug trafficking. This finding is supported by the Audio Messages, which I deal with below. I also note that Lingkes had saved Ayyavoo’s number under the contact name “G” rather than his name,

Yet Lingkes made no real attempt to independently verify the contents of Bundle P3 prior to delivering it, even though he had ample opportunity to do so after he discovered the hell notes and his suspicion was aroused.

I found him to be evasive particularly because the conversation was not a mundane conversation but pertained to drug activities, as Lingkes himself acknowledged during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>At this juncture, I deal with Defence counsel’s submission that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call Suresh to support its case that the Audio Messages captured a conversation which Suresh had with Lingkes. I rejected this submission. This was not a case in which the Prosecution was withholding any material information which was solely within its knowledge and possession to produce. Lingkes could have easily called Suresh to support his case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Suresh did not have this conversation with Lingkes) but chose not to. It also bears remembering that, with the presumptions under s 18(1) and s 18(2) of the MDA engaged, Lingkes bore the burden of proving, on balance, that he was not in possession of the Drugs nor had the requisite knowledge of the nature of the Drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>Hence, having found that Lingkes was the party exchanging the Audio Messages with Suresh, I was satisfied that the Audio Messages showed that Lingkes had knowledge of drugs and was involved in drug-related activities. At trial, Lingkes admitted that he understood the Audio Messages to be a conversation about procuring drugs.

</div> He understood that the words “papan”, “set”, “rate” and “ice” pertained to the selling rate of drugs. In the light of this, it appeared to me that Lingkes had falsely attempted to deny any association with the Audio Messages because he understood that the contents of these messages would be tainting. Lingkes’ credibility was thereby diminished. I add that I had the benefit of hearing the Audio Messages in court and was satisfied that the voice in the Audio Messages was similar to Lingkes’ voice in court. Being cognisant that the court is not here to give an expert opinion on voice-recognition, I make this observation merely for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Second, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that “Aivoo” and “Ayyavoo” were the same person and that Lingkes had deliberately sought to dissociate them because it would have been damaging to his defence as it would reveal that he was assisting someone who, he was aware, trafficked drugs. Coincidentally, Lingkes claimed that he knew both Aivoo and Ayyavoo at the same time while working at the casino; and one (Aivoo) was a security officer while the other (Ayyavoo) was the head of security. Lingkes knew nothing about Aivoo’s background or where he lived.

</div> Next Lingkes has not produced a shred of evidence to prove Aivoo’s existence as a distinct person from Ayyavoo, apart from Aivoo’s name being mentioned in the Audio Messages. Even though the Audio Messages refer to some contact with Aivoo regarding drugs, Lingkes claimed that he had never contacted Aivoo on the phone. He did not even have Aivoo’s phone number saved in any of his phones.

Lingkes had “turned a blind eye” to circumstances which would have prompted a reasonable person to suspect and verify whether Bundle P3 contained the Drugs (<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai </span>at [21]) and he did not verify the contents of Bundle P3 though he could easily have done so. Further, Lingkes had committed an act of trafficking in the Drugs by giving or delivering Bundle P3 which contained the Drugs to Alfian.
