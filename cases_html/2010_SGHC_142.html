<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The provision of insurance to cover workmen for
                    claims against injuries and death in the course of their employment is a common
                    feature of the construction industry. In fact, it is statutorily embodied in
                    s 23(1) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Cap 354,
                    1998 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) (now s 23(1) of the Work Injury
                    Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed)). The principal purpose of the
                    insurance is to ensure that <em>employers</em> provide
                    adequate cover for claims by workmen under the Act. Main contractors and
                    sub-contractors, as employers, typically arrange insurance policies that they
                    believe comprehensively cover all eventualities arising from injuries by such
                    workmen. It is also not uncommon for the main contractor to arrange insurance
                    policies to cover the workmen employed by its sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The question which arises in this dispute is
                    whether the insurance policy which was arranged by the main contractor
                    ostensibly to cover all workmen involved in the project, including those
                    employed by its sub-contractors, covered <em>claims for indemnity
                        by the main contractor</em> against its insurer in respect of its
                    liability at common law, rather than under the Act, to workmen who were
                        <em>employed by its sub-contractor</em>. The present
                    dispute examines the adequacy or lack thereof of insurance policies that are
                    arranged by main contractors in the belief that they are sufficiently
                    comprehensive to cover all situations arising from injuries to workmen in the
                    course of employment of the construction project. It is hoped that this decision
                    would shed some light on the scope and coverage of such policies so that
                    contractors and their insurance brokers can review them to determine whether
                    they in fact cover the intended liabilities and if not, whether steps should be
                    taken to address the gaps in future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a Bangladeshi national who was
                    injured on 5 November 2007 while working at a factory construction site at
                    Tuas South Avenue 3 (“the worksite”). At the material time, he was
                    employed by Utracon Structural System Pte Ltd (“Utracon”) which
                    was the sub-contractor engaged by the defendant (itself the main contractor
                    engaged by M/s Kim Teck Leong (Pte) Ltd, the developer/owner of the
                    worksite) for the post-tensioning works for the concrete flooring at the
                    worksite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       While the plaintiff was working on the
                    scaffolding at the worksite, the work platform gave way and caused him to fall
                    through the scaffolding from a height of about nine metres. The plaintiff
                    sustained serious injuries as a result of the fall and commenced the present
                    action against the defendant for breach of statutory duties and for
                    occupier’s liability. The defendant then brought the Third Party
                    proceedings against Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore Ltd (“the
                    Insurer”) for an indemnity under the Workmen’s Compensation Policy
                    No DWCP07S001548 (“the WC Policy”) and/or the
                    Contractors’ All Risks Policy No DGCR07S004322 (“the CAR
                    Policy”) for the damages payable to the plaintiff. The Insurer denied
                    that the indemnity claim is payable under either of the insurance
                    policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On the first day of the trial, the plaintiff
                    settled his claim against the defendant and interlocutory judgment was entered
                    at 95% liability in favour of the plaintiff. Thereafter the trial continued only
                    as to the defendant’s indemnity claim against the Insurer. At the close of
                    the defendant’s case, the defendant clarified that it was not proceeding
                    under the CAR Policy. The defendant’s claim therefore rests solely under
                    the WC Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The dispute between the parties is essentially a
                    question of construction of the terms of the WC Policy, the most material of
                    which is the Operative Clause, which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOW THIS POLICY WITNESSETH that if any workman in the Insured’s
                        employment shall sustain personal injury by accident or disease caused
                        during the Period of Insurance and arising out of and in the course of his
                        employment by the Insured in the Business, the Company will subject to the
                        terms exceptions conditions and warranties, and any memorandum if
                        applicable, contained herein or endorsed hereon (all of which are
                        hereinafter collectively referred to as the Terms of this Policy) indemnify
                        the Insured against all sums for which the Insured shall be liable to pay
                        compensation either under the Legislation or at Common Law, and will in
                        addition pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Insured with the written
                        consent of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant accepts that to succeed, the claim
                    must come within the Operative Clause, for it is common ground that the burden
                    of proof is on it to prove its claim under the WC Policy: <em>Hurst v Evans</em> [1917] 1 KB 352.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The parties, however, are at odds as to the true
                    construction of the Operative Clause, and it will be helpful to set out their
                    respective submissions, as well as the issues that arise for my
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant submits that, on the true
                    construction of the Operative Clause, the WC Policy deems the plaintiff to be a
                    “workman in [the defendant’s] employment” who sustained
                    personal injury by an accident “arising out of and in the course of his
                    employment by [the defendant]”, notwithstanding that, at the material
                    time, the plaintiff was not employed by the defendant but by its sub-contractor,
                    Utracon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant has raised several interesting
                    and creative arguments in reliance on other terms of the WC Policy in aid of its
                    claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the defendant argues that the
                        Interpretation Clause in the WC Policy, as well as the definition of the
                        term “employer” in the Act, support its reading of the
                        Operative Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the defendant relies on the “Name of the
                        Insured” Clause under the WC Policy, which refers to the defendant
                        and all its sub-contractors of all tiers and levels as
                        “contractor”. It is common ground that Utracon as one of the
                        sub-contractors was covered as an “Insured” under the WC
                        Policy. The defendant submits that since the defendant and all its
                        sub-contractors (including Utracon) are collectively referred to in the
                        “Name of Insured” Clause as “contractor” in the
                        singular, it follows, as a matter of definition, that the plaintiff should
                        be treated as an employee of the defendant for the purposes of the WC Policy
                        even though he was in fact employed by Utracon. In other words, both the
                        defendant and Utracon, being defined as the singular
                        “contractor”, are deemed by the WC Policy to be the <em>same</em> “Insured”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the defendant also relies on
                        the insertion of a “Risk No 001” Clause in the WC
                        Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth,
                        the defendant seeks to attach significance to the deletion of 2 Exceptions
                        in the WC Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     Finally, the defendant submits that, since the WC Policy is
                        ambiguous, it should be interpreted in its favour by applying a <em>contra proferentem</em>
                construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Insurer submits that, on the true
                    construction of the WC Policy, the defendant’s claim for indemnity does
                    not fall within the Operative Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Insurer accepts that the employees of
                    Utracon were covered under the WC Policy. However, it submits that the WC Policy
                    only responds to claims brought by one of the Insured in respect of liability,
                    at common law or under the Act, incurred by <em>that</em>
                    Insured to any workman employed by <em>that</em> Insured.
                    Accordingly, given that the plaintiff was, at the material time, employed by
                    Utracon, the WC Policy would only be engaged if the plaintiff had successfully
                    sued Utracon, and the claim for indemnity against the Insurer was now being
                    brought by Utracon. Since, however, the claim is being brought by the defendant,
                    who was <em>not</em> the employer of the plaintiff, the
                    indemnity claim is not payable. Put simply, the WC Policy covers indemnity
                    claims brought by the relevant Insured provided the liability of the relevant
                    Insured arose as a result of a claim by a workman against the relevant Insured
                        <em>qua employer</em>. The WC Policy does not cover the
                    relevant Insured, in this case the defendant, against its liability to the
                    plaintiff <em>qua occupier</em> of the worksite. In other
                    words, the Insurer submits that, contrary to the defendant’s submissions,
                    the defendant and Utracon are <em>not</em> deemed by the WC
                    Policy to be the same “Insured”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Insurer further submits that the clear
                    position as set out in the Operative Clause is not altered by the “Name
                    of the Insured” Clause or by the insertion of the “Risk No
                    001” Clause or by the deletion of the Exceptions. The insertion and the
                    deletions were to address different purposes and do not change the scope or
                    ambit of the Operative Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A number of issues therefore arise for my
                    determination, namely:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The effect of the definition of
                            “Employer” in the Act on the construction of the WC
                            Policy;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The effect of the “Name of Insured”
                            Clause;</div>

                                proferentem</em> construction of the WC Policy.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before I go on to examine these issues,
                    however, I would like to say a bit more about the Operative
                Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Operative Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As stated, the defendant must bring its
                    indemnity claim within the Operative Clause in order to succeed in this action,
                    but the main obstacle that stands in the way of the defendant is the undeniable
                    fact that the plaintiff was not in its employment at the time of the accident.
                    Instead, he was employed by Utracon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The inherent difficulty facing the defendant
                    is self-evident when a plain reading of the Operative Clause is adopted, for it
                    reveals that the term “Insured” must be understood as referring to
                    different entities in order for the defendant’s claim to be
                    maintained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOW THIS POLICY WITNESSETH that if any workman [<em>the

                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is obvious that the description of the
                    “Insured” cannot mean different things in different parts of the
                    same Operative Clause. The description must have one consistent meaning
                    throughout the clause. Therefore if Utracon is the employer and a claim for
                    damages is brought by the workman against Utracon, an indemnity claim by Utracon
                    against the Insurer would fall squarely within the clause. Similarly if a claim
                    for damages is brought against the defendant, the claim is covered provided the
                    defendant was the employer of the workman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In this connection, it is perhaps apposite to
                    refer to the defendant’s closing submission where the defendant sought to
                    explain the scope and purpose of the WC Policy. The defendant submits that
                    “it is common practice for main contractor [<em>sic</em>] in a building project to arrange for all the necessary
                    insurance policies. The policies would insure not only the interest of the main
                    contractor but also the interest of all their sub-contractors.” Indeed
                    such was the case in the present dispute. The WC Policy that was arranged by the
                    defendant did insure the interest of sub-contractors as well. There is no
                    dispute that Utracon is covered by the WC Policy. However that is not the issue
                    in the present action. The issue instead is whether the defendant is covered for
                    indemnity claims against the Insurer in respect of its common law liabilities as
                    occupier to workmen who were not in its employment but were employed by its
                    sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is not in dispute that the plaintiff was
                    not, at the material time, in the employment of the defendant. Neither is it
                    disputed that the plaintiff cannot be said to be an employee by reason of any
                    exercise of control by the defendant over him. Therefore, on a plain and
                    ordinary reading of the WC Policy, the defendant would not be entitled to an
                    indemnity from the Insurer in respect of the plaintiff’s successful claim
                    against the defendant on the basis of occupier’s liability: <em>Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction &amp; Engineering Co
                        Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 746 (“<em>Awang bin Dollah</em>”) at [59].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Awang bin
                        Dollah</em>, the Court of Appeal was confronted with a similar issue,
                    though in that case, the sub-sub-contractor, Quick Start Construction, unlike
                    the present case, was not an insured under the policy. The Court of Appeal held,
                    however, that even if the policy had covered Quick Start Construction, the
                    indemnity claim against the insurer would still not be payable because the
                    plaintiff’s case succeeded against the main contractor, the defendant, on
                    the basis of <em>occupier’s</em> liability, and not
                    on the basis of <em>employer’s</em> liability. The
                    plaintiff did not succeed against the defendant on the basis of employer’s
                    liability because the Court of Appeal had held that the plaintiff was not, at
                    common law, employed by the defendant, nor was he held to be an employee of the
                    defendant by reason of any right of control exercised by the defendant over him.
                    It is pertinent to note that the operative clause of the policy in <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> was in all material aspects identical
                    to the Operative Clause at issue here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     
          <em>Prima facie</em>,
                    therefore, <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> indicates that the
                    terms “employment” and “course of employment” are to
                    be understood as legal terms of art, bearing the specialised meanings they are
                    understood to convey for the purposes of employer’s and vicarious
                    liability in tort law rather than some other meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant must therefore overcome the
                    plain wording of the Operative Clause by demonstrating that the WC Policy, on
                    its true construction, provides that the plaintiff was treated as or deemed to
                    be in the defendant’s employment. In particular, the defendant must show
                    that, on the true construction of the WC Policy, the term
                    “Insured” in the Operative Clause should <em>not</em> be understood as referring to different entities, but should
                    be consistently construed as referring to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Definition of “Employer” under the Workmen’s
                Compensation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant sought to demonstrate this,
                    first, by relying on the Interpretation Clause in the WC Policy which provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    ALL references to “Legislation” in
                            this Policy shall mean the Workmen’s Compensation Act

                            made thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Words used in the Policy shall have the same
                            meaning as that defined in Legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant submits that, as the term
                    “employer” is defined in ss 2, 12(3) and 17 of the Act, these
                    definitions should be adopted, and, as a result, the defendant can be considered
                    the “employer” of the plaintiff and should therefore be
                    indemnified by the Insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In particular, the defendant relies on
                    s 17 read with s 12(3) of the Act to achieve this result, the material
                    portions of which are set out below:</p>

                        to any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation which
                        he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately

                        except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to
                        the wages of the workman under the employer by whom he is immediately
                        employed.</p>

                        independently of this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)     Nothing in this section shall be
                        construed as preventing a workman from recovering compensation under this
                        Act from the contractor instead of the principal, and a claim made against a
                        principal or a contractor, as the case may be, shall not bar subsequent
                        proceedings under this Act against the other to recover so much of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)     This section shall not apply in any case

                        management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant submits that, in the
                    circumstances of this case, it should be regarded as the
                    “principal” for the purposes of s 17, and that, since
                    s 12(3) deems a principal to be an “employer”, and since the
                    WC Policy adopts the same definition of words used in the Act, the plaintiff was
                    in the defendant’s “employment” when he sustained
                    “personal injury… arising out of and in the course of his
                    employment” by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     By contending that the WC Policy thereby deems
                    the plaintiff to be in its employment, the defendant is able to preserve a
                    sensible meaning to the term “Insured” in the Operative Clause,
                    since, if the defendant’s contention is accepted, it will consistently
                    refer to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, the defendant’s submission that
                    the WC Policy “deems” the plaintiff to be in the defendant’s
                    employment by virtue of the Interpretation Clause and the various provisions of
                    the Act is fraught with difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As correctly highlighted by counsel for the
                    Insurer, the relevant term in the Operative Clause is
                    “employment”, not “employer”.
                    “Employment” is not defined in the Act but is a concept (together
                    with “course of employment”) well understood at common law. It is
                    difficult to imagine why the parties would wish to define
                    “employment” and “course of employment” collaterally
                    by reference to the definition of <em>employer</em> in the
                    Act when <em>employment</em> itself is already well defined
                    at common law. If the parties had wanted to introduce a different meaning of
                    “employment” or “course of employment”, they could
                    have done so expressly. Notwithstanding the Interpretation Clause of the WC
                    Policy, it is therefore not appropriate to look to the Act for definitions of
                    terms in the WC Policy which the Act itself does not define.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This is confirmed by <em>Vandyke v Fender and another</em> [1970] 2 QB 292
                        (“<em>Vandyke v Fender</em>”). In
                        <em>Vandyke v Fender</em>, the plaintiff was injured on
                    his way to work as a result of the negligence of the defendant, his co-worker,
                    who was driving the car both were travelling in. The plaintiff’s
                    employers, being vicariously liable to the plaintiff, sought to be indemnified
                    by their insurers under a policy which provided the employers with an indemnity
                    against liability for damages and costs</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">if any person under a contract of service… with the insured shall
                        sustain bodily injury… arising out of and in the course of such
                        person’s employment by the insured in the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In determining whether the plaintiff had been
                    injured in the course of his employment, the trial judge had held that the
                    phrase “arising out of and in the course of his employment” should
                    be interpreted in the light of the UK National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)
                    Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo 6, c 62) (“the Industrial Injuries Act”),
                    s 9(1) of which had imparted a specific meaning to the phrase “out
                    of and in the course of his employment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The English Court of Appeal disagreed, holding
                    (at 305) that s 9(1) had only altered the interpretation of the phrase
                    “out of and in the course of his employment” for the special
                    purpose of the Industrial Injuries Act and not for any other purpose.
                    Essentially, the English Court of Appeal held that the phrase “arising
                    out of and in the course of his employment” in employer’s liability
                    policies was to be interpreted as it had long been interpreted at common law,
                    rather than by adopting a specific statutory definition when that statute did
                    not purport to change the established common law position. This reasoning
                    applies <em>a fortiori</em> to the present case, for the
                    defendant seeks to rely on the statutory definition of a <em>different</em> word, <em>ie
                        “employer”</em>, in order to interpret the phrase
                    “arising out of and in the course of his <em>employment</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Further, s 12(3) of the Act makes clear
                    that the definition of “employer” it sets forth is specifically
                    “for the purposes of this section”. In my view, it is not
                    permissible to extend the definition of “employer” in s 12(3)
                    of the Act, expressed to be applicable only to s 12, to colour the meaning
                    of “employment” which is a different term in a different context
                    under the Operative Clause when the term “employment” can be
                    objectively determined by reference to the common law: <em>Awang
                        bin Dollah</em> and <em>Vandyke v
                    Fender</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In any event, s 2 of the Act provides a
                    definition of “employer” as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>2</b>.—(1) In this Act, <em>unless the context otherwise requires</em>—</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    in relation to a person employed for the
                                purpose of any game or recreation and engaged or paid through a
                                club, the manager or members of the managing committee of that
                                club,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and where the services of an employee are temporarily lent or let on hire
                        to another person by the person with whom the employee has entered into a
                        contract of service or apprenticeship, the latter shall, for the purposes of
                        this Act, be deemed to continue to be the employer of the employee whilst he
                        is working for that other person;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     From s 2, it is clear that the employer
                    is the person with whom the workman has entered into a contract of service.
                    Furthermore, the definition of “employer” applies unless the
                        <em>context otherwise requires</em>. The reference in
                    s 12(3) of the Act that the “employer” shall include any
                    person referred to in s 17 of the Act as the principal is an example of
                    interpreting the description of “employer” in a different context.
                    Therefore, the default position (unless the context otherwise requires) under
                    the Act is that the employer is the person with whom the workman has a contract
                    of service which, in the present case, is Utracon and not the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Definition of “Insured” in the WC Policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In buttressing its submission that the term
                    “Insured” should be consistently interpreted to refer to the
                    defendant, emphasis is placed on the fact that the “Name of
                    Insured” Clause in the WC Policy states:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defendant submits that, since the parties
                    have referred to the defendant and the sub-contractor(s) as
                    “contractor” in the singular (as opposed to the reference to
                    “principals” in the plural), the “Insured” in the
                    Operative Clause must therefore refer to the “contractor”,
                        <em>ie both</em> the defendant and Utracon. Since the
                    plaintiff was in the employment of Utracon, the defendant submits that he was
                    therefore also, by virtue of the “Name of Insured” Clause, in the
                    employment of the defendant, at least for the purposes of the WC
                Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There are a number of reasons, however, why
                    the defendant’s contention cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     First, this is an extremely strained
                    interpretation. The defendant is in essence arguing that the plaintiff should be
                    deemed to be in its employment, not because of any express clause to that
                    effect, but because the “Name of Insured” Clause implies that the
                    defendant and Utracon are to be treated as one entity, <em>viz</em> the “contractor”, which further implies that a
                    workman in the employment of one can be treated as in the employment of the
                    other (at least for the purposes of the WC Policy).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second, if the defendant’s
                    interpretation is correct, it would follow that any workman in the
                    defendant’s employment can also be treated as being in the employment of
                    Utracon for the purposes of the WC Policy. If, therefore, one of the
                    defendant’s workmen (“workman A”) was injured as a result of
                    a tortious act of one of Utracon’s workmen (“workman B”),
                    and Utracon was found vicariously liable to workman A for workman B’s
                    tort, Utracon would, on the construction of the WC Policy urged by the
                    defendant, be able to claim an indemnity from the Insurer, on the basis that
                    workman A is “any workman in the Insured’s employment” who
                    sustained a personal injury by an accident “arising out of and in the
                    course of his employment by the Insured”. This result is so manifestly
                    contrary to established principles of tort law that it is inconceivable that it
                    can be achieved via an inadequately-drafted definition clause. In the absence of
                    plain wording to such effect, I find it impossible to say that this is what the
                    parties had contemplated all along, which reinforces the inference that the
                    construction advocated by the defendant is not correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Third, the interpretation argued for by the
                    defendant requires the defendant and Utracon to be treated as one joint entity,
                        <em>viz</em> the “contractor”. This
                    implies that the WC Policy is, on the defendant’s interpretation, a joint
                    policy rather than a composite policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The difference is explained by <em>MacGillivray on Insurance Law</em> (Nicholas Leigh-Jones Gen
                    Ed) (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>MacGillivray</em>”) at
                    paras 1-202 and 1-203:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Joint and composite insurance</em>. It has become
                        commonplace for reasons of commercial convenience to insure the interests of
                        a number of assured persons under one policy of insurance… The fact
                        that a number of assureds are insured by one policy does not by itself make
                        the policy a joint insurance. <em>There cannot be a joint
                            insurance policy unless the interests of the several persons who are
                            interested in the subject-matter are joint interests, so that they are
                            exposed to the same risks and will suffer a joint loss by the occurrence
                            of an insured peril</em>. So if two persons are joint owners of
                        property, an insurance to indemnify both against damage to it will afford an
                        indemnity against their common loss which they will both necessarily have
                        suffered. The interests of such co-assureds are so inseparably connected
                        that a loss or benefit must necessarily affect them both…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the interests of different persons in the same insured
                        subject-matter are diverse interests, a policy expressed to insure all
                        interested persons must be construed as a composite policy which is intended
                        to insure each co-assured separately in respect of his own interests.
                            <em>Not only does the policy wording show that it is
                            intended to cover the different co-assureds separately for their
                            respective interests, but perforce the elements of joint risk, joint
                            interest and joint loss will be absent. It is usual to describe the
                            co-assureds in a composite policy as being insured “for their
                            respective rights and interests”</em>, but a policy lacking
                        that wording may nonetheless be construed as composite…</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     A similar discussion is found in Merkin,
                        <em>Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance</em> (London:
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) (“<em>Colinvaux</em>”) at para 14-03:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Joint and composite policies</em>. Where two or
                        more persons are insured under a single policy, it is important to determine
                        whether the policy is joint or composite, in that the former is regarded as
                        a single contract whereas the latter is a bundle of contracts. The
                        distinction is based on the nature of the interests of the assureds.
                            <em>If the assureds share a common interest in the
                            insured subject-matter</em>, e.g. where they are joint owners of
                        property or partners, <em>the policy is joint. By contrast,
                            if the parties have different interests</em>, as in the case of a
                        landlord and tenant or a mortgagor and mortgagee, <em>the
                            policy is composite</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the parties have separate interests in the insured subject-matter, it
                        is established that <em>the usual wording of co-insurance,
                            which talks of the parties being insured “for their respective
                            rights and interests”, will result in a policy covering different
                            interests being treated as composite only</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The following co-insurances have been held to be
                            composite by their nature</em>: mortgagor and mortgagee, owner of
                        goods and hirer under a hire-purchase agreement, landlord and tenant,
                            <em>contractor and sub-contractor under a construction

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There is a clear reference in the “Name
                    of Insured” clause that the WC Policy is “for their respective
                    rights &amp; interests”, which appears to militate strongly in favour of
                    a composite policy. This is clear from the decision of Sir Wilfrid Greene
                    MR in <em>General Accident Fire and Life Assurance
                        Corporation Limited v Midland Bank Limited</em> [1940]
                    2 KB 388 (“<em>Midland Bank</em>”).
                    In <em>Midland Bank</em>, certain premises rented by Plant
                    Bros Ltd (“the company”) were insured against loss or damage by
                    fire. The insurance policy was expressed to be in favour of the company, its
                    secured creditor and the company’s landlord, “for their respective
                    rights and interests”, and one issue was whether the insurance policy
                    was, on its true construction, a joint policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In holding that the policy was, on its true
                    construction, a composite one, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR stated at 407-408
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the reference to the insured in the endorsement… contains
                        the words “for their respective rights and interests.” How is
                        that description of the insured and that description of the indemnity to
                        which they are to be entitled to be fitted into the printed form which uses
                        the phrase “the insured”? <em>It seems to me
                            that, wherever the phrase “the insured” appeared in the
                            printed part of this document, it would be wrong to treat that as
                            meaning, as a matter of construction, all the three persons named in the
                            endorsement</em>. <em>The printed words “the
                            insured” must be construed and qualified by the words “for
                            their respective rights and interests,”</em> and those
                        printed words must be given a construction which will fit in with the
                        essential nature of the contract which is being undertaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This is not, however, a complete answer to the
                    defendant’s submission, as the phrase “for their respective rights
                    &amp; interests” may refer only to, and the WC Policy may only be
                    composite as between, the “principals” (<em>ie</em> M/s Kim Teck Leong (Pte) Ltd and/or the Land Transport
                    Authority) on the one hand and the “contractor” (<em>ie</em> Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd and/or their
                    sub-contractors of all tiers and level) on the other. In other words, it is
                    possible that the WC Policy may still be a joint policy as between the defendant
                    and Utracon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This possible construction was raised by the
                    court during closing submissions. However after due consideration, I have come
                    to the conclusion that this possibility should be rejected for two
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     First, it appears that in joint policies, all
                    insureds must join in any action against the insurer: <em>Lombard
                        Australia Ltd v NRMA Insurance Ltd</em> [1969] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 575 (“<em>Lombard Australia</em>”). In
                        <em>Lombard Australia</em>, the Court of Appeal of the
                    Supreme Court of New South Wales held that an insurance policy taken out in the
                    names of a hire-purchase company and its customer was a composite policy, and
                    therefore the policy could be enforced by the plaintiff hire-purchase company
                    against the defendant insurer, without the plaintiff having to join its
                    customer’s executors (the customer being deceased). Derrington and Ashton,
                        <em>The Law of Liability Insurance</em> (LexisNexis:
                    Australia, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2005) at para 2-404 similarly
                    states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If the cover provided is joint, then all insured must
                            join in any action against the insurer</em>, in which case it may
                        raise any defence that it has against any of them... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the present case, the defendant has not
                    sought to join Utracon in its indemnity action against the
                Insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Second, and more importantly, in principle, it
                    is impossible to construe the WC Policy as a joint insurance, even as between
                    the defendant and Utracon. The defendant and Utracon have not jointly suffered
                    any loss; they have different interests in the subject matter of the insurance;
                    there is no joint risk and there is no joint element at all: <em>Midland Bank</em>, at 405 (<em>per</em> Sir
                    Wilfrid Greene MR).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The defendant has submitted that the
                    distinction between joint and composite policies is limited to insurance on
                    property, and has no application to liability insurance. It is true that
                        <em>Midland Bank</em> and <em>Lombard
                        Australia</em> were cases in which the subject-matter of the insurance
                    policy was property, but there is no reason in principle why the distinction
                    between joint and composite insurance cannot apply to liability insurance: one
                    insures against <em>loss</em> (see the definition of
                    insurance given by Sir Peter Webster in <em>Callaghan v Dominion
                        Insurance Co</em> [1997] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 541 at 544),
                    and both damage to property as well as liability in damages to a claimant are
                    equally losses which one may insure against.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     My view is reinforced by <em>The Law of Liability Insurance</em>, paras 2-396 to 2-407, where
                    there is an extensive and erudite discussion of joint and composite policies as
                    applied to liability insurance, containing numerous references to <em>Midland Bank and Lombard Australia</em>. I quote, for
                    instance, para 2-396, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The cover provided by a policy will be joint if the interests of the
                        insured are joint, and several if the interests are several. <em>Where two or more parties are insured under a single policy and
                            they have other than joint responsibility or duty of care</em>,
                        then, even though they might be jointly as well as severally liable to a
                        claimant, the right of the insurer to repudiate the policy as against one of
                        them for a breach of a condition does not thereby extend to a similar right
                        against the others. <em>Such a policy should be treated as
                            being several; and when a policy covers persons of different interests
                            as a contract that is composite for convenience, it does not cover the
                            parties jointly</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Therefore, the WC Policy is not, on its true
                    construction, a joint policy but a composite one, and the defendant’s
                    interpretation of the “Name of Insured” clause, <em>viz</em> that the defendant and Utracon are one notional
                    “contractor”, is not permissible. Hence, the term
                    “contractor” in the “Name of Insured” clause cannot
                    be “imported” into the Operative Clause, to assist the
                    defendant’s construction of the term “Insured” in the
                    Operative Clause to mean that the plaintiff was deemed or to be treated as its
                    employee.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(collectively “the description of employees”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is to be noted that under s 2 of the
                    Act, “workman” is defined as any person who has entered into a
                    contract of service with an employer whether by way of manual labour or
                    otherwise and whether the remuneration is calculated by time or by work done
                    subject to various exceptions set out therein which do not apply to the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant submits that the “Risk No
                    001” Clause reinforces its interpretation of the WC Policy, insofar as it
                    states that the “insured employees” are “all employees of
                    insured and all tiers subcontractors”, which is much wider than the
                    phrase “any workman in the Insured’s employment” used in the
                    Operative Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Consequently, the defendant submits that the
                    “Risk No 001” Clause demonstrates that workmen in the employment
                    of Utracon in general, and the plaintiff in particular, should be deemed, under
                    the WC Policy, to be workmen in the defendant’s employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Such a construction is however at odds with
                    the defendant’s own evidence. Mr Lye Meng Swee
                    (“Mr Lye”), formerly the Senior Manager of HSBC Insurance
                    Brokers (Singapore) Pte Ltd, testified on behalf of the defendant. He was the
                    insurance broker who arranged the WC Policy on behalf of the defendant. He
                    agreed under cross-examination that the “Risk No 001” Clause was
                    inserted to enlarge the scope of the WC Policy, so as to ensure that it would
                    not be limited to covering claims by workmen, but would also cover claims by any
                    employee, including a person other than a workman as defined under the Act, of
                    an Insured:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… And if you look at page 38 of your

                            EMPLOYEES” rather than “workmen”? Do you see

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the “Risk No 001” Clause was inserted to
                    expand the definition of a “workman”; it did not otherwise change
                    the scope of the Operative Clause – in particular, by modifying the
                    concept of “employment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Deletion of Exceptions (b) and (c)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant submits that the deletion of
                    paras (b) and (c) in the “Exceptions” Clause makes it clear that
                    the plaintiff is deemed to be in the defendant’s employment by and for the
                    purposes of the WC Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Exceptions (b) and (c) state, respectively,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Company shall not be liable in respect of</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The Insured’s liability to employees of
                            independent contractors engaged by the Insured.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    any employee of the Insured who is not a
                            “workman” within the meaning of the
                        Legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Exception (b) if undeleted would exclude a
                    claim by an Insured against the Insurer for indemnity against liability incurred
                    by it to an employee of independent contractors engaged by the Insured. Since
                    Exception (b) was deleted, the defendant submits that the intention must have
                    been to cover claims against an Insured by employees of independent contractors,
                    such as the plaintiff’s claim for occupier’s liability against the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     However the evidence adduced by the defendant
                    revealed the purpose behind the deletion of Exceptions (b) and (c). Mr Lye
                    agreed under cross-examination that Exception (c) was deleted because of the
                    “Risk No 001” Clause, which extended the definition of a
                    “workman” to include “all employees of insured and all
                    tiers subcontractors”:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now… can you look at Extension [<em>sic</em>] (c): “Any employee of the insured

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Furthermore Mr Lye also accepted that
                    Exception (b) was deleted to prevent conflict with Endorsement B (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> to <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>

                            question. <em>So if it has not been deleted, would it be
                                inconsistent with Endorsement B, that is his
                            question</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Oh. <em>Insured liability – er,
                                yes, if it’s not deleted, then it’s

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In addition, as the definition of
                    “Insured” in the “Name of Insured” Clause included
                    all the sub-contractors involved in the project, it would have been
                    contradictory for Exception (b) to remain undeleted in the WC
                Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is therefore clear that the deletions of
                    Exceptions (b) and (c) were to make the WC Policy consistent with the additions
                    of the “Name of Insured” Clause, the “Risk No 001”
                    Clause and Endorsement B. As such, they do not take the defendant’s case
                    any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Contra Proferentem</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In addition, the defendant submits since the
                    WC Policy is ambiguous, the <em>contra proferentem</em>
                    rule should apply, and any ambiguity should be resolved against the Insurer as
                    the party who drafted it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> rule, however, is an aid to the construction of
                    ambiguous documents: it does not permit the artificial creation of an ambiguity
                    in order to reach a particular result (<em>Colinvaux</em>
                    at para 3-10, n 67). Even where a clause is ambiguous taken alone, the
                        <em>contra proferentem</em> rule does not apply if its
                    meaning becomes clear in the context of the overall policy (<em>Colinvaux</em> at para 3-10, n 69).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Here, the ambiguity is allegedly created by
                    the “Name of Insured” Clause, but the ambiguity can be resolved by
                    considering the entire policy, and the <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> rule should not be used to import any such ambiguity
                    into the Operative Clause and thereby magnify it: <em>Cornish v
                        The Accident Insurance Company Limited</em> (1889)
                    23 QBD 453, 456 <em>per</em> Lindley LJ and

                    Auld LJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Further, if a <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> interpretation leads to inconsistency within the
                    contract, and/or an unreasonable result, that defeats the aim of ascertaining
                    the true construction of the WC Policy, which is to determine the objective
                    intention of the parties as understood by a reasonable observer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     A <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> construction of the WC Policy, along the lines
                    advocated by the defendant, runs into these objections, as a consideration of
                    Endorsement B reveals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Endorsement B</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Before I begin my analysis of the
                    Insurer’s submission on Endorsement B, I should add that the
                    defendant’s reliance on the various arguments set out above have not
                    displaced the plain and ordinary meaning of the Operative Clause: namely, that
                    the WC Policy only indemnifies any of the Insured, including the defendant,
                    against liabilities to workmen actually employed by such Insured. It does not
                    cover indemnity claims in respect of liabilities incurred at common law to
                    workmen employed by sub-contractors. On these findings, it is sufficient to
                    dispose of the claim by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Nevertheless, I shall consider the
                    Insurer’s argument that the addition of Endorsement B effectively
                    demolishes the defendant’s construction of the WC Policy. Endorsement B
                    provides, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is hereby understood and agreed that the indemnity herein granted is
                        intended to cover the legal liability of the Insured to workmen in the
                        employment of contractors performing work for the Insured while engaged in
                        the business and occupation in respect of which the within policy is granted
                            <em>but only so far as regards Claims under any
                            Workmen’s Compensation Act</em> Cap 354 for the time
                        being in force in the Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Insurer’s submission is simple and
                    straightforward. It is to be noted that Endorsement B specifically covers
                    “workmen in the employment of contractors performing work for the
                    Insured”, but is limited to claims by workmen under the Act. Endorsement
                    B is intended to be an extension of the WC Policy to cover workmen compensation
                    claims under the Act by workmen of any contractor whoever may be the employer.
                    However, according to the defendant, by virtue of the various other clauses of
                    the WC Policy (<em>eg</em> the Interpretation Clause, the
                    “Name of Insured” Clause and the “Risk No 001”
                    Clause, above), Utracon and all other sub-contractors are deemed, together with
                    the defendant, to collectively be the “contractor” and hence the
                    “Insured”. If this is right, the Insurer submits, then there is no
                    point in making a separate provision, via Endorsement B, for “workmen in
                    the employment of contractors performing work for the Insured” if this is
                    already achieved by the Operative Clause on the true construction of the WC
                    Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Clearly, Endorsement B must have been intended
                    for a different purpose. According to Mr Lye, Endorsement B is a specific
                    requirement by the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”). In fact, it
                    is expressly stated in Memorandum 3 of the WC Policy that Endorsement B is
                    applicable to the LTA. Under s 17 of the Act, workmen of sub-contractors
                    have a statutory right of action against the main contractor for workmen’s
                    compensation as if the workman had been employed by the main
                contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Counsel for the Insurer submits that
                    Endorsement B was added to the WC Policy to enable employees of the LTA to claim
                    for workmen’s compensation under the Act. The Insurer submits that the
                    employees of the defendant and its sub-contractors including Utracon need not
                    rely on Endorsement B since they have a statutory right of action under
                    s 17 of the Act. As explained in <em>Awang bin
                        Dollah</em> at [57], the purpose of s 17 of the Act is to enable
                    the workman to bypass the privity of contract between the main contractor and
                    the sub-contractor. However in order for s 17 to apply, the workman must be
                    employed in the execution of works pursuant to a contract between the main
                    contractor and the sub-contractor for the purposes of carrying out works
                    undertaken by the main contractor. An employee of the LTA who is injured at the
                    worksite would not be performing any work pursuant to a sub-contract between the
                    LTA and the main contractor, and accordingly would not be entitled to rely on
                    s 17 of the Act to claim for workmen’s compensation against the main
                    contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In my view, Endorsement B was not added only
                    for the benefit of the LTA. After all, Endorsement B plainly refers to the
                    “Insured”, which, as defined in the “Name of
                    Insured” Clause, includes a number of different parties. Instead, it is
                    Endorsement A that was added for the benefit of the LTA (and M/s Kim Teck
                    Leong (Pte) Ltd), as Endorsement A provides that the Insurer will indemnify the
                    “principal” against a claim under the Act by any workman employed
                    by the “Insured or the Insured’s Contractors”. In my
                    opinion, Endorsement B was added to permit the relevant Insured (including but
                    not limited to the LTA) to claim an indemnity against the Insurer for
                    workmen’s compensation paid under the Act to workmen who were not its
                    employees so long as such workmen were performing work for any of the
                    contractors or sub-contractors at the time of the accident. Such a claim without
                    Endorsement B would otherwise not be payable under the Operative
                Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     However, the extension under Endorsement B
                    applies <em>only</em> in respect of <em>workmen’s compensation claims under the Act</em> by
                    “workmen in the employment of contractors performing work for the Insured
                        [<em>ie</em> the defendant]”. Therefore, an
                    indemnity cannot be obtained in respect of <em>common law
                        claims</em>, such as occupier’s liability, against the Insured
                        (<em>ie</em> the defendant) by workmen in the
                    employment of contractors engaged by the Insured (<em>ie</em> the defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Technically, however, even though workmen of
                    sub-contractors (such as the plaintiff) have a statutory right of action against
                    the defendant under s 17 of the Act, without Endorsement B, the defendant
                    would not be able to claim an indemnity from the Insurer, since the Operative
                    Clause refers to a “workman in the Insured’s [<em>ie</em> the defendant’s] employment”. It is not the
                    workmen of sub-contractors (or of the LTA) who have to rely on Endorsement B in
                    order to claim an indemnity against the defendant: they rely on their rights at
                    common law as modified by statute to do so, rather than on an insurance contract
                    between the defendant and the Insurer which cannot confer any rights on them. It
                    is the defendant who must rely on Endorsement B in order to claim an indemnity
                    from the Insurer in the event of a successful claim against it under the Act by
                    “workmen in the employment of contractors performing work for
                    [it]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     A consideration of Endorsement B therefore
                    demonstrates that, in the context of the entire WC Policy, the defendant’s
                    suggested construction cannot be sustained, as it would have the effect of
                    rendering Endorsement B either otiose or contradictory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It appears to me that the defendant and its
                    insurance broker believed that the WC Policy was sufficiently comprehensive to
                    embrace the present indemnity claim. However genuine their belief may be, the
                    task of the court is to construe the terms of the insurance policy in order to
                    determine its scope and whether on its true construction the indemnity claimed
                    by the defendant is payable. Unfortunately for the defendant, the WC Policy only
                    responds to indemnity claims brought by any of the Insured in respect of
                    liability incurred at common law or under the Act to its employees. It does not
                    respond to common law claims (as opposed to claims under the Act, which are
                    brought within and covered by the WC Policy as a result of Endorsement B)
                    brought by non-employees against the Insured as occupier of the worksite. While
                    this may seem like an anomalous lacuna, as explained by counsel for the Insurer,
                    it is always possible for the defendant or any insured to procure a policy to
                    cover the current situation. That could be achieved, for example, by deleting
                    the proviso ”<em>but only so far as regards Claims under
                        any Workmen’s Compensation Act Cap 354 for the time being in
                        force”</em> from Endorsement B. Obviously there are other ways
                    to arrange insurance to cover the present situation. It is ultimately a question
                    of pricing, <em>ie</em> the premium.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the result, the claim by the defendant
                    against the Insurer is dismissed with costs to be taxed if not
                agreed.</p>
