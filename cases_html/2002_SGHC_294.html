<b xmlns=""><font face="Univers" size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Introduction</font></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        This was an appeal by the defendant against the

decision of the District Court which dismissed her appeal against the decision of the

Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts. In the result, she failed to strike out this

action pursuant to Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of Court on the ground that the claim

disclosed no reasonable cause of action. At the conclusion of the appeal, I allowed the

appeal and struck out the action on the ground that the matters complained of in the

statement of claim was protected by absolute privilege and the defamation action must fail

in limine. I set aside all orders below and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant

costs fixed at $4,000. Though there are no further proceedings, I am setting out the

grounds in deference to the thoughtful grounds of decision of the District Judge.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The plaintiff was a former client of the

defendant’s employer, Messrs R Rajandran, Joseph &amp; Nayar, a law firm ("the

Firm"). The defendant is a secretary of the Firm. Her employer is Mr Ignatius Joseph

who is married to Ms Suja Susan Thomas. Ms Audrey Tan Hui Yee is a secretary of the Firm. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The defendant, Madam Toh Laye Lan (Zhuo Lilan)

("Madam Toh") had commenced another action against the plaintiff Madam Dolly

Niranjan ("Madam Niranjan") in D C Suit No. 1151 of 2002/p on 15 March 2002. In

that action, Madam Toh claimed against Madam Niranjan damages for publishing defamatory

works that meant or were understood to mean that Madam Toh was having a sexual

relationship and/or immoral relationship with Mr Joseph Ignatius. The alleged publications

referred to were allegedly made on three separate occasions. Prior to the defamation

action the solicitors of Madam Toh wrote a letter of demand dated 8 February 2002 to Madam

Niranjan. The letter set out the defamatory words published of Madam Toh and demanded

damages for the slander and an undertaking not to repeat them. As could be seen from the

contents of the letter of demand, Madam Niranjan was aware of the identity of the

witnesses who Madam Toh would call to prove her case. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        A day after the writ was filed in the

Subordinate Courts, i.e. on or about 16 March 2002 Madam Niranjan by telephone called the

office of the Firm and spoke to Ms Audrey Tan Hui Yee on two occasions. In both

conversations, she uttered words to the effect that Madam Toh was up to some dirty tricks,

suggesting that Madam Toh in fact had no claim against her. According to Madam Toh, Madam

Niranjan also attempted to talk to Mr Joseph Ignatius on his mobile phone on 15 March

2002, though she did not succeed. It should be pointed out this was denied by Madam

Niranjan. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        Correspondence followed these episodes over the

telephone and it gave rise to the second action in DC 1525 of 2002 which was, this time

round, commenced by Madam Niranjan against Madam Toh. On 18 March 2002 Madam Toh’s

solicitors wrote a letter to Madam Niranjan’s solicitors. It was in these terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Our clients (i.e. Madam

    Toh)instructs us that your client (i.e. Madam Niranjan) had been repeatedly calling our

    client’s witnesses and has been attempting to harass as well as intimidate them. It

    is our client’s view that this amounts to tampering with and harassing the witnesses.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Kindly advise your client to

    cease and desist from such activities failing which our client would have no recourse but

    to make appropriate application to court as she may be advised."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The issue</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The issue in this case is whether the letter of

18 March 2002 was made in the course of judicial proceedings and for the purpose of

judicial proceedings. If the answer is in the affirmative in both respects in relation to

judicial proceedings, it enjoys absolute privilege and the present defamation action based

on the letter must be struck out.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The decision of the District

Judge</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The District Judge rightly set out the

applicable law. He held that the letter could only enjoy privilege if it was made in the

course of, and for the purpose of either of both sets of proceedings in the District

Court, that is the earlier action in DC 1511 of 2002 or proceedings (contemplated or

otherwise) in respect of the complained act of intimidation and tampering of witnesses. In

relation to the question which was the relevant proceedings, the District Judge decided

that it was the intended proceedings against Madam Niranjan for the complained acts of

harassment and intimidation of witnesses, and not the earlier action in DC Suit 1511 of

2002. Since there was no proceedings (whether civil or criminal) taken out at the date of

the hearing before the District Judge, nor was there any evidence before him that any such

proceedings were contemplated, the letter in his view could not be said to be made in the

course of proceedings: see paras 27 and 43 of his grounds of decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        The District Judge further noted that the

letter could be said to have been made in the course of the earlier proceedings in DC Suit

1511 of 2002, seeing that it was written after the commencement of the action. However, he

was of the view that the letter, strictly speaking, was not made for the purpose of the

earlier proceedings, because "the accusation that Madam Niranjan was harassing and

intimidating Madam Toh’s witnesses and tampering with their evidence was strictly

speaking, irrelevant to the issues in the earlier action for defamation": see para 48

</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">My reasons</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        My analysis of the letter in question differed

from that of the District Judge. In answering the question whether it was written

"for the purpose of the proceedings" it had to be asked, it seemed to me,

whether the letter was written by solicitors in an attempt to protect the client’s

interest in the proceedings and further whether it had the immediate link with the

proceedings. In <i>Waple v Surrey Country Council</i> [1998] 1 All ER 624, Brooke LJ set

out some instructive guidance on the modern rules about absolute privilege conferred on

statements made in the course of judicial proceedings. First, he noted that for over 100

years the courts had been very slow to extend the scope of the privilege. The width of the

absolute privilege depended on ‘the requirement of public policy to ensure freedom of

speech in a context in which it was essential that such freedom of speech should

exist’ which was accompanied by ‘the knowledge that Courts of justice are

presided over by those who from their high character are not likely to abuse the

privilege, and who have the power and ought to have the will to check any abuse of it by

those who appear before them’, per Lopes LJ in <i>Royal Aquarium and Summer and

Winder Garden Society Ltd v Parkinson</i> [1892]1 QB 431, at 451.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        It was further noted by Brookes LJ that <i>In

Watson v M’Ewan, Watson v Jones</i> [1905] AC 480 the House of Lords extended the

scope of the privilege to statements made by a witness to the client and solicitor in

preparing a case for trial. The Earl of Halsbury LC pointed out that if this was not the

case, witnesses would be very reluctant to give any such information for fear of a libel

suit, and that it was very obvious that the public policy which rendered the protection of

witnesses necessary for the administration of justice must as a necessary consequence

involve that which is a step towards and is part of the administration of justice. The

Lord Chancellor referred to the hardship which would arise if it were impossible to

administer justice because people would be afraid to give their testimony. The harassment

of witnesses has the potential of causing deleterious effect on the administration of

justice, which depends on witnesses telling the truth without fear.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        I considered the letter in the context of the

earlier defamation suit in the Subordinate Courts. Madam Toh, to the knowledge of Madam

Niranjan, would clearly and demonstrably depend on the witnesses, both Audrey Tan and Mr

Joseph Ignatius, to prove the defamatory slander uttered by Madam Niranjan. They should

not be spoken to in any manner which could interfere with their willingness to tell the

truth in the course of the trial of those proceedings. The letter required Madam Niranjan

to refrain from any further harassment and tampering of witness or an application would be

made. That application must refer to a complaint to the Subordinate Court in the earlier

proceedings with a view to citing Madam Niranjan for contempt of court. Such harassment

maybe checked by the Subordinate Court under the earlier defamation suit taken out by

Madam Toh. In those circumstances, I concluded that the letter was written in the course,

and for the purposes, of those proceedings. Accordingly, the letter was written on an

occasion of absolute privilege.</font></p>
