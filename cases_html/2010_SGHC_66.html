<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Summons No 76 of 2010 was an application by
                    the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth
                    defendant (the “relevant defendants”) under s 14 of the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and O 45
                    r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) for the court to direct that any Assistant Registrar
                    and/or the Registrar of the Supreme Court may sign the share transfer forms that
                    give effect to the completion of the sale and purchase of the plaintiff’s
                    shares in the first defendant to the second, third and/or the fourth defendant
                    and/or their respective nominees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By consent of the parties, this court earlier
                    ordered on 27 April 2009 (the “Consent Order”) that the
                    second, third and/or fourth defendant and/or their respective nominees purchase
                    the plaintiff’s shares in the first defendant at a fair value to be
                    determined by an independent valuer, of whose valuation report setting out the
                    fair value of the plaintiff’s share would be final and binding on all
                    parties. The valuer was appointed on 27 May 2009. Whilst the original
                    timeline for the issuance of the valuation report was 24 June 2009, it was
                    finally issued on 8 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Consent Order prescribed that the completion
                    of the sale and purchase of the plaintiff’ shares take place within three
                    weeks after the valuation report is furnished, in this case, on 29 December
                    2009. However, this had not taken place even though the relevant
                    defendants’ solicitors had on 11 December 2009 and 22 December
                    2009 written to the plaintiff’s solicitors to request completion of the
                    sale and purchase and offered to tender a cashier’s order as payment for
                    the shares at the relevant defendants’ solicitors’ office. Due to
                    the plaintiff’s previous solicitor being away and the subsequent change of
                    solicitors, the plaintiff did not respond to the relevant defendants’
                    request for completion directly and his new solicitors on 30 December 2009
                    requested for more time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Specifically on 30 December 2009, the
                    plaintiff’s newly appointed solicitors wrote to the relevant
                    defendants’ solicitors requesting that the relevant defendants refrain
                    from taking any action against the plaintiff and that they would respond to the
                    relevant defendants’ solicitors’ 22 December 2009 letter by the
                    end of the following week. The relevant defendants agreed to give the plaintiff
                    more time and a fresh request was sent to the plaintiff’s newly appointed
                    solicitors by the relevant defendants’ solicitors for the completion of
                    the sale and purchase of the shares by 5 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       However, when 5 January 2010 arrived, the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors requested, once again, for more time and the
                    completion of the sale and purchase did not take place. The relevant defendants
                    then made this application to effect completion of the sale and purchase of the
                    shares ordered under the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s counsel first raised what
                    he considered to be an obstacle to this application. He submitted that a summons
                    cannot be filed on Suit No 53 of 2008 as the applicant was obliged to file
                    a fresh originating summons or writ according to <em>Indian
                        Overseas Bank v Motorcycle Industries</em> (<em>1973</em>) <em>Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [1992]
                    3 SLR(R) 841 (“<em>IOB v Motorcycle
                        Industries</em>”). Having read this case closely, I did not
                    think it had any direct bearing to this application to enforce a consent
                    judgment in accordance with O 45 r 8 of the ROC and indicated this to
                    both counsel. <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>
                    supported the proposition that a Consent Order’s effects are to put an end
                    to the proceedings, preclude the parties from taking further steps in the action
                    and to supersede the original cause of action altogether (at [12] and [13]).
                    What is sought in this application by summons is the performance of the Consent
                    Order and not the original cause of action. I therefore find the
                    plaintiff’s submission to be unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s solicitors informed the
                    court, that the plaintiff wished to challenge the valuation report and was thus
                    anxious to resist this application under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. They
                    disclosed that they were actively engaged with experts to commence legal action
                    to challenge the valuation report. There is no obstacle to the plaintiff
                    challenging the valuation report in a separate legal action. The
                    defendant’s counsel pointed out to the court that no legal action had been
                    filed by the plaintiff to date. Plaintiff’s counsel then replied that that
                    they would file their originating summons immediately, <em>ie</em>, on 19 January 2010. In the light of this, I indicated
                    to counsel that I would consider both summonses together before finalizing my
                    decisions. However, it transpired the next day, on 20 January 2010, that
                    the plaintiff’s application to file the originating summons on
                    19 January 2010 was rejected by the Registrar and the subsequent
                    originating summons filed was fixed to be heard on 23 February 2010. In
                    light of this, I decided to issue my decision on the present summons granting an
                    order in terms in favour of the relevant defendants. The plaintiff’s
                    counsel applied for further arguments and I heard both counsel again on
                    26 February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 26 February 2010, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel raised the argument for the first time that where an order for specific
                    performance of a contract is sought, a separate application for specific
                    performance is required under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. Plaintiff’s
                    counsel argued that the relevant defendants’ application here was not
                    available under O 45 r 8 of the ROC. Plaintiff’s counsel cited
                        <em>P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 582 in support of his argument but
                    when invited to explain whether there was any proposition of law in that case
                    which assisted him, he was obliged to concede that there were
                none.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       O 45 r 8 of the ROC reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a Mandatory Order, an injunction or a judgment or order for the
                        specific performance of a contract is not complied with, then without
                        prejudice to its power under section 14 of the Supreme Court of
                        Judicature Act (Chapter 322), where applicable, and its power to punish
                        the disobedient party for contempt, the Court may direct that the act
                        required to be done may, so far as practicable, be done by the party by whom
                        the order or judgment was obtained or some other person appointed by the
                        Court, at the cost of the disobedient party, and upon the act being done the
                        expenses incurred may be ascertained in such manner as the Court may direct
                        and execution may issue against the disobedient party for the amount so
                        ascertained and for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plain reading of O 45 r 8 of the ROC, in particular, the
                    disjunctive “or” in the first line of the rule, which includes
                    “judgments” and presumably consent orders of court, were pointed
                    out to him as being contrary to his construction. He had no response. When asked
                    whether he was submitting that a Consent Order can only be enforced under
                    O 45 r 8 of the ROC by a further action and another court order and to
                    provide any other authorities in support of this, he was obliged to concede that
                    he could find none.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Seeing no merit in any of the arguments run by
                    the plaintiff’s counsel and having formed a conclusion from the chronology
                    of events and nature of his submissions and replies, I concluded that the
                    plaintiff’s attempts to resist the application pursuant to O 45
                    r 8 of the ROC was a strategy to buy time for his separate legal actions to
                    challenge the valuation report. The plaintiff is at all times at liberty to file
                    these actions and make appropriate applications. There were no substantive legal
                    grounds for me not to grant the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the
                    relevant defendants’ application and granted order in terms their
                    prayers 1 and 2, namely that:</p>

                            the first defendant as provided for under the terms of the Consent
