<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a construction
                    dispute that was tried in two tranches in 2006 after which
                    the court awarded interlocutory judgment in favour of
                    Compact Metal Industries Ltd (“the plaintiff”)
                    and ordered damages to be assessed against PPG Industries
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the defendant”) in the
                    plaintiff’s favour. Damages were subsequently assessed
                    by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) for the
                    plaintiff’s claim. The parties were subcontractors in
                    a project of which Taisei Corporation
                    (‘Taisei”) was the main
                contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant appealed in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 43 of 2010 (“the
                    defendant’s appeal”) to set aside and/or
                    reverse various awards of damages made by the AR while the
                    plaintiff cross-appealed in Registrar’s Appeal No 49
                    of 2010 (“the plaintiff’s appeal”)
                    against the AR’s decision in refusing to order that
                    the defendant indemnify the plaintiff against any liquidated
                    damages that may be payable by the plaintiff to
                    Taisei.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The two Appeals came up for
                    hearing before me. At their conclusion, I dismissed the
                    defendant’s appeal but allowed the plaintiff’s
                    appeal. I held that the plaintiff was entitled to be
                    reimbursed by the defendant for any liquidated damages
                    recovered by Taisei from the plaintiff. As the defendant has
                    appealed against the whole of my decision (in Civil Appeal
                    No 125 of 2011), I shall now set out my
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties were involved in
                    the refurbishment of the Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”) Building in 2004 (“the
                    project”). As stated earlier, the project’s
                    main contractor was Taisei. A company known as Facade Master
                    Pte Ltd (“Facade”) was appointed as the
                    nominated subcontractor for the supply and installation of
                    the external cladding. Facade is a subsidiary of the
                    plaintiff. Facade appointed the plaintiff to paint the
                    aluminium panels to be used in the external cladding. The
                    plaintiff in turn engaged another subsidiary Compact Metal
                    Industries Sdn Bhd (“Compact Malaysia”) to
                    carry out the painting work. Facade also contracted with yet
                    another subsidiary of the plaintiff called Aluform Marketing
                    Singapore Pte Ltd to fabricate the facade fins. It further
                    contracted with Rotol Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Rotol”) to do the coating works for the
                    facade fins. Finally, Facade subcontracted out to Citiwall
                    Installer Pte Ltd (“Citiwall”) the external
                    cladding works <em>viz</em>
                    installation of the panels and facade fins.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The paint for the aluminium
                    panels was to be supplied by the defendant. However,
                        th<b>e</b> paint was not an
                    ordinary paint. It was a customised paint that was featured
                    in the defendant’s standard colour charts. It emerged
                    during the course of the trial that the composition of the
                    paint that was initially supplied was unique and had not
                    previously been used. The defendant would only sell such
                    paints to those it had approved as applicators. Compact
                    Malaysia had been such an approved applicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Considerable difficulties
                    were encountered by the defendant in achieving an acceptable
                    and consistent finish with the paint that it initially
                    supplied to the plaintiff. That paint was known as
                    ‘Redwood Metallic’ (“the original
                    paint”). This resulted in the parties seeking the
                    approval of the project’s architects (RSP Architects,
                    Planners &amp; Engineers (Pte) Ltd) (“RSP”) to
                    change the formulation of the paint, which approval was
                    secured. Even then, it was only after many months of trial,
                    error and adjustment that <b>s</b>atisfactory quality of the paint was achieved.
                    The plaintiff’s first attempt to replace the original
                    paint with ‘Redwood Metallic II’ (“the
                    second paint”) during the period October to December
                    2004 was similarly rejected. The paint that was eventually
                    accepted and used for the panels was called ‘Redwood
                    Metallic III’ (“the new paint”). Not
                    surprisingly, due to the paint problem, the original
                    completion date of 13 October 2004 was not met. The
                    project was only completed 9 months or 273 days later on
                    13 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The central question for the
                    trial judge was, who should be responsible for the
                    consequential loss and damages that resulted from the
                    delayed completion of the project due to the difficulties
                    involved in achieving an acceptable tonality for the paint
                    applied to the panels?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After a 13 days’ trial
                    involving seven witnesses including an expert, the trial
                    judge held that the original paint supplied by the defendant
                    was not in accordance with the conditions of the sale
                    contract between the parties and that the plaintiff was
                    entitled to reject the same and treat the contract as
                    discharged. However, it was open to the plaintiff to affirm
                    the contract subject to the defendant remedying the breach
                    in an acceptable manner. In either case, the plaintiff was
                    entitled to damages for the defendant’s breach of
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Accordingly, the trial judge
                    awarded interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiff
                    and costs with damages payable to the plaintiff to be
                    assessed by the Assistant Registrar
                    (“AR”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Assessment of damages due
                    to the plaintiff took place in three tranches totalling 18
                    days:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     15 to

                        2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the end of the three
                    tranches, the AR awarded $2,842,102.08 to the plaintiff in
                    January 2010 comprising of:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Besides appealing against
                    the damages awarded for the various items above, the
                    defendant also appealed against the costs awarded to the
                    plaintiff on a standard basis (to be taxed if not agreed).
                    The defendant argued that such costs should be paid by the
                    plaintiff instead. The only items that the defendant did not
                    appeal against were (i) Rotol’s recoating costs of
                    $109,670.02 and (ii) the plaintiff’s transport costs
                    of $60,458.00. At the hearing before me however, counsel for
                    the defendant informed the court he was withdrawing his
                    client’s appeal in relation to purchase orders works
                    and additional scaffolding costs of $113,018.84 at
                    [11(c)(i)] above. Counsel added that he left it to the court
                    to decide on labour costs at [11(c)(ii)]
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     For the assessment
                    hearing, both parties called expert witnesses whose
                    testimonies featured prominently in their appeals. The
                    plaintiff’s experts on the issues of delay and quantum
                    were Pickavance and Anand Jude Anthony
                    (“Anthony”) respectively while the
                    defendant’s experts on the same issues were Thomas
                    Anthony Harker (“Harker”) and Hardcastle
                    respectively. The factual witnesses who appeared for the
                    plaintiff were: (i) Tan Hua Joo (“Tan”) the
                    plaintiff’s executive director who is also
                    Compact’s managing-director; (ii) Ling King Hwa
                    (“Ling”), the general manager of Compact; and
                    (iii) Eric Lo Shek Sum (“Lo”), Facade’s
                    former general manager. I should add that both for the trial
                    on liability as well as the assessment hearings, the
                    plaintiff and its subsidiaries were treated by the court
                    collectively as a single entity under the plaintiff’s
                    umbrella although (at the assessment stage) the defendant
                    took a contrary stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At this juncture, it would
                    be appropriate to look at the lengthy arguments that were
                    presented by the parties for their respective appeals. I
                    start first with the submissions for the defendant’s
                    appeal, which correspond chronologically with the respective
                    heads of claims listed at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   The award of $171,944.40 for excess
                labour charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant pointed out
                    that the AR had made this award on the basis that the
                    quantum was attributable to the need to produce newly coated
                    panels. The defendant argued that Anthony had computed the
                    excess labour charges as wasted costs whereas Hardcastle had
                    considered such costs as the plaintiff’s costs
                    incurred in rectifying the rejected panels and they should
                    not include the cost of producing the original rejected
                    panels. Consequently, the defendant submitted that the
                    plaintiff should not have been given this
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant submitted
                    that Hardcastle’s proposition was correct at law and
                    should be accepted, citing <em>Hong Fok
                        Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 (“<em>Hong Fok Realty</em>”). As Facade and
                    Compact Malaysia would be paid their contractual dues for
                    fabrication of panels and application of paint, the
                    plaintiff should not be paid for the same items. Hardcastle
                    had given due regard to rectification costs incurred by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff on the other
                    hand submitted that the AR had accepted Anthony’s
                    assessment that 16,704.47 sq m of coated panels were
                    delivered as of December 2004 followed by 4,788.58 sq m
                    delivered between January and July 2005. Based on the
                    (undisputed) labour charge of both Compact Malaysia and
                    Rotol of $8 per sq m, the total labour cost was therefore
                    $171,944.40 [(16,704.47 + 4,788.58 = 21,493.05 sq m x $8)].
                    Anthony’s assessment was supported by invoices and
                    delivery orders (which the AR had accepted) and was also
                    based on Citiwall’s progress claims. The evidence
                    showed that there were substantial excess quantities of
                    panels that the plaintiff had to recoat due to the
                    defendant’s original defective paint. Consequently,
                    this item of claim was clearly within the contemplation of
                    the parties as coming within the first limb of recovery
                    under the seminal English case of <em>Hadley
                        v Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch 341
                        (“<em>Hadley v
                        Baxendale</em>”). The plaintiff pointed out
                    that Hardcastle in his evidence did not dispute the
                    plaintiff’s entitlement to the claim but only the
                    quantum assessed by Anthony. The plaintiff accused
                    Hardcastle of having been selective in looking at source
                    documents by relying only on certain invoices and the final
                    accounts between the plaintiff and Taisei. In so doing,
                    Hardcastle arrived at a minimal quantity reflecting
                    recoating works. According to the plaintiff,
                    Hardcastle’s approach was seriously flawed. The
                    plaintiff also relied on the case cited by the defendant
                    –
                    <em>Hong Fok Realty</em> at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> for its opposite
                    contention that the plaintiff was entitled to claim all
                    wasted expenditure relating to the abortive costs of
                    applying the original paint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Recoating costs of $590,614.42</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Compact Malaysia’s recoating costs
                of $153,086.08</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant heavily
                    criticised Anthony’s testimony as being riddled with
                    inconsistencies and contended his analysis was flawed while
                    his claims were unsubstantiated and amounted to
                    double-counting. The defendant complained that apart from
                    741.2 sq m (which was accepted by Hardcastle), the plaintiff
                    had not produced any corroborative evidence to support the
                    figure of 5,887.93 sq m as the quantity of panels that
                    Compact Malaysia had sanded down and recoated.
                    Hardcastle’s figure for rectification costs was
                    $16,204.65. In any case, the defendant argued that Facade
                    and Compact Malaysia had arrived at a commercial settlement
                    on the paint application works. The final accounts between
                    Facade and Compact Malaysia were binding on the plaintiff
                    and there was no claim therein by Compact Malaysia for
                    recoating works. Compact Malaysia’s unit rate of $26
                    per sq m was also incorrect; it should be Rotol’s rate
                    of $15.40 per sq m. The AR therefore had no evidence to
                    arrive at the award of $153,086.08 in favour of Compact
                    Malaysia for recoating costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff countered
                    the defendant’s arguments by again criticising
                    Hardcastle’s reports as selectively using the final
                    accounts of Compact Malaysia in his finding that there could
                    only be minimal quantity of recoating works undertaken since
                    Compact Malaysia did not claim for recoating costs. However,
                    Hardcastle then looked at a few invoices to substantiate the
                    small quantity of recoating works (3,153.4 sq m) he had
                    assessed. Had Hardcastle looked at all the source documents
                        <em>viz</em> the invoices and the
                    endorsed delivery orders, it would have become immediately
                    apparent to him that the quantities of recoating he had
                    assessed could not stand. Despite his concession that those
                    source documents were not suspicious, Hardcastle did not
                    accept them (unlike the AR) notwithstanding his claim that
                    he had ‘processed’ them to allow him to have an
                    idea of how the application works had
                progressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff raised a
                    pertinent point – it would be pointless to deliver
                    panels to site unless they were coated. Consequently, all
                    panels delivered to site must have been coated. Hence, the
                    panels delivered must reflect the total quantity of panels
                    that were coated and delivered to site. The plaintiff also
                    pointed out that progress claims would only reflect
                    installed panels as opposed to coated and delivered panels.
                    The plaintiff added that Tan (see above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) had testified that
                    recoating costs would not be found in the final accounts
                    between Compact Malaysia and Facade because Compact Malaysia
                    would not be claiming recoating costs from Facade.
                    Logically, the claim would be made against the plaintiff who
                    had supplied the original paint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As for the recoating
                    rates, the plaintiff explained that initially it was Compact
                    Malaysia that undertook the recoating works and invoiced
                    Facade at $26 per sq m for the work. It was only in March
                    2005 when Compact was occupied with coating panels with the
                    new paint that Facade decided to subcontract the recoating
                    of internal panels to Rotol at a lower rate of $15.40 per sq
                    m. Anthony adopted (after verification) the actual rates
                    charged for recoating by Compact Malaysia and Rotol and they
                    were accepted by the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Compact Malaysia’s recoating
                costs of $140,967.58 (between Oct-Dec 2004)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendant repeated its
                    foregoing submissions based on Hardcastle’s testimony.
                    It was argued that the AR had no definitive material to
                    arrive at the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff explained
                    that this was a period when there were numerous trials
                    conducted by the defendant with the new paint to ensure it
                    would achieve a consistent finish. The consistent finish was
                    only achieved in mid-November 2004 through the efforts of
                    Compact Malaysia but there were still colour issues until
                    December 2004, due primarily to the defendant’s breach
                    of the “single batch requirement” dealt with
                    and accepted by the trial judge. The recoating cost of
                    $140,967.58 (<em>ie</em>, $26 x
                    5,421.83) was for panels that were recoated during the trial
                    period as the second paint was still
                unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Rotol’s recoating cost of
                $186,890.74</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant complained
                    that Anthony in his AEIC did not explain why the defendant
                    must bear this charge for re-fabrication and recoating of
                    panels based on a unit price of $89 per sq m for 2,099.89 sq
                    m. It submitted that Anthony’s explanation in
                    re-examination was wholly unconvincing. The defendant argued
                    that the tonality issue was resolved by mid-November 2004
                    after which the plaintiff was able to achieve consistency in
                    its paint application. Yet, Anthony had testified that
                    2,099.89 sq m of panels were sent by Compact Malaysia to
                    Rotol for recoating. The defendant submitted that there was
                    nothing in Anthony’s evidence which supported the
                    plaintiff’s contention that those costs arose from the
                    use of the original paint. Anthony’s assessment was at
                    best speculative and as there was no adequate evidence to
                    support this claim, the plaintiff should only be awarded
                    nominal damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff pointed out
                    that Rotol’s recoating costs charged to the defendant
                    were based on the contractual rate and that Anthony did not
                    include subsequent recoating costs incurred by Rotol for the
                    defendant. Accordingly, there was no basis for the
                    defendant’s complaint. The plaintiff referred to a
                    letter dated 20 October 2004 from the plaintiff to
                    Taisei attempting to persuade the latter to retain the
                    internal panels coated with the original paint as
                    dismantling those panels would cause previously installed
                    panels to be damaged beyond repair and deprive the plaintiff
                    of the opportunity to recoat those panels. The
                    plaintiff’s request, however, was
                rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Additionally, the
                    plaintiff pointed out that Hardcastle had confirmed seeing
                    proof of damaged panels. As such, if the damage to the
                    panels was attributable to the dismantling process and
                    dismantling was necessitated by the rejection of the
                    original paint applied to the panels, the cost of
                    fabricating and recoating replacement panels must be borne
                    by the defendant. Hardcastle (who, according to the
                    plaintiff, ignored contemporaneous evidence or used them
                    selectively when it suited his purpose) was thus in no
                    position to challenge Anthony’s findings which were
                    based on verification of fabrication records. There were
                    also the testimonies of Tan and Ling from Compact Malaysia
                    in relation to the different ways in which the claims of a
                    fabricator, a paint applicator and/or a panel installer were
                    to be assessed.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Relying heavily again on
                    Hardcastle’s testimony, the defendant criticised
                    Anthony’s evidence. First, Anthony had conceded that a
                    sum of $127,481.98 should be deducted from his quantum for
                    dismantling and reinstatement costs for fins because the sum
                    was due to a late variation order. Anthony allegedly made
                    the concession in response to Hardcastle’s comment
                    that no fins of significant quantities were coated until
                    November 2004. That also meant that no coated fins were
                    dismantled or available for erection on site until November
                    2004. Hardcastle’s view was that the panelling works
                    should have stopped after Taisei’s notifications of 25
                    and 26 June 2004 of the tonality problems. Second,
                    Taisei had emailed the plaintiff on 11 August 2004 to
                    stop installation works pending resolution of the tonality
                    issue. Facade had also informed Taisei on 17 September
                    2004 that the internal panels on the
                        30<sup>th</sup> floor needed
                    replacements for which 15 weeks were required for
                    completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant submitted
                    that Hardcastle had assessed the dismantling and
                    reinstallation costs as $43,018.84 which was the exact same
                    sum that Citiwall had claimed as variation works (or PO
                    Works) in its final accounts with Facade. Hardcastle had
                    also made a concession of $70,000 for scaffolding erected by
                    a company called Citiwall Façade, an award to the plaintiff
                    which the defendant did not dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff countered
                    the above arguments by pointing out that the AR had accepted
                    the final accounts of Citiwall and had allowed the sum
                    therein of $43,018.84, a figure both Anthony and Hardcastle
                    accepted. Since the defendant did not dispute the
                    scaffolding cost of $70,000, the total sum came to
                    $113,018.84 ($43,018.84 + $70,000) which was what the AR had
                    awarded. (The defendant only seemed to realise its mistake
                    at the hearing – that it should not have appealed
                    against this item).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Citiwall’s additional labour
                costs of $254,800.49</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Once again,
                    Anthony’s assessment of this item came in for heavy
                    criticism by the defendant. The defendant contended that
                    Anthony’s computation of this item was false as the
                    defendant’s computation (based on 15,459 sq m x $17)
                    came to $262,803.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff explained
                    that the figure $254,800.49 appeared in Citiwall’s
                    final accounts as “labour claim”. Hardcastle
                    had rejected this claim as he said it was a revision of the
                    contract rate for installation. Again, the plaintiff
                    attributed Hardcastle’s opinion to his lack of
                    diligence in reviewing the source documents and/or his
                    biasness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff pointed out
                    that the PO Works mentioned at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>(c)(i) above were not exhaustive of all
                    abortive installation works undertaken by Citiwall. Rather,
                    they were for works carried out in September 2004 whereas
                    Citiwall’s additional labour costs were for works on
                    the internal panels that stretched into 2005. As of March
                    2005, approximately 7,500 sq m of panels had been
                    dismantled, recoated and reinstalled which quantity exceeded
                    the figure mentioned at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>(c)(i) above. Citiwall could not be
                    expected to do all this work for free. Hardcastle had no
                    answer to this question and merely repeated his self-serving
                    contention that Citiwall’s additional labour costs
                    must relate solely to a revision of the contract rate for
                    installation from $17 per sq m to $23 per sq m even though
                    he did not see any documentary proof of acceptance of the
                    revised rate by Facade. Indeed, his purported reliance in
                    this regard on Citiwall’s written requests to Facade
                    dated 28 July 2004 and 20 September 2005 was
                    misconceived as he had not seen evidence that Facade
                    accepted Citiwall’s requests for change in
                    rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Unlike Hardcastle, Anthony
                    had undertaken a rigorous review of Citiwall’s
                    progress claims and cross-referenced them to his
                    verification of quantities of coated panels delivered to
                    site. Indeed, Anthony had arrived at the same figure
                    ($262,803) as the defendant, based on 15,459 sq m charged at
                    the contract rate of $17 per sq m. However, he reduced the
                    figure to $254,800.49 as a compromise and in so doing, he
                    had excluded the claims for installation of the contract
                    quantities to avoid double-counting for both the original
                    and new paints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff submitted
                    that Hardcastle’s report on quantum did not say he had
                    examined Citiwall’s progress claims as part of the due
                    diligence process to ascertain the basis of this claim. He
                    had merely hazarded a guess of the basis when he was unable
                    to identify the source. Lo, Facade’s general manager
                    had testified that extensive work had to be carried out
                    on-site due to the need to dismantle and reinstall panels as
                    a result of the paint issue. Consequently, it was correct of
                    the AR to allow this item of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Backcharges of $67,000 against
                Citiwall for labour costs and dismantling work not
                done</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The defendant complained
                    that this charge should have been credited to the defendant
                    as Anthony did in his first report. It was argued that
                    Anthony had not given a cogent explanation why the defendant
                    should bear this purported cost. Taisei had supplied workers
                    to Facade when there was insufficient manpower on site. The
                    sum of $67,000 was deducted from Facade’s account for
                    the labour supplied by Taisei. There was no reason for the
                    same claim to be made against the defendant as it amounted
                    to double-counting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff explained
                    that Facade’s back-charging of this sum in turn to
                    Citiwall was not disputed by the latter. The back-charge
                    included dismantling work not done. Anthony had assessed
                    there was about 4,000 sq m of excess panels that were not
                    dismantled and for which Citiwall did not make a claim. It
                    was also not disputed that Taisei required extra labour to
                    be deployed by Facade on site to expedite the subcontract
                    works. Indeed, Harker, the defendant’s expert on the
                    delay issue had relied on this fact. It was not unreasonable
                    of Facade to assist Citiwall (with its agreement) with extra
                    manpower for installation of the panels. There was no
                    double-counting involved as the defendant had assumed
                    (without basis) that this item was the exact same backcharge
                    for labour supplied by Taisei to Facade which it was not,
                    although the figure was identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(d)   Site preliminaries of
                $1,040,662.35</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The AR had allowed
                    $1,040,662.35 for additional site preliminaries incurred by
                    the plaintiff as part of the delay costs incurred for late
                    installation of panels. The defendant argued that the claim
                    for increased preliminaries should be of the actual
                    additional costs incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, the AR had
                    accepted the computation of Anthony (using a broad brush
                    approach) of an average running cost per day of $3,811.95 x
                    273 days. The cost allowed included staff costs,
                    administrative and general expenses, financing charges,
                    depreciation, selling and travelling expenses. Anthony had
                    taken the preliminaries claimed of $2,794,157.66 for the
                    entire duration of the works, divided that by the actual
                    construction period multiplied by the number of days of
                    delay. The defendant argued that the claim should be of the
                    actual additional costs incurred (citing Stephen Furst,
                        <em>Keating on Construction
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        8<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) which the
                    plaintiff ought to have known and was capable of proving.
                    These would cover items like utilities, scaffolding, plant,
                    small tools and site supervision. Moreover, Anthony had
                    overlooked the fact that Facade had provided a budget of
                    $1,802,165.00 for preliminaries as against an actual sum of
                    $2,794,157.66. The defendant should therefore only be liable
                    for the difference of $991,992.66 ($2,794,157.66 -
                    $1,802,165.00).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant disagreed
                    with Anthony’s evaluation for other reasons. It
                    pointed out that Anthony had admitted that some items in his
                    computation were likely to have been incurred during the
                    original contract period rather than during the extended
                    period –
                    <em>ie</em>, he had used the dates when
                    the items were paid for regardless of when the work was
                    carried out. The defendant cited as an example the use of
                    the gondola. A sum of $53,802.52 was incurred for gondola
                    usage during the contract period as against $320,811.85 for
                    the extended period. Similarly, a sum of $52,326.36 was
                    incurred for the cost of general workers during the contract
                    period as opposed to $380,694.55 during the extended period.
                    The defendant added that Facade had contracted with Taisei
                    on the basis that it would not be claiming prolongation
                    costs in the event of delay. Consequently, Facade could not
                    look to the defendant to recoup prolongation costs as that
                    would be tantamount to re-writing the contract between
                    Facade and Taisei where the former had made a bad
                    bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Compact Malaysia’s site
                preliminaries of $207,603.00</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant pointed out
                    that Anthony had used a “weighted” approach
                    based on the square metre of coated materials for the
                    project and weighted that against the entire square metre
                    coating production every month for the coating factory for
                    all the other jobs for 2004 and 2005. Anthony had opined
                    that the defendant was liable for $173,409 (at $500 per day)
                    for 2004 and $34,194 for 2005 (at $278 per day x 123 days).
                    He proceeded on the basis that all coated panels in 2004
                    were rejected and therefore the work was abortive. For his
                    2005 assessment, Anthony had relied on Pickavance’s
                    opinion that the defendant was responsible for 123 days of
                    delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant pointed out
                    that Anthony’s computation failed to take into account
                    that Facade had applied to Taisei twice for extensions of
                    time (“EOT”) to complete the project for
                    reasons other than the paint issue; the first EOT
                    application was for 139 days followed by a second
                    application for 147.5 days. Lo had admitted in
                    cross-examination that Facade’s EOT applications were
                    still pending consideration by the architect. Consequently,
                    the defendant argued, even if there was no issue with the
                    paint, the project would still have been delayed for the
                    reasons set out in Facade’s EOT applications and
                    Facade would have incurred resultant prolongation
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendant alleged that
                    Anthony had confessed during cross-examination that the
                    subcontract between Compact Malaysia and Facade had
                    incorporated the cost of preliminaries in the unit rate of
                    $89 per sq m for coating the panels. Similarly Rotol’s
                    unit rate of $26 per sq m for recoating the panels included
                    the cost of preliminaries. Hence, the plaintiff was not
                    entitled to claim preliminaries from the defendant in any
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It was also argued that
                    there was also no evidence that Compact Malaysia had
                    incurred additional costs to cope with the paint issue. On
                    this basis alone, the defendant submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s claim should fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendant conceded
                    however that Hardcastle had recognised that the defendant
                    should be responsible for some productivity loss by Compact
                    Malaysia during the months July to August and November 2004
                    (in the sum of $46,826.60). There was also confusion on the
                    quantities of panels that Compact Malaysia had coated and/or
                    rectified. The parties did not dispute that internal panels
                    approximating 7,000 sq m were recoated by Rotol but there
                    were no records or invoices evidencing the works purportedly
                    carried out by Compact Malaysia except for 741.2 sq m
                    identified by Hardcastle in his AEIC. The plaintiff had
                    failed to explain why only some and not all invoices
                    evidencing the coating works had been
                produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiff on the other
                    hand contended that Anthony’s approach in his
                    computation was entirely reasonable and hence it was
                    accepted by the AR. The plaintiff pointed out that
                    Anthony’s average running cost per day of $3,811.95
                    was lower than Facade’s budgeted running cost of
                    $3,917.75 per day (based on its budgeted figure of
                    $1,802,165).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the alternative, if the
                    court accepted Hardcastle’s contention that there
                    ought to be specific classification of items of costs as he
                    alleged (despite not undertaking the exercise himself), one
                    should then take into account the actual additional
                    preliminaries incurred by Facade as against the budgeted sum
                    of $1,802,165. This would be $991,992.66 using the
                    defendant’s figure. The difference between the award
                    ($1,040,662.35) and $991,992.66 was not large – a sum
                    of $48,669.69.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, the plaintiff
                    contended, as Hardcastle did not verify from the source
                    documents the basis and/or accuracy of Anthony’s
                    assessment, he was in no position to challenge
                    Anthony’s figures. That being the case, the AR had to
                    accept Anthony’s and reject Hardcastle’s
                    assessment. The plaintiff contended that Hardcastle’s
                    sweeping challenge on approach was baseless. Hardcastle
                    himself had admitted during cross-examination that
                    Anthony’s weighted approach was a fair basis. Anthony
                    had only taken into account those portions of Compact
                    Malaysia’s preliminaries that could logically be
                    attributable to the project based on overall output.
                    Moreover, Anthony had only allowed preliminaries for the 273
                    days of delay the plaintiff would have to bear in completing
                    the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiff submitted it
                    was an irrelevant consideration whether Facade would have
                    been entitled to claim prolongation costs from Taisei. There
                    was no breach on the part of Taisei. Similarly, the fact
                    that Facade may have entered into a bad bargain was also
                    irrelevant. The plaintiff confirmed that no EOT had been
                    granted to-date to the plaintiff notwithstanding that Taisei
                    may have been granted EOT by the employer. It was the
                    plaintiff’s case based on Pickavance’s evidence
                    (which the AR accepted) that it was the defendant’s
                    breaches which had caused critical delay to
                    completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiff agreed that
                    Facade’s rate of $89 per sq m for fabricating and
                    coating the panels may have included the cost of
                    preliminaries but this was not the case for Rotol’s
                    rate of $26 per sq m for recoating. It pointed out that
                    essentially all the coating works carried out in 2004 were
                    abortive since an acceptable new paint was only applied from
                    January 2005 onwards. Consequently, the time taken for the
                    abortive works could have been utilised for other projects
                    for profit where the cost of preliminaries incurred could
                    have been recovered. As a result of the abortive works,
                    Compact Malaysia was effectively deprived of recovering the
                    cost of preliminaries for the project in 2004. Accordingly,
                    the defendant ought to bear the costs
                mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff explained
                    that the delay of 123 days determined by Pickavance was due
                    to the switch from double-sided to single-sided spraying of
                    the panels. This resulted in a longer time being required
                    for the coating works which again deprived Compact Malaysia
                    of recovering the cost of preliminaries from such prolonged
                    disruption period when the same could have been recovered by
                    Compact Malaysia undertaking other projects. The AR had
                    accepted the evidence on single-sided spraying. The
                    defendant should therefore bear the cost of delay arising
                    therefrom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff noted that
                    Hardcastle had allowed for loss of productivity in the sum
                    of $43,826.60. In making his assessment, Hardcastle had
                    adopted the same weighted approach as Anthony and had relied
                    on the actual costs Anthony used in his assessment. The
                    plaintiff submitted that this must mean that Hardcastle had
                    endorsed Anthony’s approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiff submitted
                    that accepting Anthony’s approach did not amount to
                    double counting/recovery. Anthony had not included any cost
                    of preliminaries after the new paint was accepted in 2005
                    and applied to panels, as the cost of preliminaries would
                    then be recovered from Facade in fabrication and coating
                    works. Consequently, no deductions needed to be made as
                    contended by Hardcastle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Compact Malaysia’s overtime costs
                of $108,415.00</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendant contended
                    that the claim for overtime would overlap with the
                    plaintiff’s claim for rectification costs. It noted
                    that although Compact Malaysia did not fabricate or coat any
                    panels in July and August 2004, the plaintiff had paid
                    overtime costs of RM35,110 and RM28,868 respectively and
                    sought to recover those costs from the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The plaintiff explained
                    that the overtime charges were again computed by Anthony
                    using the weighted approach and based on actual overtime
                    payments (even though according to the testimony of Ling,
                    the time and effort taken up by the paint issue would appear
                    to indicate Anthony’s assessment was lower than actual
                    time spent). Consequently, Anthony’s assessment which
                    was fair and reasonable was accepted by the AR for the award
                    of $108,415.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff gave the
                    following breakdown for the overtime figure:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_2004"></a>2004:     $83,189.00</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_2005"></a>2005:     $25,266.00</p>
<p class="Judg-2">$108,415.00</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the
                    defendant’s complaint that overtime was charged when
                    no fabrication and coating works seemed to have been done in
                    July and August 2004, the plaintiff explained that Anthony
                    had used the labour claims presented by the subcontractor
                    Shuang Lee for fabrication works while he computed coating
                    charges based on delivery notes to site. Panels continued to
                    be delivered to site in July and August 2004 for
                    installation even if fabrication stopped on account of the
                    paint problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The plaintiff submitted
                    that Hardcastle’s comments should be disregarded since
                    he had admitted that he was unaware that there was
                    supporting documentation provided by the plaintiff.
                    Hardcastle clearly did not verify Anthony’s figures or
                    the quantum, his excuse being Harker had found that the
                    defendant was not in critical delay and hence verification
                    by him was not necessary. Hardcastle then contradicted
                    himself by saying that if verification was required, he
                    would need more information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Taisei’s backcharges for labour
                supplied of $227,625.58</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant pointed out
                    this award was reduced from the plaintiff’s original
                    claim of $352,015.30. It sought to rely on paragraph 5.2.3.6
                    in Anthony’s first report dated 15 February 2008
                    (“Anthony First Report”) (where Anthony had
                    admitted he could not independently verify and determine the
                    claims) to point out that Anthony had relied on: (i)
                    Lo’s evidence; (ii) the records of Taisei on
                    backcharges attributable to the defendant; and (iii)
                    Taisei’s files for this claim. The defendant then
                    highlighted that in cross-examination Lo had admitted that
                    Taisei’s backcharge records did not describe the work
                    done. The claims also did not sit well with Citiwall’s
                    claim for additional labour of $254,800.49 and acceleration
                    claim of $93,000 and were, according to the defendant,
                    duplicitous. Hardcastle had observed that Taisei had
                    complained on three occasions about the lack of manpower on
                    site and had supplied manpower to do Citiwall’s
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The plaintiff justified
                    the claim on the basis that the additional manpower that
                    Taisei insisted Facade provide was to accelerate the
                    sub-contract works that had been substantially delayed due
                    to the paint problem. This was evidenced by the
                    correspondence from Taisei in the months prior to the actual
                    date of completion even though Citiwall had deployed more
                    manpower than contractually contemplated. The plaintiff
                    explained that it did not charge to the defendant
                    backcharges imposed by Taisei prior to the discovery of the
                    paint problem or, after 13 July 2005, which was the
                    date of practical completion. Hence, a deduction of
                    $124,389.72 from the plaintiff’s original claim of
                    $352,015.30. It added that the bulk of the back charges were
                    for the critical period April to July 2005 when Facade and
                    Citiwall were trying to expedite the installation works on
                    site as required by Taisei. The plaintiff pointed out that
                    in 2005, apart from the cladding works, Facade did not
                    undertake any other major works for the project.
                    Consequently, an adverse impact on the coating process would
                    have a similar effect on the cladding works and in turn, on
                    completion of the project. Accordingly, the AR was correct
                    to award this claim to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff added there
                    was no double-counting as alleged by the defendant because
                    Anthony’s assessment of the claims for additional
                    labour and acceleration cost of Citiwall related to costs
                    directly incurred by Citiwall for its scope of work.
                    Taisei’s backcharges on the other hand were for
                    additional labour provided by Taisei to Facade to expedite
                    the subcontract works. Since Hardcastle did not even review
                    Citiwall’s progress claims, he was in no position to
                    state that Taisei’s backcharges related to workers
                    supplied to do Citiwall’s work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(f)   Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Notwithstanding that the
                    normal rule is that costs follow the event, the defendant
                    sought to persuade the court that the AR’s award of
                    costs in favour of the plaintiff should be set aside for the
                    following reasons:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff
                        did not succeed on all its claims including those for
                        (i) liquidated damages; (ii) Citiwall’s
                        acceleration costs; (iii) some of Taisei’s
                        back charges; (iv) Facade’s claim for
                        overheads of its head office; (v) the
                        plaintiff’s claim for overheads of its head
                        office; and (vi) the plaintiff’s purported
                        loss of goodwill;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     In terms of quantum, the
                        plaintiff’s original claim was for $6,862,439.80
                        (which included liquidated damages of $2,184,000). The
                        figure was revised to $6,565,544.16 at the submission
                        stage while the AR only awarded
                    $2,842,102.08;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendant’s experts and
                        lawyers spent considerable time dealing with the
                        plaintiff’s unsuccessful issues which should not
                        have been put forth in the first place; and Anthony had
                        to revise his opinions and figures several times during
                        the assessment proceedings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendant’s
                        experts, Hardcastle and Harker, had criticised the
                        amount of duplication in the appendices attached to the
                        reports of Anthony and Pickavance; and Harker had to
                        discard ten arch lever files as unnecessary
                        duplication;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     The assessment proceeded on the basis
                        no EOTs were granted but this premise was untrue, based
                        on the late discovery of the letter dated
                        30 November 2007 from RSP to Taisei (“the
                        RSP letter”). In that letter, Taisei was granted
                        168 days EOT by RSP from 13 October 2004 to
                        30 March 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendant submitted
                    that had the AR known of the RSP letter, she may well have
                    made a different costs order. The defendant sought costs
                    against the plaintiff for the assessment hearing as well as
                    of the two appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The plaintiff argued that
                    as a general rule, costs should follow the event (citing the
                    Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta v Maoro
                        Andrea G</em> [1994] SLR(R) 501
                        (“<em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta v Maoro Andrea G</em>”)
                    and that of the UK appellate court <em>In Re
                        Elgindata Ltd </em><em>(No 2)</em> [1992] 1 WLR 1207).
                    The general rule would not cease to apply simply because the
                    successful party raised issues or allegations that failed.
                    However, the successful party could be deprived of his costs
                    or part thereof where he raised issues or made allegations
                    improperly or unreasonably. Here, the plaintiff had a valid
                    basis for the various heads of claim put forward and its
                    experts were of the same view. The plaintiff’s failure
                    on some of its claims was primarily due to its inability to
                    discharge the burden to prove that those losses were
                    actually incurred and attributable to the paint problem.
                    That did not mean that the unsuccessful claims were either
                    frivolous or vexatious in any way or that the plaintiff
                    acted improperly or unreasonably and indeed, the AR did not
                    so find.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In regard to its claim for
                    liquidated damages, the plaintiff had always maintained that
                    it would be based on the actual quantum of liquidated
                    damages it incurred. Until that could be ascertained, the
                    plaintiff was left to seek the full potential sum on an
                    indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff pointed out
                    that the bulk of the experts’ evidence pertained to
                    quantum of rectification costs on which the plaintiff fully
                    succeeded. The plaintiff had also succeeded on the issue of
                    delay as the AR accepted Pickavance’s findings in this
                    regard. Consequently, it could not be said that the
                    plaintiff had not succeeded substantially on its claim as
                    not to be entitled to full costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It was also pointed out
                    that the AR had opined (in her second grounds of decision,
                    see below at <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>) that
                    this was not a “run of the mill assessment of damages
                    hearing”, the implication being that the
                    plaintiff’s conduct did not contribute to the
                    proceedings being protracted in anyway. In conclusion, the
                    plaintiff submitted that costs ought not to be awarded by
                    carrying out a mathematical apportionment of the sum awarded
                    against the sum claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As for the
                    defendant’s complaint of duplication, the plaintiff
                    contended this was a bare assertion and the defendant had
                    not furnished any evidence in support. The plaintiff was not
                    aware of any duplication. While the plaintiff’s
                    evidence was indeed voluminous, it had a duty to give
                    discovery within certain timelines and had handed to the
                    defendant all the documents that were reviewed by the
                    plaintiff’s experts. The defendant discarded the
                    plaintiff’s documents at its peril as was evidenced in
                    Hardcastle’s lack of due diligence found by the
                    AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Before I move on to
                    address the plaintiff’s appeal, I should point out
                    that the same was adjourned when it first came on for
                    hearing (together with the defendant’s appeal). The
                    adjournment was necessitated by the plaintiff’s
                    application in Summons No 1461 of 2010 (“the
                    plaintiff’s application”) which I heard and
                    granted in August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The plaintiff’s
                    application was for leave to adduce further evidence for the
                    plaintiff’s appeal on the issue of liquidated damages
                    imposed by Taisei on the plaintiff. In the affidavit filed
                    in support thereof by its counsel, Mr Por, he pointed out
                    that although the AR accepted that the defendant was liable
                    for 273 days of critical delay to the project, she had
                    disallowed the plaintiff’s claim to recover from the
                    defendant liquidated damages deducted by Taisei from the
                    plaintiff’s final account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Mr Por deposed that prior
                    to the commencement of the assessment hearing, the quantum
                    of liquidated damages to be recovered by Taisei from the
                    plaintiff had not yet crystallised even though Taisei had
                    clearly indicated that it would be imposing liquidated
                    damages on the plaintiff once the quantum had been agreed
                    with the employer. Mr Por referred to his
                    client’s exchange of correspondence with Taisei
                    commencing in August 2008. Although the assessment hearing
                    concluded on 12 December 2008, the last set of
                    submissions was only filed on 20 May 2009 and the AR
                    delivered her second grounds of decision on 27 January
                    2010. The plaintiff received Taisei’s Statement of
                    Final Account dated 23 July 2009
                    (“Taisei’s Statement of Final Account”)
                    on 24 July 2009 stating that delay was for 105 days
                    amounting to $840,000. The plaintiff accepted the figure and
                    paid the sum; it was significantly less than the 273 days of
                    critical delay that the AR had found the defendant was
                    liable for. On 24 July 2009, Mr Por wrote to
                    inform the AR of Taisei’s Statement of Final Account
                    and sought leave to adduce the said evidence so that the
                    court could take the same into consideration when deciding
                    the quantum of liquidated damages. The defendant’s
                    solicitors by its letter dated 11 September 2009
                    objected to the admission of the said
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In her first grounds of
                    decision on 19 January 2010, the AR did not make a
                    specific order on Taisei’s Statement of Final Account
                    but disallowed the plaintiff’s claim for the
                    liquidated damages of $840,000 it had paid to Taisei on the
                    basis that no liquidated damages had been imposed on the
                    plaintiff as at the time of the assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The plaintiff pointed out
                    that the said additional evidence on the issue of liquidated
                    damages was not available during the assessment hearing as
                    Taisei’s Statement of Final Account was issued seven
                    months after the trial on liability concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Counsel for the defendant
                        <em>inter alia</em> argued that as
                    the AR had not awarded liquidated damages to the plaintiff,
                    it would not be appropriate for such a claim to morph into
                    one for an indemnity against future liquidated damages that
                    may be imposed. He contended that the basis of the claim was
                    also speculative and too remote as, at the time of the
                    assessment, no EOT had been awarded by Taisei nor had
                    liquidated damages been imposed. The claim was not in the
                    nature of general damages. Even if liquidated damages were
                    imposed, it could not be ascertained if the cause was due to
                    delay occasioned by the paint problem. Anthony had conceded
                    that he would have to see the reasons and breakdown of the
                    events giving rise to the delay before he could express an
                    opinion on the liquidated damages imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendant claimed that
                    it had established during the assessment hearing that the
                    sole reason for Taisei’s withholding monies from
                    Facade was due to Taisei’s exercising its right to
                    recover the loan (principal sum and interest) it extended to
                    Facade under the financing arrangement made between them. It
                    added that Anthony himself had reasoned that liquidated
                    damages should not be backcharged to the defendant. (Anthony
                    had set aside $2,184,000 for any liquidated damages imposed
                    by Taisei).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiff countered
                    that those extracts from the transcripts should not be taken
                    out of context. It was not in dispute that as at the
                    assessment stage, neither Mr Por nor the plaintiff’s
                    representatives or their experts including Anthony were
                    aware of the position <em>vis-a-vis</em> liquidated damages as neither
                    Taisei nor RSP had kept them updated on the situation.
                    Consequently, Anthony could only provide an estimate of the
                    liquidated damages that may be imposed on the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The defendant on its part
                    relied on Hardcastle’s report and referred to the
                    points he had raised that were relevant to the issue of
                    liquidated damages. These were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     Facade’s
                        applications to Taisei for EOTs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     Taisei’s
                        applications to RSP for EOTs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a>(c)     The final accounts
                        between Taisei and Facade; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_d"></a>(d)     Evidence that the
                        delay to the project was attributable to the defendant
                        and not to any other factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Hardcastle went on to
                    explain that the defendant should not be liable for
                    liquidated damages because:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     The contract
                        between the plaintiff and the defendant did not have a
                        liquidated damages clause;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     The subcontracts between
                        Facade and Compact similarly did not have a liquidated
                        damages clause;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     While the subcontract between Taisei
                        and Facade had a liquidated damages clause which
                        expressly stated it was not a penalty, it did not state
                        that it was a genuine pre-estimate of damages. The
                        liquidated damages were fixed at $8,000 per day even
                        though the MAS Building was occupied during the duration
                        of the works;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_d"></a>(d)     The scale of the liquidated damages
                        payable was not made known to the defendant until
                        25 December 2004, which was six months after the
                        paint tonality problem had arisen;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_e"></a>(e)     There was a duty on Facade to prosecute its case
                        for an EOT for the benefit of parties further down the
                        subcontract chain, who may suffer from liquidated
                        damages that may be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    defendant argued that on principle the plaintiff could not
                    in any event claim liquidated damages in addition to its
                    claim for general damages as that would amount to double
                    recovery for the same breach. As a paint supplier, the
                    defendant should not be worse off than the other
                    contractors/subcontractors such as Facade who had expressly
                    contracted on the basis of being liable for liquidated
                    damages, which contract the defendant was not privy to. The
                    first time the defendant was aware of the existence of
                    liquidated damages in the project was when Taisei wrote to
                    the defendant on 25 December 2004. Even then, there was
                    only a fleeting mention of the potential exposure of $2m.
                    Further, liquidated damages would be too remote in this case
                    as the same was plainly unforeseeable by the defendant. Lo
                    had testified that there was usually no liquidated damages
                    clause in a paint applicator’s contract as such work
                    was “so straightforward”. However, I should
                    point out that Lo’s remark applies to ordinary and/or
                    standard but not customised paints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Notwithstanding the
                    objections raised by counsel for the defendant, I granted
                    the plaintiff’s application and allowed the plaintiff
                    to adduce additional evidence on the issue of liquidated
                    damages in relation to:-</p>

                        Certificate No. 25; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_g"></a>(g)     Bank notification to Taisei
                        dated 21 August 2009 confirming payment by MAS to

                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I further directed the AR
                    to determine the following issues:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
                        liquidated damages of $840,000 imposed by MAS on Taisei
                        were related to the defective paint <em>viz</em> the paint tonality for the external
                        aluminium cladding panels (“Further Issue
                        1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     Why Taisei did not grant any EOT to
                        Facade when it had been granted 168 days EOT in the RSP
                        letter and why Taisei did not disclose the EOT it
                        received in its letter dated 23 July 2009 to Façade
                        (“Further Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     On 11 April 2011, at
                    its behest, I granted the following additional orders to the
                    plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a>(a)     RSP was to
                        furnish a breakdown by affidavit of the liquidated
                        damages of $840,000 imposed on Taisei as well as a
                        breakdown of the 168 days EOT it granted to Taisei;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_b"></a>(b)     Taisei was to clarify on affidavit
                        the questions raised in Further Issues 1 and
                    2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In compliance with the
                    above directions, an associate director of RSP who was the
                    project’s director, one Chionh Teow Hwee
                    (“Chionh”), filed an affidavit on
                    26 April 2011. Chionh deposed the contractual
                    completion date of the project was 13 October 2004 and
                    the project was substantially completed on 13 July
                    2005. As Taisei had been granted EOT of 168 days up to
                    30 March 2005, the actual delay amounted to 105 days
                    for which liquidated damages were charged at $8,000 per day
                    or $840,000 for 105 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     On its part, the
                    architectural manager Subramaniayer Narayanan
                    (‘Narayanan”) of Taisei affirmed an affidavit
                    on 28 April 2011. Narayanan deposed Taisei did not know
                    whether the liquidated damages of $840,000 imposed by the
                    employer were strictly related to the defective paint, as
                    neither the employer nor RSP provided a breakdown of that
                    figure. Neither did Taisei receive a breakdown of the EOT of
                    168 days it was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Narayanan deposed that
                    Taisei did not grant any EOT to Facade or disclose to Facade
                    that it received EOT of 168 days in the RSP letter because
                    of Facade’s delay in the cladding works. Taisei had
                    also written to RSP who replied on 31 January 2011
                    confirming that none of the 168 days of EOT granted for the
                    project related to the delay due to the cladding tonality
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Based on the two
                    abovementioned affidavits, another hearing took place before
                    the AR on 8 July 2011. After considering the two
                    affidavits, the AR accepted the plaintiff’s argument
                    that although there was no contractual provision governing
                    the imposition of liquidated damages by the plaintiff on the
                    defendant, the plaintiff could be compensated for such loss
                    by way of general damages if it was a foreseeable loss
                    flowing from the defendant’s breach (applying
                        <em>Hadley v
                    Baxendale</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     However, although the
                    defendant must have known of the paint tonality problem, the
                    AR did not think that the defendant could have reasonably
                    foreseen that the employer would impose liquidated damages
                    on the main contractor, the extent to which such liquidated
                    damages would be imposed and that it would ultimately be
                    passed down to Facade and then to the plaintiff. She opined
                    that the facts in this case were too remote to support a
                    claim for general damages. She noted that Taisei’s
                    request for EOT included the paint tonality problem as one
                    of the delaying events. The AR reiterated that it would have
                    been inappropriate for her to deal with the issues of EOT
                    and liquidated damages at the assessment hearing as these
                    issues had not yet crystallised on 8 July
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Consequently, the AR
                    answered Further Issue 1 in the negative (given she had
                    insufficient evidence to find otherwise) and on Further
                    Issue 2, she made no finding given that Taisei had filed an
                    affidavit stating that it did not feel obliged to pass onto
                    Facade any EOT that it received from RSP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I disagreed with the
                    AR’s views. Consequently, I allowed the
                    plaintiff’s appeal, for reasons which are set out at
                        <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a> to <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     At the hearing, I had
                    commented to counsel for the defendant, Mr Narayanan, that
                    while he continuously criticised Pickavance’s (and
                    more so Anthony’s) evidence in his submissions and
                    argued that the testimonies of the defendant’s experts
                    (Hardcastle and Harker) were to be preferred, that was
                        <em>not</em> the view formed by the
                    AR who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses
                    unlike this court. Indeed, Mr Narayanan’s
                    submissions appeared to have completely disregarded the
                    AR’s assessment of the experts’
                    testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It would be appropriate at
                    this juncture to turn to the AR’s grounds of decision
                    and refer to relevant extracts therefrom of her
                    findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     At pages 4 and 5 of her
                    findings in her first grounds of decision (dated
                    19 January 2010), the AR had so observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Delay,
                            Disruption and
                        Prolongation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think it reasonable on any account to suggest
                        that the paint problem did not cause any critical delay
                        in the completion of the project. By all accounts, the
                        paint problem caused great difficulty and delay in the
                        progress of the MAS project, for which the Defendant
                        must be liable to some degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On this area, the Plaintiff and Defendant called their
                        respective experts to testify on the delay caused by the
                        paint problem to the completion of the project. I accept
                        that Mr Pickavance is a leading light in this field and
                        that his methods, particularly the use of time impact
                        analysis, are sound, logical and generally accepted in
                        the construction industry. I do not think it is a
                        tenable position for the Defendant’s expert Mr
                        Harker to maintain that the paint problem caused
                        absolutely no delay to the project at all, such that no
                        damages under this head should be payable to the
                        Plaintiff. To my mind, this is clearly untenable and
                        unrealistic position to take, in light of all the
                        evidence led at the assessment hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the assessment hearing itself, I note that Mr
                        Pickavance was able to defend his methodology and
                        findings, and came across as a fair and reasonable
                        witness. He did not seek to embellish his testimony in
                        favour of the Plaintiff, and his methods stood up to
                        cross-examination. On the other hand, Mr Harker seemed
                        to stand rigidly by his own unique method of analysis,
                        which afforded no room for any sort of delay and deemed
                        every event in the programme to be a critical one. It
                        was evident to me that the completion of the project was
                        delayed by a substantial period. According to Mr Harker,
                        however, none of this delay was attributable to the
                        paint problem. If every event under his programme was a
                        critical one, surely then¸ this would have caused some
                        days of delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This analysis to my mind, defies logic and appears to
                        be unduly inflexible. This also meant that it was also
                        of little use in ascertaining the impact of the paint
                        problem on the progress of the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Mr Por added that the AR
                    had found Harker’s approach to mean that <em>any</em> delay in works meant a delay in
                    completion; this being in contrast to Pickavance’s
                    approach where “delay” was defined as that
                    which <em>resulted</em> in a delay in
                    completion. Consequently, if the AR had valid reasons for
                    rejecting Harker’s testimony (on which I heard no
                    submissions to the contrary from the defendant) this court
                    would have no basis to prefer the evidence of Harker over
                    that of Pickavance, as the defendant sought to argue. The
                    defendant’s submissions which were premised on the
                    acceptance of Harker’s testimony were thus flawed.
                    Similarly, if Hardcastle had relied on Harker’s
                    testimony (see above at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>) for his own report, then
                    Hardcastle’s evidence was equally
                flawed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It was also clear from her
                    first grounds of decision (dated 19 January 2010) that
                    the AR had accepted Anthony’s testimony even though
                    she did not expressly reject Hardcastle’s evidence.
                    Indeed, the AR affirmed her acceptance of Anthony’s
                    expertise on paint coverage at page 5 of her second grounds
                    of decision (dated 27 January 2010) in relation to the
                    defendant’s counterclaim. If the quantum of the
                    defendant’s counterclaim allowed by the AR was also
                    based on Anthony’s assessment (on which there was no
                    appeal by either party), it did not lie in the
                    defendant’s mouth to criticise Anthony’s
                    assessment of the plaintiff’s claim – the
                    defendant could not “blow hot and cold”
                    simultaneously to suit its purpose. Consequently, this court
                    could not fault the findings and awards made by the court
                    below which were based on Anthony’s
                    assessments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It bears noting that
                    although Hardcastle criticised Anthony’s approach, he
                    did not offer an alternative method of quantification for
                    the plaintiff’s claims, given his excuse that he did
                    not have adequate information. When pressed by counsel for
                    the plaintiff, Hardcastle said he did not ask for additional
                    evidence or information to enable him to undertake his own
                    quantification. The omission, to say the least, did not
                    reflect well on Hardcastle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     There were other aspects
                    of Hardcastle’s cross-examination that justifiably
                    prompted the AR not to accept his testimony. I refer in
                    particular to the statement of final accounts between Facade
                    and the plaintiff (“Facade’s statement of final
                    accounts”) which was as follows:-</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Hardcastle had testified
                    that dismantling and reinstallation works came under Section
                    B – items 2, 4a and 4b of Façade’s statement of
                    final accounts. Indeed, his entire findings were based on
                    this document while counsel for the defendant agreed that
                    the plaintiff was entitled to $113,000. It is to be noted
                    from Facade’s statement of final accounts that no
                    rates or quotations were given for the three items. The
                    rates were to be found in the evaluation certificate of
                    Facade (“Exhibit P-10”) tendered in court
                    below. It was noted from Exhibit P-10 that Hardcastle had
                    accepted that the plaintiff dismantled and reinstalled 400
                    sq m of panels but it was at the plaintiff’s contract
                    rate of $17 per sq m and not at $21 or $23 as Hardcastle
                    contended. Moreover, Exhibit P-10 did not state (as
                    Hardcastle asserted) that the plaintiff’s claim for
                    labour of $254,800.49 must be at a rate higher than $17 per
                    sq m; Hardcastle had no evidence to support his opinion.
                    Exhibit P-10 states:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Another aspect of
                    Hardcastle’s testimony that was unsatisfactory was his
                    contention that the plaintiff had no evidence to
                    substantiate its overtime claim. Counsel for the plaintiff
                    had pointed out to Hardcastle at the assessment hearing that
                    such evidence was disclosed in discovery in relation to
                    Anthony’s report. Hardcastle then admitted he had not
                    considered such substantiation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Further, Hardcastle had,
                    at para 4.4 of his report dated 18 July 2008
                    (Hardcastle’s Report”) alleged that the
                    plaintiff provided him with documents on the paints ordered,
                    delivered and invoiced which were insufficient for his
                    evaluation. He stated he was largely reliant on:
                    (i) information contained in Anthony’s First
                    Report which was “generally unsupported evidentially;
                    and (ii) information provided by the plaintiff which
                    “in itself was of limited utility”. He added
                    that none of the cost calculations in Anthony’s First
                    Report were founded on any evidenced quantities or actual
                    cost information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In my opinion such
                    sweeping (and unwarranted) criticism of Anthony’s
                    assessment/reports begs the question – if indeed
                    Hardcastle thought Anthony’s information was so
                    unreliable, why did he not go to the source/primary
                    documents himself to verify the accuracy of Anthony’s
                    information? As I understood it from counsel for the
                    plaintiff, all the documents relied on by Anthony were
                    discovered or discoverable to the defendant. In this regard,
                    I note that Anthony’s First Report totalled 705 pages;
                    excluding Appendices F to H. Anthony had further prepared a
                    second report dated 22 August 2008
                    (“Anthony’s Second Report”) in response
                    to Hardcastle’s Report. It was clear from
                    Anthony’s two reports (and the corrections dated
                    19 September 2008 made to his first report) that unlike
                    Hardcastle, Anthony had taken great care in reviewing all
                    the necessary and voluminous documents involved before
                    arriving at his assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     At para 1.6 of his report,
                    Hardcastle had opined that Appendices F, G and H in
                    Anthony’s First Report were either irrelevant or, that
                    their relevance was unclear to him. Yet, Hardcastle’s
                    Report had, in assessing the plaintiff’s labour
                    charges and acceleration costs (at paras 10.17 to 10.24)
                    referred to the information in Appendix G. Moreover,
                    Appendix F contained financial documents and Appendix H
                    contained all the work orders of Facade which were used to
                    extract the number of panels that were found in delivery
                    orders. Hardcastle could not have identified the number of
                    coated panels had he not referred to Appendix H. Indeed,
                    Anthony pinpointed 50 items of data in Appendix G of
                        <em>Hardcastle’s Report</em>
                    that came from Appendix H of Anthony’s First
                    Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Some other shortcomings in
                    Hardcastle’s Report have been noted earlier at
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>, <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>. I would add that in para 6.8 of his
                    report, Hardcastle had again stated that he relied for his
                    calculations on Anthony’s information in respect of
                    preparing recoating works. He then analysed (with his
                    colleague Lee Armstrong) the invoices selected by Harker and
                    concluded that the total area of panels recoated by Compact
                    Malaysia (at $26 per sq.m) and Rotol (at $15.40 per sq.m)
                    were 741.20 sq.m and 6,952.10 sq m respectively. Hardcastle
                    testified that he adopted those quantities for the purpose
                    of his related evaluation, adding again that should further
                    relevant records become available, he would be happy to
                    undertake such review and analysis as the court may require.
                    In my opinion, Hardcastle’s repeated excuse was
                    unacceptable – he knew very well that he was the
                    defendant’s expert on quantum for the assessment
                    hearing. He could not expect the court to give him a second
                    bite of the cherry and allow him/the defendant to render
                    further reports for the court’s determination of the
                    amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, when all
                    the documents required for his evaluation were available to
                    him but not reviewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The shortcomings in
                    Hardcastle’s report were highlighted in
                    Anthony’s Second Report, some of which are set out in
                        <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> to <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> below. It would not be
                    possible or practical for this court to repeat
                    Anthony’s many criticisms of Hardcastle’s
                    Report. Suffice it to say Anthony’s criticisms were
                    well founded. Consequently, I was of the view that the AR
                    had valid reasons to prefer Anthony’s evidence to that
                    of Hardcastle. I should also point out that while Hardcastle
                    was a quantity surveyor, Anthony’s qualifications and
                    credentials were far more varied. Besides being a civil
                    engineer, Anthony holds two law degrees, has worked as a
                    contracts administrator as well as a construction and
                    project manager and more significantly, he has had
                    experience in cladding works. Unlike Anthony, Hardcastle had
                    never worked in Singapore and therefore had no knowledge of
                    the local cladding industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Hardcastle’s
                    review of the plaintiff’s documents was not only
                    selective and cursory but his comments in relation thereto
                    were occasionally misleading. Anthony noted that
                    Hardcastle’s statement in para 4.4 of his report (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a>) on
                    inadequate documentation failed to state that the alleged
                    “missing documents” or gaps in the
                    plaintiff’s documentation were not critical or crucial
                    to the formation of an expert opinion – they related
                    to progress reports and some minutes of
                meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    It was Anthony’s
                    view (with which this court agreed) that the thrust of an
                    expert’s report for the assessment hearing should
                    focus on three areas <em>viz</em>:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_a"></a>(a)     The process of
                        the coating system;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_b"></a>(b)     The overall impact of the
                        paint tonality issue to the project as a whole;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Singapore cladding
                        industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In his second report,
                    Anthony was mindful of the compensatory nature of the award
                    of damages and that parties should be put into the position
                    as if the contract had been properly performed. He referred
                    to <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> and
                    prepared his computation of the plaintiff’s damages on
                    that basis. As that was indeed the correct approach at law,
                    Hardcastle’s disagreement with Anthony’s
                    approach and method of assessment has very little merit. I
                    could not see how the Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>Hong Fok Realty</em> cited by
                    the defendant (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) advanced its case or reinforced
                    Hardcastle’s position that the excess labour charges
                    ($171,944.40) incurred by the plaintiff should not have been
                    allowed by the AR. That case did not detract from the
                    principles of recoverability spelled out in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Recovery of damages in Hadley v
                Baxendale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It would be appropriate
                    at this juncture to look at the law on recovery of damages
                    as set out in <em>Hadley v
                        Baxendale</em>. The two limbs of recovery in the
                    case are best summed up in Alderson B’s judgment (at
                    354-355):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where two parties have made a contract which one of
                        them has broken, the damages which the other party ought
                        to receive in respect of such breach of contract should
                        be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered
                        either arising naturally, i.e according to the usual
                        course of things, from such breach of contract itself,
                        or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in
                        the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made
                        the contract, as the probable result of the breach of
                        it. Now, if the special circumstances under which the
                        contract was actually made were communicated by the
                        plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both
                        parties, the damages resulting from the breach of such a
                        contract, which they would reasonably contemplate, would
                        be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow
                        from a breach of contract under these special
                        circumstances so known and communicated. But, on the
                        other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly
                        unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the
                        most, could be only be supposed to have had in his
                        contemplation the amount of injury which would arise
                        generally, and in the great multitude of cases not
                        affected by any special circumstances, from such a
                        breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The first limb of
                    recovery stipulates that normal losses that occur in the
                    usual course of events are recoverable without the need to
                    prove special knowledge on the part of the defaulting party;
                    this recovery would be for <em>general
                        damages</em>. For recovery under the second limb
                    in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> for
                    abnormal losses, it depends on whether the
                    exceptional/special circumstances were within the reasonable
                    contemplation of both parties at the time of the contract;
                    such recovery comes under <em>special
                        damages</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    All the items assessed
                    by Anthony and which formed the subject of the
                    defendant’s appeal were for general damages <em>ie</em>, direct losses under the first
                    limb in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>.
                    The plaintiff’s appeal on liquidated damages would be
                    consequential losses, <em>ie</em>,
                    special damages (and not general damages as counsel for the
                    defendant asserted) that came under the second limb in
                        <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>.
                    Consequently, the defendant’s argument (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> that the award
                    of liquidated damages would be tantamount to double recovery
                    of general damages to the plaintiff for the breach, is a
                    misconception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In summary, the
                    defendant’s appeal on the following items was
                    dismissed for the reasons stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_a"></a>(a)     Excess labour
                        charges of $171,944.40 (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> to <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). This head of claim
                        was for abortive labour costs incurred as a result of
                        the plaintiff or its subcontractors having to recoat
                        panels that were coated with the original paint and
                        which could not be accepted after they were installed.
                        Consequently, this claim was clearly within the
                        contemplation of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_b"></a>(b)     Recoating costs
                        of $590,614.42 charged by Compact Malaysia and Rotol
                        (see above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                        to <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). The AR
                        clearly explained why she had made the award at page 2
                        of her first grounds of decision. I adopted her
                        reasoning; in essence, the costs incurred were all
                        attributable to the problem with the original paint
                        supplied by the defendant. Consequently, those costs
                        should be borne by the defendant. As for the quantum,
                        the AR quite rightly accepted the plaintiff’s
                        argument that invoices and delivery orders would be a
                        reasonable source to derive the total area of panels
                        coated and delivered as it would be illogical for
                        unpainted panels to be delivered to
                    site.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_c"></a>(c)     Citiwall’s additional labour
                        costs of $254,800.49 (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> to <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>). This item appeared
                        in Facade’s statement of final accounts (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>) which
                        contained no rates. It had to be cross-referred to
                        Exhibit P-10 (see above at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>) for the rates. Hardcastle had
                        rejected the claim because he (wrongly) assumed (without
                        any supporting evidence) that Citiwall’s proposed
                        revised rate of $23 per sq m had been accepted and used
                        in the computation instead of the contract rate of $17
                        per sq m. Anthony on the other hand had cross-referenced
                        Citiwall’s progress claims with quantities of
                        coated panels delivered to site that he had verified. In
                        fact he had arrived at the same figure of $262,803 as
                        the defendant based on 15,459 sq m charged at $17 per sq
                        m – a figure he reduced to $254,800.49 as a
                        compromise. In so doing, Anthony excluded claims for
                        installation of contractual quantities of panels to
                        avoid double-counting of both the original and new
                        paints.</p>

                        Citiwall for labour costs (see above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> to <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>). There was no reason
                        for the defendant to be given the benefit of this item
                        as Facade incurred the expense of providing extra labour
                        that Citiwall failed to provide. Hardcastle mistakenly
                        assumed that it was for the same labour that Taisei
                        provided to Facade and then backcharged to the
                        latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_e"></a>(e)     Additional site preliminaries claim
                        (see above at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>).
                        Hardcastle had agreed during cross-examination that
                        Compact Malaysia was entitled to recover preliminaries
                        costs when the production line was not in use due to
                        paint trials. Hardcastle had assessed the preliminaries
                        for Compact Malaysia at $46,000 by adopting the same
                        weighted approach of Anthony, because he offered no
                        alternatives to the court. Anthony had used actual
                        overheads which were in fact lower than if he had
                        adopted the <em>Emden</em> or
                            <em>Hudson</em> formulae
                        recommended in the textbooks.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_f"></a>(f)     Compact

                        at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> to <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>). Anthony had
                        calculated the claim based on actual overtime charges of
                        the company. The defendant could not challenge the
                        figures as Hardcastle was not even aware the figures
                        were available for his verification until it was pointed
                        out to him although he agreed that in principle the
                        plaintiff was entitled to make such a
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_g"></a>(g)     Taisei’s backcharges of
                        $227,625.58 (see above at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> to <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>). The plaintiff had conceded before
                        the AR that Taisei’s total backcharges of $350,000
                        were not attributable to the defendant, hence the
                        reduction by $122,374.42 to $227,625.58. $227,625.58 was
                        for additional labour from April to July 2005 when
                        Taisei was rushing to complete the project. Taisei had
                        insisted on Facade providing additional labour and
                        provided it when Facade failed to do so. The fact that
                        Pickavance found there were 62 days of acceleration
                        proved that the increased manpower contributed to
                        earlier completion of the project and avoided the
                        penalty of more liquidated damages being imposed by
                        Taisei on the plaintiff and in turn on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The <em>Hudson</em> formula (see Stephen Furst, <em>Keating on Construction Contracts</em> (

                    2012) at para 9-034) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a formula for calculating claims for loss of
                        overheads and profit taken together, although with
                        suitable data a similar formula could be devised for
                        either individually. It calculates the loss as the
                        contractor’s overhead and profit percentage based
                        on a fair annual average multiplied by the contract sum
                        and the period of delay and divided by the contract
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    
          <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering
                        Contracts</em> (Nicholas Dennys, Mark Raeside

                        12<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010) contains the
                    following useful passage (at para 6-075):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Site or job-related overheads include the
                        non-productive costs which a Contractor will view as a
                        necessary expenditure to carry out the works. These
                        costs will include such items as supervision and site
                        accommodation and will include elements of plant such as
                        craneage and transport. It is obvious that, if these
                        costs are time-related, any delay to the project will be
                        likely to increase the cost to the Contractor of
                        undertaking the work and should be reimbursed to the
                        extent that the Employer has caused the overall delay to
                        the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Based on the extracts from the authoritative
                    textbooks, the AR was entitled to award damages for
                    additional preliminaries incurred by the plaintiff. I was
                    not satisfied that her reliance on Anthony’s weighted
                    approach was wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I now turn my attention
                    to the plaintiff’s appeal. In the light of the second
                    limb in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>,
                    the plaintiff must discharge the burden of proving that the
                    possibility of paying liquidated damages was within the
                    contemplation of the parties when the cladding contract was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    It cannot be disputed
                    that the spectre of liquidated damages is the bane of every
                    contractor in Singapore and is part and parcel of the
                    construction industry as a whole. Every contractor and
                    subcontractor in Singapore is not only conscious but fearful
                    of liquidated damages being imposed for late completion of a
                    project, regardless of the nature of their work. How then,
                    can it be said, as the defendant contended, that the
                    possibility of being liable for liquidated damages for the
                    project was not within the contemplation of the parties and
                    was too remote?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    To recapitulate, when
                    the assessment hearings began in September 2008, the quantum
                    of liquidated damages between Taisei and the plaintiff had
                    not yet crystallised. The correspondence between Taisei and
                    RSP (see above at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>)
                    all took place in 2009 well after the assessment hearing was
                    concluded (in December 2008). The first inkling the
                    plaintiff had of the imposition of liquidated damages on the
                    plaintiff by Taisei was by its receipt of Taisei’s
                    Statement of Final Account (dated 23 July 2009) showing
                    a deduction of $840,000 as liquidated damages for 105
                    days’ delay in the project. Counsel for the plaintiff
                    immediately informed the AR the following day of
                    Taisei’s statement of final account and sought leave
                    to adduce the said evidence. Unfortunately, the AR did not
                    respond to counsel’s request even though she did not
                    render her decision until January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Pursuant to this
                    court’s directions, the affidavits filed by RSP and
                    Taisei revealed that it was through no fault of the
                    plaintiff that the issue of liquidated damages was not make
                    known to the defendant earlier. In its letter dated
                    23 July 2009 forwarding Taisei’s Statement of
                    Final Account, Taisei had said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please note that in accordance with the Sub-Contract,
                        we impose you one hundred and five (105) days of
                        Liquidated Damages (LD) amount of S$840,000 for which a
                        rate of LD is stated in the Contract due to the
                        recoating problem caused by the tonality of paint colour
                        for the external aluminium cladding panels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The reference to the subcontract by Taisei was to
                    cl 9 of Taisei’s letter of award to Facade dated
                    11 July 2003 which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Liquidated
                            Damages</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event of delays due to your default, you are
                        required to reimburse us all losses, damages and expense
                        including Liquidated Damages incurred by us as a result
                        of your delays.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR had accepted that cl 9 allowed the
                    plaintiff to recover general damages but opined the claim
                    for liquidated damages was too remote; I disagree. It was
                    clearly stated in Taisei’s letter that the liquidated
                    damages imposed on the plaintiff resulted from the delay in
                    the cladding works and nothing else. Why would the defendant
                    not be liable to indemnify the plaintiff’s payment of
                    $840,000 to Taisei?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    There were other factors
                    that I took into account in allowing the plaintiff’s
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the
                        plaintiff’s solicitors had put the
                        defendant’s solicitors on notice on
                        24 October 2008 (<em>before</em> the second tranche of the
                        assessment hearing) that there was a likelihood of
                        liquidated ascertained damages of at least four months
                        being imposed on the plaintiff, due to Taisei’s
                        letter dated 10 October 2008 to Facade (which copy
                        was enclosed with the letter). There was no substantive
                        reply from the defendant’s solicitors to the
                        aforesaid letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, in accordance with my
                        direction to the AR (see above at <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>), Taisei inquired of
                        RSP who, by its letter dated 31 January 2011 to the
                        former, confirmed that the 168 days of EOT that it
                        granted for the project did not cover any delay due to
                        the cladding tonality issue. (In its application for
                        EOT, one of the reasons given by Taisei was
                        “delay in cladding installation works due to
                        inconsistent colour tonality of metal cladding
                        panels”, a reason RSP did not
                    accept).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, it was the finding of the AR
                        that the paint tonality problem caused a delay of 273
                        days with no concurrent causes of delay, based on
                        Pickavance’s expert testimony which she accepted
                        in preference to Harker’s evidence. Less the 168
                        days EOT granted by RSP to Taisei (see above at
                            <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>), the
                        actual delay was therefore 105 days attributable to the
                        paint problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, the defendant overlooked
                        the fact that the contract between Taisei and MAS has no
                        bearing on the contract between Taisei and the plaintiff
                        as reflected in the letter of award (see above at
                            <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a>.
                        Consequently, Taisei’s entitlement to EOT under
                        one ground in the main contract did not mean that the
                        subcontractor/Facade was or was not entitled to EOT on
                        another ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Granted, the claim by
                    the plaintiff to be reimbursed the liquidated damages it
                    paid to Taisei was not a contractual obligation of the
                    defendant. However, the important fact to note was that the
                    possibility of liquidated damages being imposed for the
                    delay in cladding works was very much a live issue between
                    the parties which the defendant, despite being forewarned by
                    counsel for the plaintiff, chose to ignore for its own
                    reasons. In a construction contract scenario, it cannot be
                    said that the defendant’s liability to compensate the
                    plaintiff for liquidated damages the latter would have to
                    pay to its main contractor (Taisei) could not have been
                    within the contemplation of the parties under the second
                    limb in <em>Hadley v
                    Baexendale.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    It is to be borne in
                    mind that a Registrar’s Appeal operates by way of an
                    actual rehearing before a judge in chambers. The judge
                    hearing the appeal is exercising confirmatory not appellate
                    jurisdiction (see <em>Lassiter Ann Masters v
                        To Keng Lam</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 392)
                        (“<em>Lassiter v To Keng
                        Lam</em>”). Consequently, the court’s
                    exercise of its discretion is unfettered. This court was
                    therefore entitled to relook the entire evidence tendered to
                    the court below, subject to the caveat that it would not be
                    able to assess the witnesses who testified before the AR and
                    make a finding on their veracity. Hence, there is usually
                    reluctance on the part of a judge dealing with
                    Registrar’s Appeals to depart from and disagree with
                    the findings of facts made by a court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Here, this court did not
                    depart from any factual findings made by the AR on the issue
                    of liquidated damages. The AR declined to make an award of
                    liquidated damages (even though she felt that it would come
                    within the purview of general damages) because she felt it
                    was too remote. As was pointed out (see above at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>), the second tranche of
                    the assessment had not even started when the defendant was
                    put on notice by the plaintiff of the possibility of
                    liquidated damages being imposed by Taisei and that the
                    plaintiff would look to the defendant in turn for an
                    indemnity against such payment. The AR was alerted by the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors to Taisei’s Statement of
                    Final Account dated 23 July 2009 showing a deduction of
                    $840,000 as liquidated damages for 105 days’ delay but
                    failed to respond or give directions on the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors’ request for further
                    evidence to be adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    This was not a situation
                    akin to <em>Lassiter v To Keng Lam</em>
                    where the appellant in a Registrar’s Appeal sought to
                    adduce further affidavits of evidence in chief at that stage
                    and the Court then had to decide on whether the principles
                    for such admission of new evidence as spelt out in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489
                        (“<em>Ladd v
                    Marshall</em>”) applied. Even if the principles
                    in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> applied in
                    this case, the plaintiff’s application would have been
                    allowed – it could not have been faulted for the
                    evidence it intended to adduce so late in the day, for the
                    reasons set out above at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>. At the very least, the plaintiff
                    should have been given an opportunity to address the court
                    below on the admissibility of the further evidence on
                    liquidated damages, notwithstanding the defendant’s
                    objections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Consequently, I allowed
                    the plaintiff’s appeal and directed that the defendant
                    should reimburse the plaintiff the sum of $840,000 paid to
                    Taisei as liquidated damages for 105 days of delay
                    occasioned by the tonality problem of the panels used in the
                    cladding works. At a further hearing (on 28 September
                    2011) to clarify the issue of interest, I awarded the
                    plaintiff interest on the said sum from 23 July 2009
                    (the date Taisei deducted the sum from Facade’s
                    statement of final account) until payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Section 12(1) of the
                    Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) empowers a court to
                    award interest on debts and damages “at such rate as
                    it thinks fit on the whole of the or any part of the debt or
                    damages for the whole or any part of the period between the
                    date when the cause of action arose and the date of the
                    judgment”. If this court was minded to award interest
                    to the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant had requested
                    that the period 26 August 2010 (when this court
                    remitted the matter back to the AR for further evidence to
                    be taken on the issue of liquidated damages) to
                    11 April 2011(when this court ordered Taisei and RSP to
                    file affidavits on the issue of liquidated damages) be
                    excluded because Taisei had given the defendant “the
                    run around”. When the court inquired of counsel for
                    the defendant, he agreed that it was not the fault of the
                    plaintiff that the defendant was given “the run
                    around” by Taisei. Consequently, there was no reason
                    for me to deprive the plaintiff of interest which had always
                    been part of the reliefs it prayed for. Even so, I did not
                    award interest from the date of the writ (17 June 2005)
                    but only from the day the plaintiff was actually out of
                    pocket by that substantial sum, which was more than 2 years
                    ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The general rule on
                    costs is that costs would follow the event. The plaintiff
                    was awarded substantial damages totalling $2,842,102.08
                    notwithstanding that it did not succeed in obtaining the
                    higher quantum that it sought or all the items of damages
                    that it claimed. In the light of the Court of Appeal’s
                    ruling in <em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta v Maoro Andrea G</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_62">[62]</a>) at [10], the
                    defendant’s submission that the plaintiff (and not the
                    defendant) should bear the costs of the assessment hearing
                    was not only misconceived but totally devoid of any
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In the result, I
                    dismissed the defendant’s appeal with costs and
                    allowed the plaintiff’s appeal with
                costs.</p>
