This is because his evidence is that he knew, from the appearance of those bundles after they had been unwrapped, that they were one-pound packets, which was confirmed after he weighed them (see [23] above).  Therefore, while Lee appears to take issue with the quantity of the transacted drugs, his defence is <span class="font-italic">not</span> about his knowledge of the quantity of transacted drugs, which is otherwise an issue going to the question of possession (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Hadi bin Haron v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 537 at [28]).  In fact, given Lee’s knowledge that the Three Bundles were each one-pound packets of heroin, there can be no dispute that Lee was in “knowing possession” of the entire quantity of heroin contained in the Three Bundles, given that he knew that he had physical possession, custody or control of those three <span class="font-italic">one-pound </span><span class="font-italic">packets</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) at [31], [34] and [40]).  Instead, Lee’s defence concerns what he intended to do with the excess quantity of drugs which he says had been mistakenly delivered, and specifically, that he intended that they be returned to Kelvin.  In other words, his defence is that he only intended to possess half the amount of diamorphine found in his possession for the purpose of trafficking because he intended that the excess amount be returned to Kelvin.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I should also add that there is no dispute that Lee knew that the Three Bundles contained heroin.  This follows from his evidence that the drugs which he had ordered from Kelvin, and which he had instructed Yap to collect at 28/30 Gul Avenue and deliver to the Room in the Hotel, consisted of heroin and cannabis (see [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Given that Lee does not dispute possession of or knowledge of the nature of the Three Bundles, I find that both these elements of the trafficking charge under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA have been <span class="font-italic">proven </span>as against Lee.  As such, the Prosecution can rely on (as they seek to) the presumption of trafficking in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1119 at [49]).   The only issue before the court in relation to the charge against Lee, therefore, is whether he has rebutted the presumption that he intended to traffic in not less than 24.21g of diamorphine.  Given Lee’s defence that he had been oversupplied by mistake amounts of heroin equivalent to that found in three half-pound packets, the question before the court is whether Lee has shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he only intended to traffic in not less than 12.105g of the amount of diamorphine in his possession at the time of his arrest.  This, in turn, depends on whether Lee can show that he intended to order only three half-pound packets of heroin from his supplier, but was instead supplied with three one-pound packets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for Yap, it is undisputed, and it is also his evidence at the trial that he had agreed to collect drugs from 28/30 Gul Avenue at Lee’s instructions and deliver them to Lee at the Room in the Hotel, and that the Three Bundles were part of these drugs (see [6] and [25] above).  There is therefore no question that Yap had “knowing possession” of the Three Bundles, in that Yap knew that he had physical possession, custody or control of “the thing that later turned out to be a drug” by virtue of him collecting those drugs from the unidentified male motorcyclist at 28/30 Gul Avenue (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [40]).  It is therefore unnecessary for the Prosecution to rely on the presumption of possession in s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, as it has otherwise done (see [18] above).  Since Yap is proven to have had the Three Bundles in his possession, he is presumed by s 18(2) of the MDA to have known the nature of what was contained in the Three Bundles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In his evidence, Yap claimed that he did not know that the Three Bundles which he had collected from 28/30 Gul Avenue actually contained heroin, until they were unwrapped in the Room (see [26] above).  However, a review of Yap’s closing submissions shows that he does not actually contend that he has successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew the nature of the drugs in the Three Bundles.  Instead, the main point raised by Yap in those submissions is that his role was confined to that of a courier in respect of the Three Bundles, which is a point that does not appear to be challenged by the Prosecution.  This is an issue that I will return to in the course of this judgment.  I turn first to consider the case against Lee.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Lee ordered half-pound packets of heroin </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Lee argues that he has rebutted the presumption under s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA that he intended to traffic in the Three Bundles that had been proven to be in his possession.  This is because of his evidence that he only ordered three half-pound packets of heroin, and not three one-pound packets.  The gist of his evidence in this regard is as follows.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lee’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Lee gave evidence that he had ordered from Kelvin one “buku” of “ganja”, which is a reference to cannabis.

Section 261(1) of the CPC allows the court to draw adverse inferences from the accused person’s failure to mention such material facts when he has been subject to this caution (see also <span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock</span>”) at [13]). Thus, while the accused person is not required to minutely detail his defence, a material fact relied on at trial must be stated in the cautioned statement or else it is less likely to be believed if it is raised at trial for the first time (see <span class="font-italic">Roshdi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1 at [21]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Lee’s claim that he had been oversupplied heroin by mistake was only raised for the first time in his Case for Defence (“the CFD”) filed on 14 June 2021.  In Lee’s cautioned statement, not only did Lee omit to mention this exculpatory claim, namely, that he had been oversupplied heroin by mistake, he <span class="font-italic">lied</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that Yap was his supplier of drugs and that the Three Bundles belonged to Yap (see [48] above).  Lee kept up with this lie in his investigation statements, which were recorded after his cautioned statement was taken.  Lee’s evidence is that he had lied in these statements to push all the blame to Yap (see [49] above).  The import of this is that Lee believed that the CNB did not yet know of his involvement in connection with the Three Bundles, and so he lied to distance himself from the Three Bundles.  Surely, these lies must have been told out of Lee’s realisation that, if he had told the truth to the CNB officers, that would link him to the charge relating to the Three Bundles (see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span><span class="font-italic"> Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 67 at [152]-[156]).  However, for present purposes, I put aside the issue of whether Lee’s lies are <span class="font-italic">corroborative </span>of other evidence of his guilt because the inquiry before the court is whether Lee has discharged his legal burden to rebut the presumption of trafficking in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>).  In other words, the court is assessing the sufficiency of Lee’s own evidence, not the evidence <span class="font-italic">against </span>Lee (in respect of which corroborative evidence would be relevant).  In that regard, it is established law that a lie that is not corroborative of guilt can still be relied upon by the court to make a finding that an accused person is not creditworthy, even if the accused person had a valid explanation for lying (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 at [62]).  In my judgment, Lee’s failure to mention his exculpatory claim when his cautioned statement came to be recorded, and the lie which he made in that statement and kept up with in his investigation statements, detrimentally affect his credibility and allows the court to draw an adverse inference that the version of events which he testified on is not the truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Putting that aside, another difficulty I find with Lee’s exculpatory claim about having been oversupplied heroin by mistake is his inability to maintain a consistent account of this claim.  In the CFD, Lee admitted at paragraph 2 that it was he who instructed Yap to collect drugs that he (Lee) had ordered from his Malaysian drug supplier, Kelvin.  At paragraph 5 of the CFD, it was stated that Lee “in fact ordered” from his Malaysian supplier “3 bundles of heroin of half-a-pound each and one packet of one kilogram of cannabis”.  Then at paragraph 7 of the CFD, it was stated that:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before [Lee] could ascertain that the quantity of drugs he had ordered were in fact delivered, CNB officers entered [the Room] and arrested both [Lee and Yap].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Paragraph 7 of the CFD was subsequently amended by way of Case for Defence (Amendment No 1) (“the ACFD”) filed on 6 July 2021.  The amended paragraph 7 read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Lee] weighed the bundles of heroin [referring to the Three Bundles] and discovered that they were not of the quantities he had ordered. He then telephoned [Kelvin] and thereon ascertained that he had been supplied with the wrong quantity of the drugs. [Kelvin] then informed [Lee] that he would arrange to take back the excess drugs at either Bendemeer or Kallang area, with exact place and time to be confirmed. Before [Lee] could confirm the time and place to return the excess drugs, CNB officers entered [the Room] and arrested both [Lee and Yap]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As would be clear, paragraph 7 of the ACFD was substantially different from paragraph 7 of the CFD.  In the CFD, Lee’s case was that, as far as the Three Bundles were concerned, he did not even have a chance to determine their weight before the CNB officers entered the Room, and thus the natural inference to be drawn is that he did not even know, at the time when he was arrested, that there had been an oversupply of heroin.  However, in paragraph 7 of the ACFD, Lee’s case is that he actually weighed the Three Bundles and <span class="font-italic">discovered</span> that they were in excess of the quantities that he had ordered from Kelvin, before the CNB officers entered the Room.  In other words, he knew, at the time when he was arrested, that there had been an oversupply of heroin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 When confronted with this inconsistency under cross-examination, Lee tried to explain that either his counsel had made a mistake when the CFD was prepared and filed, <span class="font-italic">or </span>he had made a mistake when giving instructions to his counsel in the preparation of the CFD.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 From my analysis of this part of the evidence, I was quite unconvinced by Lee’s explanation for the varying accounts in the CFD and the ACFD concerning whether he had weighed the Three Bundles before the CNB officers entered the Room and arrested him.  I am unable to understand how the facts of the case could have been more “fresh” in his mind at the time the ACFD came to be prepared, as compared to when the CFD was prepared.  As for Lee’s other explanation that he might have given incorrect instructions to his counsel, or that his counsel might have misheard his instructions, this has not been substantiated by any evidence other than Lee’s own assertion.  Since Lee had declined to waive privilege over the attendance notes prepared by his counsel when taking his instructions for the preparation of the CFD and the ACFD, there is no way for the court to ascertain whether there is any factual basis for his explanation that there might have been some mistake by either him or his counsel when the CFD was being prepared.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57  There is a further problem with the consistency of Lee’s account of being oversupplied with heroin.  In the ACFD, as I have highlighted earlier, Lee claimed that he had <span class="font-italic">discovered</span> that he had been given too much heroin <span class="font-italic">upon</span> <span class="font-italic">weighing the </span><span class="font-italic">Three Bundles in the Room </span>(see [53] above).  However, in his oral evidence, Lee stated more than once that, once the newspaper wrapping of the Three Bundles were removed, he knew straight away - in other words, even before any weighing of the Three Bundles took place - that he had been given more heroin than what he had ordered.  He recognised immediately that each of the Three Bundles were one-pound packets of heroin based on his “experience” (see [45] above).  As would be clear, this is again quite different from what was stated in the ACFD.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Lee’s shifting accounts about his exculpatory claim (from the time of the CFD, then the ACFD, and finally during his oral testimony) undermines his credibility as a witness.  In my view, Lee had provided the additional information in the ACFD and in his oral evidence - namely, that he had weighed the Three Bundles and phoned Kelvin, and that he also recognised upon sighting the Three Bundles unwrapped that they were one-pound packets of heroin - in order to make his defence about having been oversupplied with heroin appear more believable.  In my judgment, Lee’s shifting account, the fact that he had raised this exculpatory claim only late in the day, and the lie which he made in his cautioned statement and kept up with in his investigation statements, substantially affect the court’s assessment of the credibility of his evidence about having been oversupplied by Kelvin with heroin.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lee’s evidence that he had called Kelvin to inform him about the oversupply of heroin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I come now to Lee’s evidence that he had called his drug supplier, Kelvin, and the evidence of a missed call on Phone F2, which Lee relies on in support of his defence (see [23] and [45] above).  To recap, Lee’s evidence is that, after he had weighed the Three Bundles and confirmed what he already knew, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had been wrongly supplied with three one-pound packets of heroin, he made a phone call to Kelvin just before the CNB officers forcibly entered the Room.  The Call Trace Report for Phone A9 indeed shows a phone call being made to a Malaysian number (which, as it is undisputed, is Kelvin’s number) at 9.59pm, and which lasted 3 minutes and 41 seconds.

</div>  Lee’s evidence is that this 9.59pm call was the phone call that he made to Kelvin.  Lee gave evidence that, after this call at 9.59pm was made, he was expecting a call back from Kelvin about the arrangements for the exchange of the Three Bundles (and the return of the additional block of cannabis), but he was arrested before he received any call (see [45] above).  Lee also points to evidence of a missed call shown on Phone F2 (see also [45] above).  He refers to the photo of Phone F2 that was taken by CNB FORT officers on 5 July 2018 at 2.56pm that was entered into evidence, which shows a missed call on this phone (see [45] above).

</div> Instead, it only submits that Lee’s version of events - namely, that the Three Bundles had been unwrapped and weighed before Lee called Kelvin at 9.59pm - is improbable because Lee could not have done all of that in the short period of time after Yap entered the Room and before the call to Kelvin was made.

</div>  As I explain later in this judgment, I have some difficulties with that submission and do not accept it (see [79] below).  For now, it suffices for me to state that, after reviewing the relevant evidence in relation to Lee’s 9.59pm phone call to Kelvin and the missed call on Phone F2 that Lee refers to, I am unable to agree with Lee that these support his claim that he had been oversupplied with heroin on 4 July 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, in relation to Lee’s call to Kelvin at 9.59pm on Phone A9, save for Lee’s bare assertion, there is no other evidence that the call was about Lee informing Kelvin that he had been oversupplied with heroin.  As mentioned earlier, it is not in dispute that Lee used Phone A9 to communicate with Kelvin on the day of his arrest (see [23] above).  Lee also gave evidence that he would use messaging applications like Telegram and WhatsApp to send messages to Kelvin about the arrangements to collect drugs, including the location and the time, although he testified that he could not remember whether he used those messaging applications on Phone A9 or Phone F2.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  Whichever is the case, an examination of the contents of Phone A9 is likely to have shed light on the veracity or otherwise of Lee’s claim that he had been oversupplied with drugs and that he had been communicating with Kelvin about that issue.  After all, according to Lee, immediately after he learnt from Yap (who called him after collecting the drugs at 28/30 Gul Avenue) that there had been an extra “buku” of cannabis, he called Kelvin straight away to ask him about the oversupply of cannabis.  As such, there was a period of at least 30 minutes before Yap arrived at the Room when Lee and Kelvin presumably would have been in some form of communication about the oversupply of cannabis.  Further, according to Lee, after Yap arrived at the Room and unwrapped the Three Bundles, upon which he discovered that he had also been oversupplied with heroin, he called Kelvin again (this was the call at 9.59pm).  Similarly, if Lee’s claim about having been oversupplied with heroin and cannabis were true, one can expect that messages concerning the alleged exchange of the Three Bundles and the return of the additional block of cannabis would have been sent by Kelvin to Lee after the call at 9.59pm.  In my view, the contents of Phone A9 would likely be able to shed some light as to the truth or falsity of Lee’s claim that he had been oversupplied with drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 What is significant, however, is Lee’s attempts to downplay the importance and relevance of Phone A9 to this case.  When Lee was questioned by the Investigating Officer Deputy Superintendent Taufiq Abdul Azim (“DSP Taufiq”) about Phone A9 during the recording of his investigation statement, Lee said: “I cannot remember the telephone number for this handphone.  <span class="font-italic">I seldom use this handphone</span>.

</div>  In light of how Phone A9 had been used by Lee to call Kelvin on 4 July 2018, what Lee had said in his statement is clearly untrue.  During cross-examination, Lee accepted that he downplayed the significance of Phone A9 in his statements recorded by DSP Taufiq.

</div>  It is not in dispute that this was an incorrect password that could not be used to unlock Phone A9. Lee’s evidence is that he thought that he had provided the correct password to DSP Taufiq, and he did not know that “elzd” could not be used to unlock Phone A9 until the time of the trial.

I cannot accept that Lee would not have remembered the password on Phone A9 just a week after using that device.  In my judgment, Lee’s failure to give the correct password for Phone A9 to DSP Taufiq had been deliberate.  Perhaps the reason for Lee’s reluctance to reveal the correct password to DSP Taufiq at that time was because a review of his communications with Kelvin would likely show his exact dealings with Kelvin and that it was Kelvin who was his supplier of drugs and not Yap.  That would have punctured his claim <span class="font-italic">then</span> that Yap was his supplier of heroin.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Lee’s evidence is that he might also have used Phone F2 to communicate with Kelvin.

</div>  As such, it is not possible to determine from which number the missed call on Phone F2 had been made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Given the state of the evidence, I cannot agree with the submission by the Defence that Lee has been able to show that the missed call received on Phone F2 is likely to be from Kelvin, who was calling about the arrangements for the exchange of the three one-pound packets of heroin.  There is simply not enough evidence for the court to come to such a finding.  Aside from Lee’s asserted belief, there is no evidence that the missed call on Phone F2 had been made by Kelvin.  The contents of Phone F2 are also unknown because Lee never provided the password to unlock it and it has since been reset to “factory settings”.  I also reiterate that there is nothing other than Lee’s own bare assertion that his call to Kelvin on Phone A9 at 9.59pm was about the oversupply of heroin.  The record of the 9.59pm call on Phone A9 in and of itself does not provide support to Lee’s claim and its evidential value is only as good as Lee’s own bare assertion.  The contents of Phone A9, which in my view would likely have been able to shed some light on the truth or falsity of Lee’s claim, are unknown as the phone remains locked.  For reasons best known to himself, Lee did not provide the correct password to unlock Phone A9 during the investigation process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Yap’s evidence does not support Lee’s defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Counsel for Lee also points to the evidence of Yap as being supportive of the case that Lee had been oversupplied with drugs.  To be clear, Yap’s evidence in this regard was limited to the alleged oversupply of cannabis.  Yap had given evidence that he was told by Lee to leave one “buku” of cannabis in the car because this had been mistakenly delivered and had to be later sent to somewhere in Bendemeer or Kallang.  Lee argues that this corroborates his claim that he had been given an extra “buku” of cannabis by mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the alleged oversupply of heroin, Yap could not shed very much light on this claim.  This is because Yap’s evidence is that, after he returned to the Room with the drugs and unwrapped the Three Bundles before they were weighed, he does not recall Lee saying anything to the effect that the heroin bundles looked too big or expressing any shock or surprise that the heroin bundles were bigger than what he had ordered.

</div>  While Yap testified that he saw Lee on the phone with someone after the latter had weighed the Three Bundles, Yap’s evidence is that he did not know who Lee was talking to and also did not hear the conversation that Lee was having over the phone (see [30] above).  He was thus not able to say that Lee was speaking on the phone with his drug supplier about being oversupplied with heroin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Nonetheless, Lee submits that the oversupply of cannabis, which Yap can corroborate, is consistent with his case that Kelvin had got his order for drugs wrong, and had given him <span class="font-italic">double</span> the amount of drugs that he had ordered.  Hence, Lee had not only gotten twice the amount of cannabis but also twice the amount of heroin that he ordered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, Lee’s submission does not get off the ground at all.  This is because, when pressed by the DPP during cross-examination, Yap conceded, quite unequivocally, that his earlier oral evidence that the “buku” of cannabis that he had left in the car was to be returned to someone in Bendemeer or Kallang later was a lie.  He accepted that the “buku” of cannabis was his (Yap’s), and that Lee had told him to leave it in the car for that reason.

</div>  This concession completely contradicts Yap’s earlier assertion that Lee had told him that there had been an oversupply of cannabis and that one “buku” of cannabis was to be returned to the supplier.  In my judgment, it is quite clear that Yap had tailored his oral evidence about leaving one “buku” of cannabis in the car to be redelivered to the supplier in a misguided attempt to help Lee in his defence.  For completeness, I should add that Yap also conceded during cross-examination that he had lied in his investigation statement about Lee instructing him to leave one block of cannabis in his car for delivery to someone in Bendemeer to Kallang (see [29] above).  Yap accepted that he made up that lie then in order to distance himself from that block of cannabis (which was actually his) and push the blame to Lee.

I do not see how this evidence is of much assistance to Lee’s defence.  As mentioned earlier, Yap’s evidence is that he did not hear Lee say anything in the Room to the effect that the Three Bundles looked too big.  Yap is also unable to recall whether Lee expressed any surprise about the Three Bundles being bigger than what he had ordered when they were were unwrapped (see [69] above).  Not only that, Yap could not give any evidence as to who Lee had phoned and what that phone conversation was about (see [69] above).

</div>  His evidence is that heroin is typically sold by Malaysia-based suppliers to Singapore-based traffickers in one-pound packets, which are referred to as “batus”.  Each such one-pound packet of heroin would be sold by Malaysia-based suppliers for about $2,200 to $3,600.  As for cannabis, they are usually sold by the Malaysia-based suppliers to Singapore-based traffickers in one-kilogram blocks.  Each block is sold at the price of $1,700 to $2,600.  As such, Insp Tan’s view is that three pounds of heroin and two kilogrammes of cannabis would cost a Singapore-based trafficker $10,000 to $16,000 to buy from a Malaysia-based supplier.

It seemed that Lee might be taking the position that the prices charged by Kelvin for heroin and cannabis were far higher than Insp Tan’s estimates.  However, when Lee took the stand and gave evidence, he sought to justify the $16,000 he paid by explaining that he paid $8,000 for his order of three “halves” of heroin and one “buku” of cannabis.  The other $8,000 was to pay Kelvin for his<span class="font-italic"> previous delivery of drugs</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [43] above).  In other words, Lee was not contesting Insp Tan’s estimates for the prices charged by Malaysia-based suppliers for heroin and cannabis.  A review of Lee’s closing submissions confirmed that Lee was taking the point that he paid only $8,000 for his order of drugs, and the other $8,000 was for a previous supply of drugs which was unpaid as of 4 July 2018.

</div>  In light of his changing evidence, my view is that it is incumbent on Lee to provide some other evidence, whether in the form of messages exchanged with Kelvin or something else, to substantiate his bare assertion that the full $16,000 was not for payment of the delivery of drugs that were received on 4 July 2018.  After all, as I mentioned, Lee does not take issue with Insp Tan’s estimates of the prices charged by Malaysia-based suppliers for heroin and cannabis, and the amount of $16,000 is within the range of prices for the delivered quantity of three one-pound packets of heroin and two one-kilogram blocks of cannabis.  However, Lee provided no evidence whatsoever to support his bare assertion about the amount of $8,000 of the Cash being for an earlier order or earlier orders of drugs that remained unpaid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The same difficulty afflicts Lee’s evidence as to why he claimed to have ordered three “halves” instead of three “batus” of heroin.  This issue had arisen because of Insp Tan’s evidence that Malaysia-based drug suppliers typically transact in one-pound packets of heroin rather than half-pound packets.  Under cross-examination, Lee explained that he had ordered three “halves” at $2,000 each because he had three customers who each wanted half-pound packets.  He therefore asked his Malaysia-based supplier to pre-pack three half-pound packets of heroin which he could then sell directly to his customers.

Lee’s claim of being oversupplied with drugs was only raised late in the day, and he has not been able to maintain a consistent account of how he learnt that he was oversupplied with drugs.  It is also externally inconsistent with Yap’s evidence which, quite clearly, does not support Lee’s claim about what had happened.  It is also a claim that rests entirely on Lee’s bare assertion, and is not supported by any evidence, such as messages which Lee might have exchanged either with his customers who allegedly ordered half-pound packets of heroin, or with Kelvin who allegedly had gotten Lee’s order wrong.  In short, I do not find Lee’s evidence that he only intended to traffic in three “halves” of heroin to be credible.  In my judgment, on the evidence before me, Lee has failed to rebut the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA that he was in possession of the Three Bundles, which contained not less than 24.21g of diamorphine, for the purpose of trafficking.  Accordingly, I find that the elements of the trafficking charge under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA against Lee have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and I convict him accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Yap’s role in the transaction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83  As mentioned earlier, Yap’s evidence at trial is that he had agreed to collect drugs for Lee, but he did not know what type of drugs he would be collecting from 28/30 Gul Avenue, nor the quantity of those drugs.  Yap testified that, when the drugs were thrown into the car by the unidentified male motorcyclist, he knew from sight that there were two “bukus” of cannabis.  After all, those two blocks of cannabis were wrapped in transparent packaging.

The applicable principles were distilled by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>as follows (at [57]-[61] and [64]-[65]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point is for the accused person to give an account of what he thought or believed the thing in his possession was. Whether the presumption of knowledge has been rebutted involves a subjective inquiry into the accused person’s state of mind or knowledge. The court will assess the veracity of the accused person’s assertion as to his subjective state of mind against the objective facts and examine his actions and conduct relating to the item in question in coming to a conclusion on the credibility of his assertion.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is incumbent on the accused person to adduce sufficient evidence disclosing the basis upon which he claims to have arrived at that subjective state of mind.  It is, however, not necessary for the accused person to establish that he held a firm belief as to, or actually knew, what the thing in his possession specifically was; the inquiry is whether the accused person did <span class="font-italic">not </span>in fact know that the thing in question was the specific drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The presumption of knowledge will be rebutted where the court accepts that the accused person formed a <span class="font-italic">positive </span>belief that was incompatible with the knowledge that the thing which he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession.  However, the accused person need not establish a positive state of knowledge as to the contents of the items found in his possession.  Instead, he is only required to establish a <span class="font-italic">negative</span>, namely, that he did not believe that the items in his possession were drugs of the particular nature.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It will not suffice for the accused person to simply claim that he did not know what he was carrying, or if he had been “indifferent” about what the thing in his possession was (namely, where he was in a position to verify or ascertain the nature of what he was carrying but chose not to do so).  In those circumstances, the accused person cannot rebut the presumption of knowledge because he cannot be said to have formed <span class="font-italic">any </span>view as to what the thing in his possession is or is not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As mentioned earlier, Yap’s evidence is that he neither knew what drugs he was collecting at 28/30 Gul Avenue nor the quantity of those drugs that were to be collected, and he also did not ask Lee any questions (see [25] above).   During cross-examination, Yap accepted that he did not care how much drugs he was told by Lee to collect and deliver.  He says that his job was simply to hand over the Cash to the unidentified male motorcyclist and collect whatever drugs were given to him.  During cross-examination, when asked by the DPP what he would have done if the unidentified male motorcyclist at 28/30 Gul Avenue had given him 50 pounds of heroin, Yap testified that he would have still collected it and delivered it to Lee at the Room in the Hotel.

</div>  Yap eventually reached the Hotel at 9.51pm (see [9] above).  Yap therefore had ample time before returning to the Hotel to ascertain the nature of the Three Bundles by unwrapping them in the car but he never did so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In Yap’s written closing submissions, his counsel did not take the position that he had successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew the nature of the drug in the Three Bundles.  In any event, that would have been a hopeless position to take.  As the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, a mere assertion by an accused person that he is ignorant as to the nature of the drug found in his possession cannot suffice to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA (at [65]).  More importantly, Yap’s evidence is to the effect that he was simply “wholly indifferent” to the nature of what was contained in the Three Bundles, in that he did not know what was contained in the Three Bundles and never bothered to find out about the same.  On his evidence, he could not have had any positive belief as to what was contained in the Three Bundles that he had collected.   That being the case, Yap cannot rebut the presumption under s 18(2) that he knew the nature of the drug in the Three Bundles.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Yap’s closing submissions was devoted almost entirely to showing that his role in the transaction involving the Three Bundles was limited to delivering the drugs from 28/30 Gul Avenue to Lee at the Room in the Hotel.  In short, it was to establish that Yap acted only as a courier and thus his actions <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Three Bundles fall within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA.  From the position taken by the Prosecution, I do not think that Yap’s role in this regard is in dispute.
