</div> There were no eyewitnesses to the incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt the charge against Leslie and that he had been unable, on a balance of probabilities, to prove any of the special exceptions relied on. I therefore convicted him on the charge. I exercised my discretion under s 302(2) of the Penal Code and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Prosecution’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Prosecution’s narrative was summarised in its closing submissions. Leslie and the Deceased were lovers. She believed that he was divorced and the scion of a successful laundry business. He took advantage of her trust by taking $20,000 (about RMB100,000) from her on the pretext of investing it in gold on her behalf. Instead, he used the money for his own purposes. In fact, Leslie was a married, bankrupt ex-convict who was merely an employee in a laundry business. He had cheated on his wife with several women, cheated others of money and cheated his employers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Deceased was just another person to satisfy Leslie’s financial needs and sexual urges. Unfortunately, he grossly underestimated her. She refused to accept his excuses and grew increasingly unhappy with him in the months leading up to her death. She wanted him to spend more time with her and not on his work or with his “ex-wife”, and even sent a message to his “ex-wife” telling her to leave him. This was significant as the last time one of Leslie’s lovers confronted his wife, his dishonesty and criminal conduct were exposed and he was jailed and bankrupted.

</div> The Deceased was also demanding the return of her investment moneys but Leslie only managed to return half the amount to her. A day before the killing, the Deceased had pressed him for the balance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 12 July 2016, the Deceased informed Leslie that she was going to his workplace to speak to his bosses. Leslie knew that his façade of virtue and wealth would be shattered if she did so, and was desperate to stop her at all costs. He called her to dissuade her from going to his workplace, attempted to assuage her concerns by getting his employer to speak to her on the phone, intercepted her at Joo Koon MRT station to try and “talk her down”, and when all that failed, strangled her. He then burnt her body, scattered her ashes and disposed of her personal effects. The Deceased was going to unravel the web of lies that Leslie had spun spanning every facet of his life, and he therefore prevented her from exposing his crimes, infidelity and lies by killing her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for additional witnesses </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Prosecution sought to call nine additional witnesses under s 231(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). They were the Deceased’s parents, those cheated by Leslie (Yvonne Lim Siew Li (“Yvonne”), Eric Ng (“Eric”) and Zhao Cui Lan (“Cui Lan”)) and his ex-girlfriends/lovers (Karen Kang (“Karen”), Linda Lim Bee Ling (“Linda”), Zhang Hong and Hu Qin).

</div> Character evidence was inadmissible unless an accused person first adduced evidence of good character. Also, the Prosecution’s argument on motive was speculative as there was no evidence to show that the Deceased knew that Leslie was cheating others. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Prosecution argued that the point was not that the Deceased knew about Leslie’s cheating but that she would set off a train of inquiry. Her threats were potentially disastrous to his reputation and could expose him to criminal liability. Further, Leslie had made his character an issue as he repeatedly claimed that the Deceased was threatening to tarnish his reputation. The evidence was also relevant because Leslie had made various claims in his statements regarding the source of the moneys and what he did with them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I accepted that the Disputed Witnesses’ evidence might be relevant, in particular, to provide context and show whether Leslie had a motive to silence the Deceased, and hence shed light on his intention and <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> at the time of the incident. This is especially when there were no eyewitnesses and the case would largely turn on Leslie’s testimony and circumstantial evidence. Even if the Deceased did not know that Leslie was cheating others, the point is that Leslie did, and this could potentially be his undoing should she speak to his bosses and they put two and two together. The Disputed Witnesses’ evidence might be relevant to Leslie’s defence of diminished responsibility. He claimed that he suffered from Intermittent Explosive Disorder (“IED”), which manifests with close associates including ex-girlfriends. Hence any behaviour observed by them could shed light on his purported condition. I therefore allowed Karen, Yvonne, Cui Lan, Eric and Linda to be called, but cautioned that I was not determining the weight (if any) to be attached to the evidence just yet.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Admissibility under s 32(1)(j)(iii) and (iv) of the Evidence Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 As for Hu Qin’s and Zhang Hong’s evidence, the Prosecution sought to admit their statements under s 259(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC read with ss 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii) and (iv) of the Evidence Act, given that they were out of jurisdiction and would not be testifying.

</div> He had recorded Hu Qin’s conditioned statement on 13 March 2018, when she was working in Singapore. She left Singapore in June 2018. IO Tan contacted her via WeChat three times in early 2019. Each time, she refused to come to Singapore without giving reasons. As for Zhang Hong, she had left Singapore in June 2016 but IO Tan managed to interview and take a statement from her on 7 October 2016 when she came to Singapore for work. She then left Singapore. IO Tan contacted her via WeChat shortly before the committal hearing in 2018 and again in March 2019, but each time she refused to come to Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Defence accepted that the requirements of s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Evidence Act were satisfied and instead grounded its objection on s 32(3). It argued that the evidence of Hu Qin and Zhang Hong was of limited probative value because the Prosecution had already lined up several witnesses in that regard. It could not be proved that Leslie would have a stronger motive because there was one more alleged girlfriend or cheating victim. Further, the evidence would be unreliable due to the lack of cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 While noting that parts of Hu Qin’s and Zhang Hong’s statements might not be relevant to the issues at trial, I was not prepared to rule out their statements entirely. Hu Qin stated that Leslie had met her for a meal, which was just two days after he had strangled the Deceased. Zhang Hong’s statement would reveal where the money Leslie used to partially repay the Deceased came from. Their statements might support the Prosecution’s case on whether Leslie had a motive to silence the Deceased and how he could disengage himself from the killing. At that stage, Leslie had not yet elected or gone on the stand to testify, and hence the issues in dispute had yet to be completely crystallised. I therefore allowed the statements to be admitted, but again cautioned that I was not determining the weight (if any) to be attached to them yet.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defence’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Defence submitted that Leslie was only guilty of culpable homicide punishable under s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code, as the act was probably done with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death, without intention to cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death.

Leslie’s relationship with the Deceased was “not always peaceful”, and there were instances of her flaring up and then cooling off. The Defence adduced two videos. One showed the Deceased raising her voice at Leslie regarding certain posts she saw on his Facebook page, and another showed her moving her hand towards him and what looked like her knocking his handphone out of his hand when she realised he was filming her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The events of the day leading up to the Deceased’s death were entirely unplanned. In the wee hours of 12 July 2016, the Deceased had called Leslie seven times. By the time he returned her calls, she was highly agitated. He could not calm her down despite speaking to her on the phone several times. He then left home and drove to Joo Koon MRT station to pick her up, with the intention of pacifying her. On the way, he set up a conference call with the Deceased and his supervisor, Adeline Toh (“Adeline”), to get Adeline to calm her down. Adeline asked them to meet her at Westin Hotel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 When the Deceased boarded the Car, she scolded him and threatened to go to his office to verify if he was really so busy. As Leslie was driving to Westin Hotel, the Deceased changed her mind and refused to go there. He then drove to find a place to stop the Car and talk to her.  They ended up near Gardens by the Bay. Leslie believed that he could pacify the Deceased, as was the case in the past. Unfortunately, he could not. She continued scolding him, confronting him about him being busy with work, and insisting on going to his workplace to verify this. Though he apologised, kowtowed to her in the Car and begged her not to blow things up, she was not pacified. He then gave up, told her to do whatever she wanted and unlocked the Car intending to get out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Deceased then used her hand to hit Leslie and wanted to continue hitting him but he managed to pin her hands down on her lap, telling her not to resort to physical violence. However, she broke free and intended to hit him again. He pushed her away, but she continued coming at him whilst scolding him. He became agitated, there was a lot of shouting in the Car, and things were happening very quickly. Suddenly the Deceased was not moving and Leslie found, at that point, that his right hand was on her neck. He tried to wake her, to no avail. He checked for her breathing and realised that she had died. He was frightened and drove around aimlessly, not knowing what to do. It was only on the next day that he decided to dispose of the body.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Leslie did not intend to strangle the Deceased with the knowledge that such strangulation would likely cause her harm and death. He did not have the time to form that intention given the way things unfolded and escalated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Undisputed facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I first set out the undisputed facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Leslie, who has been an undischarged bankrupt since July 2010, is married to one Mdm Toh, and they have a son. They were residing at Orchid Park Condominium. He was employed as a Retail Outlet Manager for Dryclyn Express Pte Ltd (“Dryclyn”). He drove the Car, a black BMW, which belonged to Mdm Toh. Leslie and the Deceased became acquainted sometime in 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On 7 July 2016, the Deceased sent Mdm Toh a Facebook message: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You hv been already divorced, so please leave Leslie far ...... away!!!

The main events on that day were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the early morning, the Deceased called Leslie numerous times. He did not pick up her calls. He then called her twice. The Deceased subsequently left the flat she was staying at. Leslie called her again.

Leslie called her. At 7.25am, he called Adeline, and then called the Deceased again. At 7.36am, the Deceased exited the gantry at Joo Koon MRT station. Shortly after, Leslie made a conference call to Adeline and the Deceased. He then called the Deceased. At 7.51am, the Deceased exited Joo Koon MRT station, boarded the Car at 8.00am and sat in the front passenger seat. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Between 8.00am to 9.48am, Leslie stopped the Car along Marina Gardens Drive. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At 9.48am, Leslie drove into the Gardens by the Bay East (“GBTBE”) carpark.

It was unbelievable that Leslie would oblige the Deceased and, despite claiming she was a “greedy” person, would listen to her ranting and “blasting” at him and her constant complaints that he was not spending enough time with her, if he merely treated her as a casual friend. I disbelieved that he was nice to her and tolerated her behaviour only because she had handed him $20,000 sometime in 2016.

But she changed her mind and told me she will instead post on to all my friends' and wife's facebook to tarnish my reputation. She want to post that I have been lying to her about busy work schedule and she will divulge that the laundry is my family business.

I don’t know how long I pressed and I was not looking at her. After a while, I realised she was not grabbing onto my hand anymore and she was not moving. I looked at her and she was lying backward. I let go of my hand and was very frightened. I started to use my hand to hit on her chest to wake her up, but she did not response. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Regarding the 6th Statement, Leslie stated in court that he did not inform IO Tan, and that it was not true, that he had stretched out his right arm and grabbed the Deceased’s neck or that he had ground his teeth so hard and “pressed on her neck very hard with [his] right hand”. I disbelieved that he did not inform IO Tan as such and rejected his claim that it was IO Tan who had asked him if he had ground his teeth. Leslie’s attention was drawn specifically to these sentences in the Statement, as seen from the handwritten cancellations and additions that he had initialled against.

However, contrary to the Defence’s case that <span class="font-italic">the Deceased’s </span>change of mind was the decisive factor, Leslie was in control of the Car and was not prevented from going to Westin Hotel just because she had changed her mind. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Place where strangulation occurred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The strangulation happened at Marina Gardens Drive.

This assertion was made for the first time in cross-examination, and it was inconceivable that the Deceased could have successfully restrained him by grabbing or pulling at his chest given the disparity in their size. He was about 1.79m tall and over 80kg then, while she was about 1.58m tall and about 54kg. Leslie admitted that he would have been able to leave the Car if he wanted to, as he was stronger and bigger than the Deceased.

In court, he denied driving to a secluded road to calm the Deceased down and persuade her not to expose him.

In the 3rd Statement he claimed that, in the Car, they first had a conversation about their friendship, before arguing and struggling which led to her death. In the 6th Statement he further claimed that he “gave up” and told her that she could go by herself to the company, but that she changed her mind and told him she would tarnish his reputation on Facebook. I was cognisant that Leslie might have given a completely different account at the beginning of investigations to disassociate himself completely from the Deceased’s death. Nevertheless, the inconsistent accounts underscored the unreliability of his evidence. In any case, I disbelieved that he had actually given the Deceased an opportunity to leave the Car and go by herself to his company and that she chose not to. It was unbelievable that despite her threats to go and confront his bosses, and despite him not wanting her to destroy his work and reputation,

He recalled in detail what he did after the strangulation, how he placed the Deceased’s body in the Car, how he drove around Singapore, and how he thought of disposing her body.

</div> It was clear that he wanted to ensure that no one would discover the body. Hence he had purchased the burning materials and used them on her body more than once, and dragged the body to the drain at night to let it continue to burn (whilst he poured more kerosene on it) so that “no one will discover it”.  Leslie then disposed of the empty charcoal packages and kerosene tins at a large dustbin near Lim Chu Kang Lane 8.

</div> His response was “I don’t know. I didn’t know. I didn’t think of this”, which was inconsistent with what he later stated (at [106]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>above). This was a case in which the dangers of Leslie’s act of grabbing the Deceased’s neck with force would have been so self-evident that he would know that this would likely cause her death. In any event, Leslie himself knew such an act to the Deceased was very dangerous and likely to cause her death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Next, I found that Leslie intended to grab and compress the Deceased’s neck, and disbelieved his claim that the killing was an accident and that he had no intention to strangle the Deceased. I reiterate my findings at [89]–[92]. His accounts in the 6th Statement and to IO Tan, Dr Ung and Dr Koh showed that he could recall grabbing the Deceased’s neck and pressing for some time before she turned motionless, he was cognisant of what he was doing (as recorded in IO Tan’s field book, Leslie had strangled the Deceased’s neck until she was motionless), and he knew the force he applied (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he ground his teeth and pressed on her neck very hard).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Additionally, I found that Leslie had a motive for killing the Deceased, to rid himself of the financial pressure and threat of exposure and ruin to him that she posed. While motive is not the same as intention, the presence of motive may bolster the inference of intention to commit the offence. In <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 at [58], the court stated that motive “is helpful in appropriate circumstances by casting valuable (and even significant) light on the <span class="font-italic">intention</span> of an accused”, and where there were no independent eyewitnesses, ascertaining whether an accused had a motive in the killing in order to silence the deceased would be an important issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Leslie was under financial pressure as the Deceased was pressing him for repayment of the $20,000, and he did not have the funds and was scrambling to find the money. He sought Zhang Hong’s help to pay $10,000 and unsuccessfully asked Eric for another $10,000 just a day before he strangled the Deceased. Around that time, Mdm Toh was also pressing Leslie for money to pay the family expenses, as seen from her text messages between June to July 2016.

</div> However, this was not posed to Leslie in court for his explanation, and it could equally be said that he had returned some money to the Deceased in the hope of placating her or to buy time. Pertinently, he never mentioned to the investigating authorities that the Deceased had handed him <span class="font-italic">any </span>money, even categorically denying this when asked in the 9th Statement. He only decided to “tell … the truth” in the 10th Statement, and even then, sought to portray that he had, by returning her $10,000, discharged his obligation on the $20,000 completely as he claimed to have repaid her some money on previous occasions. Clearly, Leslie attempted to downplay that he was under financial pressure, so that it would not raise any suspicions of a motive to silence the Deceased. When he voluntarily made the 10th Statement, he stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I should tell you the truth.

This revelation of his lie could catalyse an inquiry against him and lead to the unravelling of his other lies (such as his dealings with money belonging to Dryclyn and the various “investment” schemes – see [39]–[44]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>above).<span style="color: rgba(0,176,80,1)"> </span>Even if the Deceased was unaware that Leslie was cheating others or on her, Leslie knew what he had done and where this could potentially lead to if she were to confront his bosses or Mdm Toh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As Leslie himself stated, he had begged the Deceased not to complain to his bosses <span class="font-italic">because he did not want her to destroy </span><span class="font-italic">the reputation</span> he had built up, and that if the Deceased complained to his wife, <span class="font-italic">his whole life, his job and his family would be over/destroyed</span>.

Leslie’s ever-morphing account belied his credibility and showed that he was exaggerating the gravity of the alleged provocations to buttress his defence.

In the 3rd Statement, he stated that he had not only called Adeline (to talk to the Deceased) but he also chose to drive to Gardens by the Bay because he “decided to calm her down by talking to her at a quiet place”. In the 6th Statement, he stated that when she first scolded him, he kept quiet and let her rant, and likewise made the decision to stop at a “secluded road” to try to “talk to her and cool her down”. Even after she purportedly continued to shout at and scold him, he did not retaliate but instead begged with her. From his own account, despite the Deceased’s ranting and scolding, he could think clearly throughout, arranging for a conference call with Adeline to seek her help and deciding to stop at a secluded place to pacify the Deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Second, Leslie did not lose self-control during the strangulation.

Mdm Toh had also informed Dr Koh and Dr Ung that she hoped their reports would be favourable to Leslie. That said, when Dr Koh first interviewed Mdm Toh in 2016 to prepare his first report (where she gave an account of Leslie’s past behaviour), there was no evidence that she was cognisant of the defence of IED. Likewise, when Dr Koh interviewed her in February 2019 (to prepare his second report), there was no evidence that she had seen the DSM-5 criteria. Her unsolicited email to Dr Koh on 18 February 2019 came only after he had shown her the DSM-5 criteria. Dr Ung also stated that he had not shown Mdm Toh the DSM-5 criteria.

</div> It was also unclear how the Partition Wall and Pen Incidents caused a marked distress in Leslie, or an impairment in his occupational functioning or interpersonal functioning, or were associated with financial or legal consequences. Dr Ung agreed that the Incidents did not cause any occupational impairment, consistent with Dr Koh’s opinion.

Dr Ung’s attention was not drawn to these incidents, even in court, and his report did not mention them or that they occurred in 2015–2016 in coming to his conclusion that Leslie had lifetime IED.  In any event, even when Dr Koh was cross-examined about the Handphone Incident, he opined that Leslie had some control over his violent outbursts given that he had decided to throw something (the handphone) to prevent himself from hitting his wife. Dr Koh also opined that Criterion B was not satisfied as Leslie’s act did not seem to be excessive or out of proportion, and Criterion C was not met as Leslie’s outburst was goal-directed.

Criterion C was not met, as I had earlier found that Leslie had a motive to strangle the Deceased to rid himself of the financial pressure and threat of exposure and ruin to him that she posed. Leslie had committed the act of strangulation to achieve some tangible objective. Dr Ung accepted that if the offender was acting aggressively to stop the victim from attempting to extract money from him or to prevent the victim from spilling the beans and ruining the offender’s reputation, business or personal life, the act would be committed to achieve a tangible objective. Dr Ung also accepted that if a person acts with a motive, as a means to an end, then the act would not be reactive.

Dr Ung opined that Leslie was a vulnerable individual as he was suffering from IED (the point being that he was prone to reacting more severely to day-to-day stresses as he had an impulse control disorder). However, Dr Ung conceded that even if Leslie had lifetime IED, that did not mean that every act of aggression was caused by IED because the act could nevertheless be deliberate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Dr Ung also relied on the concept of “narcissistic rage” (which was not a mental disorder) but conceded that this “would have contributed” to Leslie’s anger and violence. If so, this would have undermined Dr Ung’s opinion that the killing was caused by the manifestation of IED:

I had found that Leslie knew what he was doing at the material time and there was no loss of self-control on his part. He was lucid during the killing, as demonstrated by his ability to recollect numerous details regarding what he did, including pressing on the Deceased’s neck so hard he ground his teeth and thinking to himself why she did not “stop the nonsense”. In the immediate aftermath, Leslie could think clearly and even attempted to cover his tracks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In the round, although Leslie has lifetime IED dating back to 2002, I found that the IED did not manifest when he committed the offence. In any event, Leslie had failed to show that any abnormality of mind had substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the act. Accordingly, the defence of diminished responsibility was not made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Having found that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Defence had failed to show on a balance of probabilities the defence of provocation, sudden fight or diminished responsibility, I convicted Leslie of the charge. Section 302(2) of the Penal Code confers a discretion on the court to sentence an accused person convicted under s 300(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to either life imprisonment and caning, or death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The death penalty is warranted where the actions of the offender outrage the feelings of the community, and this would be the case where these actions exhibit viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. The manner at which the offender acted takes centre stage, and relevant considerations include the number of stabs or blows inflicted, the area of injury, the duration of the attack, the force used, the mental state of the offender, and the offender’s actual role or participation in the attack: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Lie Sian v </span><span class="font-italic">PP</span> [2019] SGCA 44 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Lie Sian</span>”) at [84]–[85].  In <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chia Kee Chen</span> [2018] 2 SLR 249 (“<span class="font-italic">Chia Kee </span><span class="font-italic">Chen”</span>) at [139], the court also considered whether the accused demonstrated a high degree of planning and premeditation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 No doubt, I found that Leslie had a motive to silence the Deceased, to rid himself of the financial pressure and threat of exposure that she posed. Nevertheless, I did not consider that what he had done warranted the imposition of the death penalty. The evidence did not suggest that Leslie had planned to kill the Deceased when he first met up with her on 12 July 2016. As the Prosecution submitted, and which I agreed, Leslie was likely caught unaware that the Deceased had seriously intended to confront his bosses on that day. Indeed, Leslie’s plan all along was to attempt to dissuade her from so doing – he set up a three-way conference call with Adeline to enlist her help, intercepted the Deceased at Joo Koon MRT station, and when the Deceased did not want to meet Adeline, he decided to bring her to a secluded place to calm or talk her down. In my view, all these showed that Leslie did not regard attacking, much less killing, the Deceased as his first or main solution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 There was also no evidence to show that Leslie’s act was brutal or vicious such as to warrant the death penalty. Whilst I found that Leslie had compressed the Deceased’s neck with great force, I was unable to conclude for how long he had strangled her. The act of killing here involved a single act of grabbing the Deceased’s neck. There was no evidence that this was a sustained onslaught. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Finally, even if Leslie had not called for help after he saw the Deceased become motionless, and had gone to great lengths to dispose of her body, these were not relevant sentencing considerations. An examination of the accused’s regard for human life must necessarily be informed by his knowledge and state of mind at the relevant time (<span class="font-italic">Chan Lie Sian</span> at [88]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen</span> stated (at [142]), that the death sentence is the final and terminal sentence which a convicted person can suffer, and where it is at the discretion of the court, it should only be imposed after the most anxious consideration. Having regard to the facts and circumstances, I was not satisfied that this was a case which warranted the imposition of the death penalty. The Prosecution had also stated that it was not seeking the death penalty. Accordingly, I sentenced Leslie to life imprisonment. As Leslie is above 50 years old, he cannot be caned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Pursuant to s 318(1) of the CPC, I exercised my discretion to backdate the sentence to the date of Leslie’s remand, as requested by the Defence and to which the Prosecution did not object.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hri Kumar Nair SC, Tan Wen Hsien, Sarah Shi, Stephanie Koh and Jocelyn Teo (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Public Prosecutor;<br/>Mervyn Cheong (Advocatus Law LLP), Andy Yeo (Eldan Law LLP) and Chooi Jing Yen (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
