The present appeal exemplifies this in a very stark manner. The crux of this appeal is the interpretation of just one phrase – “serious misconduct”. More specifically, the question which arises is whether the plaintiff-employee (“the Respondent”) was guilty of “serious misconduct” within the scope of a particular term of his employment contract (“the Employment Contract”), thus precluding him from claiming benefits from the defendant-employer (“the Appellant”) following the termination of his employment pursuant to the term(s) of the Employment Contract itself. The High Court judge (“the Judge”) answered this question in the negative, thus resulting in the Respondent succeeding in his claim. The Judge’s decision was reported as <span class="font-italic">Piattchanine, Iouri v Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1257 (“the Judgment”), and regard should be had, in particular, to the reasons he gave at [252]–[262] of the Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>We observe, parenthetically, that there was another phrase in the same clause (cl 20 of the Employment Contract (“Cl 20”)), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “wilful breach or non-observance” which had to be interpreted by the Judge. The Judge also found in favour of the Respondent on this point and held that his conduct did not amount to wilful breach or non-observance of his obligations under the Employment Contract (see [263]–[265] of the Judgment). As will be apparent, this latter phrase poses relatively fewer difficulties when compared to the former phrase (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “serious misconduct”). It is noteworthy that the Judge did not appear to be entirely comfortable with his finding that the Respondent had not been guilty of “serious misconduct” under Cl 20. This also serves to underscore the difficult issues of application alluded to right at the outset of this judgment</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>Indeed, as will be explained below, we do not agree wholly with the approach the Judge adopted in his interpretation of Cl 20 in general and the phrase “serious misconduct” (contained therein) in particular. In order to avoid running ahead of the analysis, we will only say at this juncture that whilst the Judge sought to apply what he perceived were the governing principles at common law, he did not, with respect, apply the <span class="font-italic">full</span> complement of legal principles that are presently part of the Singapore legal landscape in so far as the issue of discharge by breach is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>We should also note that there is the further issue of the Appellant’s <span class="font-italic">counter</span><span class="font-italic">claim</span> against the Respondent which the Judge allowed in part and which we will also deal with in the course of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>By way of a final (albeit subsidiary) observation, we will also demonstrate that some of the legal reasoning leading to the Judge’s decision with regard to the Respondent’s claim – in particular his endorsement of the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh v William Evans Ltd</span> [2013] 1 WLR 238 (“<span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>”) – was not, strictly speaking, necessary. We are loath to add more <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> about <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> but, because some of the legal principles referred to by the Judge were not only unnecessary but also (and more importantly) not fully explored, we will set out some brief views in a Coda to this judgment in order to flag out some important legal issues that will need to be considered in more detail when they next come before the courts for a definitive ruling. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>We begin with a summary of the facts and the Judge’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relevant background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>The facts were set out comprehensively by the Judge at [2]–[29] of the Judgment, and we gratefully adopt them.

Phosint is, in turn, fully owned by the Phosagro Group, which is based in Russia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>On 26 February 2013, Phosint entered into a share purchase agreement (“the SPA”) for the purchase of Asiafert Trading Pte Ltd (“Asiafert”). The Respondent was the sole director and shareholder of Asiafert at that time. After Phosint bought over Asiafert, they renamed it Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Appellant). Pursuant to the terms in the SPA, the Respondent’s employment as Managing Director of Asiafert was to be continued on mutually agreeable terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondent’s employment contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>On 1 March 2013, the Appellant hired the Respondent as its Managing Director pursuant to the Employment Contract. The draft of the Employment Contract was prepared by the Respondent and he signed his own Employment Contract on behalf of the Appellant. It should be noted the Appellant did not and does not challenge the validity of the salient terms in the Employment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>Some of the salient terms of the Employment Contract are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. Subject as hereinafter provided the employment <span class="font-italic">shall commence on 1</span><span class="font-italic">st March, 2013</span> for the period of three years having the option to be renewed by another term with parties intentions to be decided one year before expiry of the first term unless terminated by either party to the agreement by giving to the other party not less than three months’ notice in writing. 100% annual salary as one-off payment to be settled in case contract is terminated before expiry of it’s validity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. During the continuance of this agreement, the employee shall, unless prevented by ill-health, devote such of his time and attention to the business of the Company as shall be required for the proper performance of his duties and in all respects conform to and comply with the directions and regulations of the Board of directors of the Company and shall well and faithfully serve the Company in all respects and use his best endeavours to promote the interests of the Company. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. The employee shall be entitled to receive annual bonuses as specified from time to time. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.   … Except of any reason stipulated in Point 20 of this Employment Contract, if the employee is terminated or resigns prior to the completion of his contractual period, <span class="font-italic">annual salary </span><span class="font-italic">as one-off payment</span> to be settled in full, should the contract is terminated before expiry of its validity. employer shall give employee, or vice versa, three months’ notice in writing. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20. If at any time during his employment, hereunder the employee shall be guilty of any serious misconduct or any wilful breach or non-observance of any of the stipulations herein contained and on his part to be observed or performed or shall compound with his creditors generally or shall have a Receiving Order in bankruptcy made against him then and in any such case, the Company may terminate the employee’s employment hereunder without any notice or payment in lieu of notice. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>Pursuant to the Employment Contract, the Respondent was entitled to a salary of $40,600 per month from 1 March 2013 to 31 December 2013, and $47,300 per month thereafter. The Respondent was also entitled to receive a guaranteed bonus equal to 50% of his annual remuneration, as well as a discretionary bonus of up to 50% of his annual remuneration. Besides salary and bonuses, the Respondent was also entitled to the following benefits under the Employment Contract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 7: to have a telephone and to have overseas telephone bills incurred in discharge of his duties paid for by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 8: to have his utility bills paid for by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 9: club membership fees, membership fees in various business clubs which are deemed beneficial to the Appellant’s business, as well as fees for language courses, business schools, and seminars would be borne by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 10: the Appellant was to provide a motorcar “of suitable type” for official and private use (all associated expenses including petrol and parking fees were to be paid for by the Appellant).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Clause 11: to be reimbursed for all travelling, hotel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred during business trips “according to the Company regulations”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Clause 12: to be reimbursed for all entertainment expenses reasonably incurred in discharge of his duties in “accordance with the Company regulations”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Clause 13: to be provided free medical consultations and medicine for him and his family. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Clause 15: his and his family’s travelling expenses during annual leave would be borne by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Clause 19: the Appellant was to purchase life and accident insurance policies for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For ease of reference, we will refer to the above expenses which the Respondent was entitled to claim for as “corporate expenses” and we will refer to all other expenses incurred by the Respondent as “personal expenses”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The management of the Appellant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>The Respondent managed the Appellant with one Maxim Popov (“Popov”), who was an executive director of the Appellant. As Managing Director of the Appellant, the Respondent had wide-ranging powers to run the Appellant’s business and entertain actual or potential business partners. The Respondent did not have to report to anybody when making day-to-day financial decisions and there were no rules relating to the corporate governance of the Appellant imposed by the new owners (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Phosagro Group). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>When it came to the handling of finances, the process in place was that the Respondent would, on a monthly basis, submit his credit card expenses together with supporting receipts to the Appellant’s external accountant, Tricor Singapore Pte Ltd (“Tricor”). The Respondent used the credit card primarily for corporate expenses, although he would occasionally use it for personal expenses as well. After submitting the credit card statements, the Respondent would then sign a cheque to himself as reimbursement for his expenses. The same process applied to Popov – that is to say, he would also submit his credit card statements accompanied by the supporting receipts to Tricor at the end of each month for reimbursement – although it was the Respondent who would sign the cheques to Popov. According to the Respondent, at the end of the financial year, Tricor would identify expense claims that the Respondent and Popov were not, or appeared not to be, entitled to and seek reimbursement from them. The Judge and the parties referred to this as the “Expense Accounting Practice”. It should be noted that there was no documentary evidence to support the existence of the Expense Accounting Practice and the only evidence on this issue came from the testimony of the Respondent. The Appellant, however, did not dispute the existence of such an accounting practice at the trial below and does not do so either in the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>According to the Respondent, the Expense Accounting Practice was carried over from Asiafert, where he was the sole shareholder and director. The Expense Accounting Practice was never directly communicated to the Phosagro Group, although the Appellant’s management accounts would be sent to the Phosagro Group every month with the directors’ expenses listed therein. However, a detailed breakdown of the expenses would not be found in those accounts. It should also be noted that the Appellant had no regulations to govern either its accounting practices or the process by which the entertainment and expense claims of the directors were to be processed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Termination of the Respondent’s employment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>Shortly after the Respondent started work with the Appellant, tensions arose between the Respondent on the one hand, and Popov and the officers from the Phosagro Group on the other. These disagreements related to the direction of the Appellant’s business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>In February 2014, the Respondent became aware that a director of the Phosagro Group, one Sergey Sereda (“Sereda”), would be appointed to the Appellant’s board of directors. The Respondent then sought legal advice from M/s Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“R&amp;T”) on whether there would be a conflict of interest if Sereda were to be both a director of the Appellant as well as a director of the Phosagro Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>In its legal advice, R&amp;T opined that there would likely be a conflict of interest for the same person to act as director of both a parent and subsidiary company. The Respondent forwarded this legal advice to Phosint’s solicitors on 26 February 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>On 27 February 2014, the Respondent received an email from Andre Guryev (“Guryev”), the CEO of the Phosagro Group, which contained only one line: “<span class="font-italic">What r </span><span class="font-italic">u doing?</span>”. The Respondent replied to Guryev on the same day, explaining that he had sought the legal advice in the interest of the company and the shareholders. Guryev did not reply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>The very next day, on 28 February 2014, the Respondent received a termination letter from the Appellant which was signed by Popov (“the 28 February 2014 Letter”). The material paragraphs of the 28 February 2014 Letter are as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">1. This letter serves as notice that your employment as a Director of Phosagro Asia Pte.

In fact, we reserve the right to assert a set off and/or make a claim for the monies wrongfully paid out. This may include a claim for other sums which may not have been specifically referred to in this letter. As such, for the avoidance of doubt, all rights are reserved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The 18 March 2014 Letter was accompanied by a stack of receipts relating to the allegedly wrongful expense claims made by the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>On 4 April 2014, the Respondent’s solicitors sent a letter to the Appellant claiming that there was no basis for the allegations made in the 18 March 2014 Letter.

In this regard, the Judge made the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Category A</span> expenses: this was not in issue as the Respondent accepted that he was not entitled to these sums.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Category B</span> expenses: the Judge found that the Respondent was not entitled to claim for expenses which were incurred prior to 1 March 2013 even if they were business expenses of Asiafert (see the Judgment at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Category C</span> expenses: the Judge found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Respondent was not entitled to these sums. The Judge noted that the Respondent, when probed, was always able to explain the business meetings he attended on these overseas trips. The Judge further held that in the absence of specific company regulations to the contrary, even “mixed business and personal trips” – that is to say, trips where the Respondent was accompanied by his family and where he had a number of business meetings but did not spend all his time working – qualified as “business trips” (see the Judgment at [70]−[71]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Category D</span> expenses: the Judge found that there were a large number of items in respect of which no evidence was adduced at trial to show why the Respondent was not entitled to them. Of those items which the Appellant specifically adduced evidence on, the Judge only found that a transaction for a spa service at St Regis Hotel was a personal expense which the Respondent was not entitled to claim for (see the Judgment at [77]−[78]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">Category E</span> expenses: the Judge found that they were legitimate business expenses incurred by the Respondent in the discharge of his duties (see the Judgment at [79]−[85]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) <span class="font-italic">Category F</span> expenses: the Judge found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that these claims were wrongful and that the Respondent had managed, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, to give reasonable explanations for each hotel expense he was questioned about. His general explanation was that these expenses were spent on hosting actual or potential business partners who came to Singapore (see the Judgment at [86]−[88]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) <span class="font-italic">Category G</span> expenses: the Judge found that the Respondent was not entitled to claim for taxi travel given that the Appellant had already provided him with a motor car (see the Judgment at [89]−[90]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) <span class="font-italic">Category H</span> expenses: the Judge found that the payment to BNP Paribas was a corporate expense. The Judge noted that the Appellant was not claiming for losses flowing from the Respondent’s negligence so even if the charges would not have been incurred had the Respondent not been careless in failing to close the overdraft, this would not change the character of the payment to BNP Paribas; it would still be a corporate expense (see the Judgment at [96]). As for the Fincastle Trading Ltd payments, the Judge found that the payments were made as part of the Respondent’s annual bonus and were legitimate (see the Judgment at [98]−[99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>As for the Respondent’s Alternative Claim, the critical issue before the Judge was whether the Appellant was entitled to terminate the Respondent without any notice or payment in lieu of notice, which the Respondent would ordinarily have been due under cl 14 of the Employment Contract. This question turns on whether the Respondent was guilty of any serious misconduct or wilful breach or non-observance of any of the stipulations in the Employment Contract (as <span class="font-italic">per</span> cl 20 of the Employment Contract), which would entitle the Appellant to terminate the contract without paying the aforementioned sums (see the Judgment at [214]–[215]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>The Judge held that the Respondent had breached cl 3 of the Employment Contract (“Cl 3”) to “faithfully serve the Company in all respects and use his best endeavours to promote the interests of the Company” by applying the Expense Accounting Practice. According to the Judge, the Respondent’s practice of claiming for personal expenses during the year, and only reimbursing the Appellant for these expenses when and if Tricor raised queries at the end of the financial year, could not be said to be in the interest of the Appellant. The Judge found that by so doing, there was a likelihood that not all the personal expenses claimed by the Respondent would be reimbursed to the Appellant since it would have been impossible for Tricor to determine which of the claimed expenses were legitimate corporate expenses and which were the Respondent’s personal expenses which he was not entitled to claim for (see the Judgment at [237]−[238]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>For the same reasons (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by utilising the Expense Accounting Practice), the Judge also held that the Respondent had breached his implied contractual duty to serve the Appellant with good faith and fidelity (see the Judgment at [242]) and his fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Appellant (see the Judgment at [249]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>The Judge, however, found that although there were these breaches on the part of the Respondent, he was not guilty of serious misconduct or wilful breach or non-observance of the stipulations in the Employment Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>With respect to whether there was “serious misconduct”, the Judge found that the breaches complained of were not so serious that they struck at the root of the Employment Contract or destroyed the confidence underlying the Contract. The Judge reached this conclusion on the basis that the Phosagro Group and its shareholders seemed to show little to no interest in regulating the way the finances of the Appellant were managed when it came to issues like entertainment expenses or employment benefits. Further, the Judge accepted that the Respondent had always intended to fully reimburse the Appellant for all the personal expenses claims he made throughout the year. The Judge also held that although the Respondent should have set up a better system to manage claims for the reimbursement of expenses, the Respondent genuinely believed that he was entitled to use the Expense Accounting Practice (see the Judgment at [252]−[262]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>As for whether there was a wilful breach of the Employment Contract, the Judge held that there was no intentionality or deliberateness in the commission of the breaches (see the Judgment at [263]−[265]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>Therefore, the Judge held that the Respondent was not entitled to rely on Cl 20 to terminate the Employment Contract. Consequently, the Respondent was entitled to one year’s salary under cl 14 of the Employment Contract, as well as three months’ salary for payment in lieu of notice (on the basis that a term for the payment of salary in lieu of notice could be implied): see the Judgment at [271] and [273]. The Judge also awarded one year’s bonus to the Respondent for the period between 1 March 2013 and 28 February 2014 because this bonus had accrued by the time he was terminated, but did not grant him judgment for his claim for bonus for the period between March 2014 and February 2015 (see the Judgment at [276]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The Appellant has two primary grounds of appeal. The first ground of appeal pertains to the Judge’s decision to allow the Respondent’s Alternative Claim for the one year’s salary and three months’ salary for payment in lieu of notice. According to the Appellant, the Judge erred both in law and fact by finding that the Respondent’s breaches of his contractual, general and fiduciary duties did not amount to serious misconduct or wilful breach under the Employment Contract. The Appellant advances the following points to support its first ground of appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Respondent’s misconduct had a material impact on the employment relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Respondent did not genuinely believe that he was entitled to utilise the Expense Accounting Practice nor did he intend to reimburse the Appellant for personal expense claims. In any event, the Respondent’s willingness or intention to repay the Appellant for the wrongfully claimed expenses could not negate the severity of the wrongdoing and was consequently immaterial to the question of whether there had been serious misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Respondent’s breach of fiduciary duties was significant and sufficient in and of itself to warrant summary dismissal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It was irrelevant that the Respondent had a past practice of utilising the Expense Accounting Practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>The Appellant’s second ground of appeal pertains to the Judge’s decision to only allow some of the Appellant’s counterclaim for the reimbursement of personal expenses. The Appellant submits that the Judge had erred in determining that the Appellant bore the burden of proving that the expenses were personal in nature. In this regard, the Appellant argues that pursuant to s 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Evidence Act”), it only has to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the expense claims were personal in nature and that, thereafter, the burden was on the Respondent to show that the claims had, in actual fact, been properly and reasonably incurred. The Appellant submits that it had shown such a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, so the burden was on the Respondent to justify the expenses but he had not done so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondent’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>In response to the Appellant’s first ground of appeal, the Respondent argues the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Judge was correct in finding that the Phosagro Group was largely indifferent to the Respondent’s management of the Appellant’s accounting practices and had therefore correctly found that the Respondent’s misconduct had little impact on the employer-employee relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Judge was correct in taking into account the fact that the Respondent did have the intention to reimburse the Appellant and that this supported the finding that there was no serious misconduct or wilful breach of the Respondent’s contractual obligations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Judge was correct in finding that a breach of fiduciary duty did not, in and of itself, warrant summary dismissal and that, on the facts, the Respondent’s breaches did not rise to the level as would justify summary dismissal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>As for the Appellant’s second ground of appeal, the Respondent argues that the Appellant had failed to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case to show that the expense claims were personal in nature. Additionally, even if the burden fell on the Respondent to show that these expense claims were not personal, the Respondent had successfully discharged this burden.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues before this court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>There are two main issues to be considered, which correspond to the two grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, whether the Respondent was guilty of serious misconduct and/or wilful breaches of the Employment Contract (“Issue 1”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, whether the Appellant is entitled to reimbursement of all of the alleged personal claims (“Issue 2”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>The focus – as we have, in fact, assumed from the outset of this judgment – appears to us to be a fairly conventional one. Put simply, what is crucial in the context of the present appeal is simply an issue of interpretation: whether there had been “serious misconduct” and/or “wilful breaches” of the Employment Contract within the meaning of Cl 20. If there had been such “serious misconduct” and/or “wilful breaches”, the Respondent would fail in his claim against the Appellant (see also the Judgment at [251]). The natural corollary of this is that should there <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been “serious misconduct” and/or “wilful breaches” of the Employment Contract within the meaning of Cl 20, the Respondent would succeed in his claim against the Appellant as there would have been no justification for the Appellant to summarily dismiss the Respondent. Indeed, this was the finding which was made by the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>However, we do note that there was a <span class="font-italic">prior</span> (arguably threshold) issue that was considered by the Judge and this was whether the Appellant could even invoke Cl 20 in the first place since it had only sought to rely on this particular clause in the Employment Contract in its 18 March 2014 Letter <span class="font-italic">after </span>it had <span class="font-italic">first </span>purported to terminate the Respondent’s employment via the 28 February 2014 letter. In this particular regard, the Judge had utilised the seminal English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Company v Ansell</span> (1888) 39 Ch D 339 (“<span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span>”) <span class="font-italic">by </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">analogy</span> in order to arrive at the conclusion that Cl 20 <span class="font-italic">could</span>, in fact, be relied upon by the Appellant. The legal principle in embodied in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> is well-established and was succinctly (and helpfully) summarised by the Judge as follows (see the Judgment at [164]−[165]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">164 <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> stands for the proposition that if an employer did not rely on his employee’s misconduct at the time of the dismissal because he did not know about it, he may subsequently invoke the said misconduct as <span class="font-italic">a defence</span> to a wrongful dismissal claim brought by the employee. This “transforms” what would have been a <span class="font-italic">termination in breach of contract</span> by the employer (hence giving rise to a claim for damages on the part of the employee), to a <span class="font-italic">lawful termination</span> pursuant to a repudiatory breach of the contract by the employee (removing any right on the employee’s part to claim for damages).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">165 <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> was more equivocal, however, about what would be the case if the employer knew about the misconduct but did not rely on it to dismiss the employee. In this regard, as seen from the passage quoted above, Cotton LJ seemed to have contemplated the possibility that estoppel may arise to preclude an employer from relying on those grounds of misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The principle in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> has been applied by our courts on several occasions (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Singapore High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Goh Kim Hai Edward v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 540 and <span class="font-italic">Cowie Edward Bruce v Berger International Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 739).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>At this juncture, it is important to emphasise that while the Judge referred to the legal principle in<span class="font-italic"> Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span>, he was not actually applying the principle <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directly</span> but was instead using it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">analogical</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ly</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>It can be readily seen why the Judge had to do so. The legal principle in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> was set out in the context of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the termination of an employment contract for </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">breach</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">at common law</span>. The facts of the present case are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">quite different</span> in so far as they concern the termination of an employment contract (by the Appellant) pursuant to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the express terms of the employment contract (</span><span class="font-weight-bold">viz</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the Employment Contract) itself</span>. It is our view, however, that the Judge was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">entirely correct</span> in drawing, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">analogy</span>, from the legal principle established in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing </span>and applying it in the context of a termination of an employment contract for breach at common law. In particular, we see <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no reason in principle why</span> the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">general proposition</span> embodied in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing </span>(albeit <span class="font-italic">at common law</span>) ought <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> to apply in a situation where the termination of the employment contract is effected <span class="font-italic">pursuant to the express term(s) of the employment contract itself.</span> Put simply, if an employer (here, the Appellant) has purported to terminate the employment contract pursuant to the terms of that contract without relying on any particular clause, we see no reason in principle and logic why the employer ought not to be permitted to <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> specify and rely upon a clause which justifies summary dismissal without compensation (in this case, Cl 20), even if the employer was not aware of its right to do so at the time of termination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>The Judge, however, went further and considered the effect of the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, which purported to modify the legal principle established over a century earlier in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span>. <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> involved a situation where the employer sought, <span class="font-italic">first</span>, to terminate the employment contract concerned <span class="font-italic">pursuant to an express term of the contract itself</span>, <span class="font-italic">but subsequently </span>discovered wrongdoing on the part of the employee which would have entitled it (the employer) to terminate the employment contract <span class="font-italic">for breach at common law instead</span>. The court in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh </span>held that the employer could <span class="font-italic">not </span>avail itself of the principle contained in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing </span>to terminate the contract for breach at common law instead. Central to its decision was the fact that any monetary remedy for termination under the former would, as noted both by the Judge and by the court in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> itself, result in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an accrued debt</span><span class="font-italic"> that is due to the employee concerned pursuant to the employment contract itself</span>, whereas any monetary remedy for termination under the latter would result in an award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">damages</span><span class="font-italic"> to the employee concerned. </span>The former remedy (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an accrued debt) is, of course, a <span class="font-italic">liquidated</span> amount, whereas the latter remedy (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an award of damages) involves an <span class="font-italic">unliquidated </span>amount (that is also subject to possible legal limitations such as causation, remoteness and mitigation). The Judge <span class="font-italic">agreed </span>with the legal principle established in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, <span class="font-italic">but </span>thought that it did not apply on the facts of the present case because there was <span class="font-italic">no “clash” between a situation involving an accrued debt as a monetary remedy and one involving damages as a monetary remedy.</span> Whilst we can understand why the Judge wanted to discuss <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> in order to distinguish it, it was, with respect, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not necessary </span>for the Judge <span class="font-italic">to endorse the legal principle laid down in </span><span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>. We will explain why this is so in a coda to our judgment (see [77]–[87] below) but it suffices to say for now that there are persuasive arguments both for as well as against the adoption of the legal principle laid down in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> and it would, in our view, be preferable for the courts to express a definitive or conclusive view only when it arises <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">directly</span> for decision in a future case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>Indeed, it is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">common ground</span> between the parties in the context of the present appeal that there are no legal difficulties surrounding the threshold question as to whether Cl 20 could even be relied upon in the first place.

In the absence of any guidance from the terms of the contract itself, there is a danger that any standard set by the court might be viewed as arbitrary. In our judgment, therefore, the most principled approach would be to look to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the common law principles</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">relating to discharge of breach</span> for guidance.

This was the approach adopted by counsel for the Appellant, Mr Paul Tan.

Because of their importance to the present appeal, we reproduce these paragraphs in full as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  Serious misconduct</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">252 The parties have not made submissions on how I should interpret the term “serious misconduct”. Unfortunately, the words do not speak with clarity for themselves – while a degree of gravity is clearly required, there is little else we can gather from the language of the contract itself. As such, I found it helpful to refer to the case law relating to employment contracts to see when, under common law, the courts have found that the employee’s misconduct was sufficiently grave or serious to constitute a repudiatory breach, justifying summary dismissal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">253   In <span class="font-italic">Cowie Edward Bruce</span> ([157] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [39], the High Court held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In each case, it is a matter of degree whether the act complained of is of the requisite gravity… it must be so serious that it strikes at the root of the contract of employment, that it destroys the confidence underlying such a contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judge then continued at [40] to state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The relevancy and effect of any misdeed complained of must, it seems to me, be judged by reference to its <span class="font-italic">effect on the employer-employee relationship</span>. It also seems to me that in judging the relevancy and effect of the acts complained of, account must be taken of the <span class="font-italic">habits and attitude of the employer at the relevant time</span>. They cannot be judged totally in a vacuum. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">254   This holding was affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Surteco Pte Ltd v Siebke Detlev Kurt</span> [2011] SGHC 74 at [12] as well as in <span class="font-italic">Aldabe Fermin</span> ([155] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [58]. Thus, it is clear that careful attention must be paid to the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> the breaches of duty has on the employer-employee relationship. Naturally, this would be affected in part by the employer’s attitude to the breaches in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">255   Based on the evidence, it appears that since the Phosagro Group took over the [Appellant], they have neither enquired about the existing accounting practices of the [Appellant], nor have they taken steps to implement new corporate governance and accounting regulations. The shareholders have shown little to no interest in regulating the way the finances of the [Appellant] are managed when it comes to issues like entertainment expenses or employment benefits.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">256   Moreover, it is clear that what put a strain on the employment relationship was the difference in views on bigger issues like the business direction the [Appellant’s] business should take, and the appointment of new directors onto the [Appellant’s] board. It does not appear that issues to do with the expenses of the directors or internal financial accountability were that significant to the [Respondent’s] employers [ie<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Appellant].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">257   Therefore, while the [Respondent’s] practice of claiming for personal expenses and, in all likelihood, not fully accounting for them at the end of the financial year, was a breach of his contractual and fiduciary duties, I am of the view that it did not constitute “serious misconduct” under cl 20 of the Employment Contract. I emphasise that I accept the [Respondent’s] evidence that he intended to fully reimburse the [Appellant] for all the personal expense claims he made throughout the year. Whether the system that he had put in place to do so was sufficiently rigorous, or whether his judgment of what were “personal” and “business” expenses was entirely accurate, are separate questions. In my view, the fact that the [Respondent] made some wrongful claims is not sufficient to justify a finding of “serious misconduct” such as to trigger the operation of cl 20. In my view, the [Respondent] genuinely believed that he was entitled to make the claims he did, and at trial, he expressed full willingness to account for whatever he may have mistakenly claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">258   When it comes to claims for expenses, it is understandable if employers and employees have a different interpretation of what the employee is entitled to claim and how the employee is to be reimbursed. This is especially so where there are no clear contractually incorporated or internal company regulations. As such, looking at the facts and circumstances as a whole, I do not find evidence of serious misconduct arising from the mere fact that some expenses claimed were wrongful.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">259   What is trickier is the fact that the [Respondent] carried over the same expense accounting practice he adopted at Asiafert (which he owned) in his management of the [Appellant’s] operations. As discussed earlier, the expense accounting practice, whilst convenient for the employee, was not in the best interest of the [Appellant]. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to consider this in the light of all the circumstances including the attitude of the [Appellant] (and the owners of the [Appellant]). Whilst the matter was not explored in depth, there was some evidence that Popov also submitted and accepted expense reimbursements during the year. Further, it does not appear that the new owners of the [Appellant] had taken any effort to establish regulations over company expenses and claims, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Monthly financial statements were provided to the Phosagro Group. These statements included the expense claims/payments. Even if the Phosagro Group did not know the individual details of the expense claims, they must have been aware that sizeable claims were being made.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">260   Whilst it has been held in <span class="font-italic">Sinclair v Neighbour</span> ([243] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that an employee who takes money from the cash till (leaving behind an IOU) commits a repudiatory breach of contract, each case must turn on its own facts and circumstances. In the latter case, the employee knew that the employer would not have given him permission to take cash from the till. This was a “knowing” breach that destroyed the relationship of trust between the employee and the employer and rendered the employment relationship untenable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">261   In the present case, I am satisfied that the [Respondent] believed that he was entitled to use the expense accounting practice he carried over from Asiafert and that the [Appellant] employer either knew or would not object to that method. Indeed, there is some evidence that supports the [Respondent’s] belief that the [Appellant] employer did not object and was broadly aware of expense claims. On balance, I am of the view that whilst the [Respondent] as the managing director could and should have set up a better system for expense claim reimbursement (and was therefore in breach of his duties as managing director), his breaches did not amount on the facts before me to serious misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">262   Whilst the [Appellant] has made much of the point that it was only after the counterclaim was filed that admission was made in respect of Category A expenses, it must be borne in mind that the [Respondent] was clearly caught by surprise when he received the letter of termination by e-mail on 28 February 2014. I elaborate more on this below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>As noted above, the Judge was correct in finding (at [252] of the Judgment) that for there to be “serious misconduct”, it must have been misconduct which is so serious as to constitute a “repudiatory breach”. That having been said, a point of the first importance in the context of the present appeal ought to be made: whilst the Judge sought to apply the relevant common law principles on repudiatory breach as set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> in the interpretation of the phrase “serious misconduct” in Cl 20, he did not, with respect, apply <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">all</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline"> the principles</span> laid down by the court in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>In <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, this court noted that there were four situations in which a breach of contract would amount to a repudiatory breach:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation 1</span>: where the contract clearly and unambiguously states that, in the event of a certain event or events occurring, the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the contract (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation 2</span>: where a party, by his words or conduct, simply renounces his contract inasmuch as he clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that he will not perform his contractual obligations at all (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation 3(a)</span>: the condition/warranty approach where the focus is on the nature of the term breached and, in particular, whether the intention of the parties to the contract was to designate that term as one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [97]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation 3(b)</span>: where the focus is on the nature and consequences of the breach; in particular, where the breach in question will give rise to an event which will deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [99]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>From the passages of the Judgment reproduced (see above at [50]), it appears that the Judge only focused on one aspect of the entire complement of legal principles set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>. In particular, the Judge was, in <span class="font-italic">substance</span>, referring to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(b)</span> in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete.</span> That this is the case is clear from the Judge’s reference to <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">nature and consequences</span><span class="font-italic"> of the breach </span>(see also,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the reference to the phrase “a degree of gravity” and the focus on the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of the breach at [252]–[254] of the Judgment). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However</span>, it is our view that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(a)</span> in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>would also be (potentially) applicable, as would all the other situations set out therein. That this is so is both logical as well as principled although we acknowledge that the usual case involving “serious misconduct” in the context of an employment contract will traditionally focus on the <span class="font-italic">nature and consequences or effects of the breach </span>(which will involve <span class="font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-italic">3(b) </span>in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>). Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Sinclair v Neighbour</span> [1967] 2 QB 279, a decision which had been relied upon by counsel for both parties, this appears to have been the reason why the English Court of Appeal found that summary dismissal was justified. There, an employee of a bookmaker took out £20 from the till without the employer’s permission, of which £15 was used for the purpose of placing a bet in another betting shop. The employee put an IOU into the till and repaid the money the money into the till the next day, his bet having turned out to be successful. The employee accepted that if he had asked the employer for permission to borrow money from the till for gambling, permission would have been refused. In finding that such misconduct warranted summary dismissal, Sellers LJ focused on the dishonesty of the employee and noted (at 287) that such conduct was of such a type which was “inconsistent, in a grave way” with the employee’s employment and Davies LJ highlighted (at 289) that such misconduct was “of such a grave and weighty character as to amount to a breach of the confidential relationship between master and servant, such as would render the servant unfit for continuance in the master’s employment”. The Judge characterised the case of <span class="font-italic">Sinclair</span> as being one where the misconduct “destroyed the relationship of trust between the employee and employer and rendered the employment relationship untenable” (see [260] of the Judgment). We agree with this description and, in our view, this shows quite clearly that <span class="font-italic">Sinclair</span> was a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(b)</span> type breach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>¸ the nature and consequences of the breach warranted termination). However, it is important to emphasise that this is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span> possible situation that might involve “serious misconduct” on the part of the employee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>Indeed (and on a more general level), it is our view that the legal principles set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> are of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">general </span><span class="font-italic">application</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all</span> <span class="font-italic">contracts</span>. It should be noted that the Judge himself referred to <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on numerous occasions in the Judgment</span>. Unfortunately, he did not refer to <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> at all in the paragraphs of the Judgment wherein he considered the present issue (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, whether there was “serious misconduct” by the Respondent within the meaning of Cl 20). As we have observed in the preceding paragraph, he did, however, refer (in <span class="font-italic">substance</span>) to one of the situations enunciated in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>(<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, <span class="font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-italic">3(b)</span>). We are nevertheless of the view that the concept of “serious misconduct” must be read as well as applied in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">context – in particular, in the context of the contract as a whole</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Looked at in this light, “serious misconduct” would include the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">breach </span><span class="font-italic">of</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">important</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">term(s)</span> <span class="font-italic">of the employment contract itself</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Such terms would be termed “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conditions</span>” pursuant to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(a)</span> in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete. </span>The breach of such terms would entitle the innocent party (here, the employer) in electing to treat the employment contract as discharged, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">regardless of</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">nature and consequences of the breach. </span>The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rationale</span> for adopting such an approach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, taking into account the breach of important terms of the Employment Contract as constituting “serious misconduct”) is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the same</span> as that for treating the breach of “condition” at common law as being a repudiatory breach – namely, if the term concerned was <span class="font-italic">intended</span> <span class="font-italic">by the parties</span> to be of such importance that <span class="font-italic">any</span> breach of it (<span class="font-italic">regardless of</span> the consequences) would <span class="font-italic">entitle</span> the innocent party to elect to treat the contract as discharged, then <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is no reason in principle why effect ought not to be given to that intention</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Indeed, and for the sake of completeness, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">apart from Situations </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(a) and 3(b)</span> of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, the breach concerned could be such that it amounts to a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">renunciation</span> of the contract by the employee – in which case the employer could elect to treat the contract as discharged pursuant to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">2</span> of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>.

These factors include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether a statute classifies a specific contractual term as a “condition”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the contractual term itself expressly states that it is a “condition”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the availability of a prior precedent; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the contract arises out of a mercantile transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This court, in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>, went on to note that although these factors were important, the ultimate focus was on <span class="font-italic">ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties themselves</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [174]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">174 The aforementioned factors are important. But, they are not exhaustive and, to use a familiar phrase (albeit in a somewhat different context), the categories of factors are not closed. The actual decision as to whether or not a contractual term is a condition would, indeed, depend very much on the particular factual matrix before the court. It also bears repeating that there is no magical formula. In the final analysis, the focus is on <span class="font-italic">ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties themselves by construing the actual contract itself (including the contractual term concerned) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole</span> (see also [161] above). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>Applying the principles set out in the preceding paragraph to Cl 3 (see above at [30]), which is the clause that the Respondent had breached, it is clear that the four factors mentioned therein are not applicable. However, that does <span class="font-italic">not </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">necessarily</span> mean that Cl 3 is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a “condition”. As this court was at pains to emphasise in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>(at [160]), “there is no magical formula (comprising a certain fixed number of factors or criteria) that would enable a court to ascertain whether or not a given contractual term is a condition”. What <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is</span> essential is to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ascertain the intention of the contracting parties (here, the Appellant and the Respondent) by construing the actual contract itself (including the contr</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">actual term concerned (here, Cl 3)) in the light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>What, then, are we to make of Cl 3? The Appellant had formerly belonged to the Respondent, who was now its employee and whose duty was to ensure that he did not take advantage of his insider knowledge to advance his own interests, but prioritised the welfare of the Appellant instead. This requirement is, in fact, embodied within both the letter as well as spirit of Cl 3 itself. It must be emphasised that the Respondent was in a unique position of being entrusted with a significant degree of authority, responsibility and independence in the conduct of the Appellant’s affairs. Indeed, this is made abundantly clear from the fact that the Respondent had the sole authority to reimburse <span class="font-italic">both</span> himself and Popov for the expenses which they had incurred. In our view, it is precisely because the Respondent had previously been the sole shareholder and director of Asiafert that he was accorded such autonomy in the running of the Appellant. With such trust being reposed in the Respondent, one would expect that a clause (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>¸ Cl 3) which places the obligation on the Respondent to “well and faithfully serve the [Appellant] in all respects and use his best endeavours to promote the interest of the [Appellant]” would have been intended by the parties to be of the utmost importance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>It is our view, therefore, that Cl 3 is, in law, a “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">condition</span>” within the meaning of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(a)</span> in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> and, given that there has been a clear breach of that particular clause, that breach <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">does</span> constitute <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“serious misconduct”</span> within the scope of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">C</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">l 20</span>. This finding would be sufficient to allow the appeal with respect to Issue 1. However, for completeness, and since it was the focus of the Judge’s analysis in the court below, we consider (briefly) whether the Respondent’s conduct also fell within the purview of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Situation </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">3(b)</span> in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>; if it did, then that would constitute <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an additional reason </span>to allow the appeal with respect to Issue 1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>In so far as <span class="font-italic">guidance </span>with respect to Situation 3<span class="font-italic">(b)</span> is concerned, the following observations by this court in <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Deuter Sports GmbH </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 883 (at [62] and [64]) might be usefully noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 In our view, the focus must be on the formulation laid down by Diplock LJ in <span class="font-italic">Hongkong</span><span class="font-italic"> Fir</span> ([39] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) itself: The innocent party must establish deprivation of “substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract that he should obtain as the consideration” (see <span class="font-italic">Hongkong Fir</span> (at 66)) for the performance of the innocent party’s own obligations. At bottom, the focus is on determining <span class="font-italic">what exactly constituted the benefit</span> that it was intended the innocent party should obtain from the contract (which, looked at in one sense, is a question of construction, but not in the sense utilised in the context of ascertaining whether a term is a condition pursuant to the condition-warranty approach (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> also <span class="font-italic">Koompahtoo</span> (especially at [55], reproduced below at [63]) as well as Turner on <span class="font-italic">Hongkong</span><span class="font-italic"> Fir</span> ([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 435–436, although Turner was probably referring to construction in the latter sense just mentioned)), <span class="font-italic">and then</span> examining very closely the <span class="font-italic">actual consequences</span> which have occurred as a result of the breach <span class="font-italic">at the time at which the innocent party purported to terminate the contract in order to ascertain whether the innocent party was, in fact, deprived of substantially the whole benefit of the contract that it was intended that the innocent party should obtain</span>. We would emphasise here that regard should be had only to the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> consequences and events resulting from the breach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 There is, in fact, no magical formula that would enable a court to ascertain whether or not the breach is sufficiently serious so as to permit the innocent party to terminate the contract pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">Hongkong Fir</span> approach. There are certainly a number of general formulations (some of which have been set out above at [61]). However, as we have noted above (at [61]), these general formulations are, in fact, similar in substance. More specifically, there are also particular factors which can be found in the case law (such as those set out by the majority of the court in <span class="font-italic">Koompahtoo</span> (at [54], reproduced in the preceding paragraph). However, as we have also noted above (at [63]), they are by no means either exhaustive or conclusive. In the final analysis, the actual decision as to whether or not the breach concerned is sufficiently serious so as to permit the innocent party to terminate the contract is largely dependent on the precise factual matrix of the case itself (see also <span class="font-italic">Breach of Contract</span> at para 655 and Ewan McKendrick, <span class="font-italic">Contract Law – Text, Cases, and Materials</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2008) at p 795).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>As is the case with Situation 3(a) of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, there is no magic formula as such which would be determinative of the case concerned. Much would depend upon the precise facts and circumstances of the case itself. In so far as the present case is concerned, could it be said that the Respondent’s conduct in breach of Cl 3 was such that it deprived the Appellant of substantially the whole benefit of the Employment Contract which it was intended that it (the Appellant) should have? In our view, it cannot. Notwithstanding the Respondent’s breach of Cl 3 through the utilisation of the Expense Accounting Practice, this particular breach did <span class="font-italic">not</span> detract from the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">overall</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>contributions of the Respondent to the Appellant itself, such that the Appellant could be said to have been deprived of substantially the whole benefit of the Employment Contract. However, as we have already noted, even though Situation 3(b) is not applicable to the present case, Situation 3<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(a)</span> is applicable, and this would suffice for us to find that there had been “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">serious misconduct</span>” within the meaning of Cl 20.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Were there “wilful breaches” of the Employment Contract by the Respondent under Cl 20?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>We turn now to the issue of whether there were “wilful breaches” of the Employment Contract by the Respondent under Cl 20. Given our finding that there had been “serious misconduct” by the Respondent under that same clause (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Cl 20), it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary for us to consider this particular issue. However, we will nevertheless proceed to consider this issue for the sake of completeness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>The decision of the Judge with regard to the issue as to whether there had been “wilful breaches” by the Respondent which justified the termination of his employment by the Appellant are contained at [263]−[265] of the Judgment, which we reproduce in full as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Wilful breaches of the Employment Contract</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">263   The parties did not make submissions on how “wilful” should be interpreted. Given that no authorities were submitted to me for my consideration, I shall take the plain meaning of the word, and proceed on the basis that a “wilful” breach is one that requires some form of intentionality or deliberateness in the commission of the breach. In this regard, I was guided by the High Court’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Xuyi Building Engineering Co v Li Aidong</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1041 at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The provision refers to ‘any wilful breach’ of a condition of the contract of service. Counsel for the employees equated that to a fundamental breach. I do not think that was apt, and I would consider a wilful material breach would suffice … A considered decision not to pay an employee in accordance to those provisions of the Act is a wilful material breach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">264   In this regard, I find that the [Appellant] is not guilty of a “wilful breach or non-observance” of the stipulations in the Employment Contract. While the [Respondent] may have breached cl 3 and several implied duties in the Employment Contract, I find that he did not do so wilfully. On the contrary, as noted already, I find that the [Respondent] genuinely believed that he was entitled to claim his entire credit card bill without differentiating business from personal expense out of convenience, so long as he reimbursed the [Appellant] at the end of the financial year. I also accept that he would have been willing to reimburse the [Appellant] for expenses that were personal in nature and outside of his entitlement. In this regard, the [Respondent’s] admissions to the Category A claims cement this finding of fact. It is therefore not enough to show that the [Respondent] knew that some of his expense claims may have been personal or may fall outside what he was entitled to claim. It is necessary to go further and establish that the [Respondent] knew that he was not entitled to make the expense claims under the system established at Asiafert.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">265   The [Appellant] submits that the [Plaintiff] failed to admit to any of his personal expenses after his termination, even when requested to in the 18 March 2014 Letter, and only did so when he filed his defence to the counterclaim. However, as indicated earlier, I accept the [Respondent’s] explanation that he was distraught and sought legal advice after receiving the 18 March 2014 Letter. I therefore do not think it detracts from my overall finding of fact that the [Respondent] never intentionally tried to cheat the [Appellant] of money, and never intentionally or deliberately breached the terms of his Employment Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>We agree with the reasoning of the Judge as set out in the preceding paragraph. Central to his conclusion that the Respondent had not committed “wilful breaches” of the Employment Contract was his finding that the Respondent had <span class="font-italic">genuinely believed</span> that what he had done was correct (notwithstanding the fact that they constituted breaches of contract). We agree with this finding, and it follows, therefore, that the breaches were <span class="font-italic">not</span> “<span class="font-italic">wilful</span>” within the meaning of Cl 20.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>To summarise, although we have found that the Respondent had not been guilty of “wilful breaches” under Cl 20, we have nevertheless found that he had (contrary to the Judge’s finding) been guilty of “serious misconduct” within the meaning of that same clause. We therefore allow the appeal with regard to Issue 1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>We note at the outset that the Judge dealt with this particular issue in great detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>The Appellant’s main argument in this regard is that because it is especially within the Respondent’s knowledge whether the expenses are personal in nature, pursuant to s 108 of the Evidence Act (“Section 108”), the burden should be on him to prove otherwise. Section 108 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>At this juncture, it warrants mention that Section 108 is a provision which should only be invoked in “very limited circumstances” since “[w]idely construed and lifted out of its context, it will reverse the burden of proof of the essential ingredients of the [claimant’s] case which by section 103 [of the Evidence Act] is cast on the [claimant]” (see Chen Siyuan and Lionel Leo, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Evidence in Singapore</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Evidence in Singapore</span>”) at paras 3.055−3.056, citing (at para 3.055) Tan Yock Lin, “The Incomprehensible Burden of Proof” [1994] SJLS 29 at 38). Section 103 of the Evidence Act provides that the party who desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability which is dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts has the burden of proving the existence of the asserted facts. Put simply, Section 108 is the exception to the rule and may be successfully invoked “only in very extreme scenarios” (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Evidence in Singapore</span> at para 3.064). That this is so was made clear in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 24, albeit in the context of a criminal matter, where V K Rajah J (as he then was) noted as follows (at [95]–[96]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">95 … Section 108 of the EA cannot relieve the Prosecution from its burden of proof.

It does not have the effect of imposing on an accused the onus of proving that no offence was committed even if the accused is the sole witness.

When any fact is within special knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. The word ‘especially’ stresses that. It means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>That having been said, the Respondent does not dispute that Section 108 is applicable in the present case. His main contention is instead that the Appellant has failed to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that <span class="font-italic">each and every</span> expense raised in the counterclaim is personal in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>The Appellant, accepts (correctly, in our view) that a mere allegation that the expenses are personal will not suffice to trigger the application of Section 108; instead, it accepts that it must first establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the expenses were personal in nature before Section 108 may be invoked (see <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [221]). According to the Appellant, the following three facts – (a) the Expense Accounting Practice was improper (as found by the Judge); (b) the Appellant was able to prove that certain expense claims were indeed unauthorised; and (c) the Respondent admitted that certain claims were personal (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Category A expenses) – cumulatively suffice to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that <span class="font-italic">all</span> the expense claims which are the subject of the counterclaim were personal in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>In our view, the fact that the Expense Accounting Practice was improper in that it amounted to a breach of the Respondent’s contractual duties to act in the best interest of the Appellant, does <span class="font-italic">not</span> – in and of itself – suffice to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the expenses in the counterclaim were personal in nature. If that were the case, the Appellant would essentially be able to allege that <span class="font-italic">every single expense</span> in the Respondent’s credit card statements, even those which are not subject of the counterclaim, is <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie </span>a personal expense. This cannot be correct. The concept of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” was explained by Wee Chong Jin CJ in the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in <span class="font-italic">Gan Soo Swee</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Ramoo </span>[1968–1970] SLR(R) 324 (at [21]), where he clarified that in order to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case, a plaintiff had to “prove facts from which in the absence of an explanation liability could properly be inferred”. This definition was cited with approval by Chan Sek Keong CJ in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario </span>[2012] 3 SLR 440 at [7]. In our view, the mere production of the Respondent’s credit card statements, coupled with the finding that the Expense Accounting Practice was generally improper, cannot suffice to lead to the inference that all payments made under the Respondent’s credit card were personal in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>Secondly, it is not appropriate, in our view, for the Appellant to assert that because it was able to prove at trial that some expenses were personal in nature, it had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the expenses raised in the counterclaim were personal. The burden on the Appellant to show a <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie</span> case that the expenses were personal in nature was a burden which fell on it at trial. It is therefore illogical, with respect, for the Appellant to suggest that because the Judge had found, <span class="font-italic">after </span><span class="font-italic">the trial</span>, that <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the expense claims were personal, this finding can now be relied upon to discharge its burden of proving a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that <span class="font-italic">every single one</span> of the expenses was personal in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>It is significant, in our view, that the Appellant did not attempt to call any representative of Tricor to give evidence as to whether the expense claims which formed the subject matter of the counterclaim were unauthorised. Since the Expense Accounting Practice involved Tricor identifying which of the expense claims were personal in nature, it must surely have had some criteria for identifying such claims. Therefore, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case could have been established if the Appellant had procured a representative from Tricor to give evidence that, based on the criteria it applied, these expense claims were of a personal nature. The Appellant has sought to rely on the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission decision of <span class="font-italic">Boniface v SMEC Services Pty Limited and anor</span> [2007] NSWIRComm 301<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Boniface</span>”) to argue that the burden should be on the Respondent to explain the nature of all the expenses raised in the counterclaim. In <span class="font-italic">Boniface</span>, the Commission held (at [206]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where a director seeks reimbursement of monies said to be expended on behalf of a company, it is incumbent upon the director to ensure that proper and appropriate records are available which will allow the company and its auditors to identify the expense as being one that is properly payable by the company. A failure to recognise this fundamental obligation constitutes a breach of a director’s fiduciary duty …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It should be noted, however, that, contrary to the Appellant’s submissions, the above observations made by the Commission did not pertain to the issue of who bore the burden of proving the nature of the expenses. Rather, the issue before the Commission was whether the applicant in that case (the Chief Executive Officer of his company) was guilty of misconduct. The Commission relied on the above to conclude that because the director did not have such proper and appropriate records, he had breached his fiduciary duty to the employer. In fact, in <span class="font-italic">Boniface</span>, an audit committee had analysed the various expense claims made by the director and had flagged these expenses as being unauthorised. This is a significant distinguishing factor from the present case. As noted above, if the Appellant had called on a representative of Tricor to give evidence that, based on his analysis, these were expenses that were personal in nature, it would be legitimate for the Appellant to argue that the burden had shifted to the Respondent to show otherwise. However, in the light of the Appellant’s failure to do so, we do not think that it can said that the Appellant has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that all the expense claims raised in the counterclaim were personal in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span>In the circumstances, we affirm the decision of the Judge with regard to Issue 2.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal with regard to Issue 1, but dismiss the appeal with regard to Issue 2.

In <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, the respondent company had summarily terminated the appellant’s appointment as managing director of the company pursuant to an express term of his service agreement and agreed to give the appellant six months’ pay in lieu of notice. Subsequently, it came to the company’s attention that the appellant had been guilty of misconduct pre-termination and the company therefore refused to give him the six months’ pay which they had initially said they would. This led the appellant to commence action against the company. In its defence, the company argued that the appellant had been guilty of gross misconduct as he had wrongly procured a payment of £10,000 to his personal pension provider even though he knew he was not entitled to do so. In doing so, the company submitted, the appellant had committed a repudiatory breach of contract which would have entitled the company to summarily terminate the appellant’s employment at common law. Mummery LJ, who delivered the leading judgment, rejected the company’s defence and distinguished <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> on the basis that it <span class="font-italic">did not</span> concern a case where the employee had been terminated pursuant to a clause of the employment contract. We set out the reasoning of the Mummery LJ in detail (at [36]–[39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 However, I am persuaded by Mr Catherwood that the correct legal analysis of this case, on the basis of the pleaded case and the arguments at trial, turns on the effect of the decision of the Company in the letter of 12 March 2010. There is no escaping the fact that, on that date, the Company purported to exercise its contractual power under clause 11.5 to terminate the service agreement without notice, but with pay in lieu, and the Company agreed to pay it. A debt by the Company to Mr Cavenagh thereby accrued.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Having chosen to terminate the service agreement in that way, the Company was not entitled to resile from the contractual consequences of its choice by later following the different common law route of accepting repudiation by relying, after the termination event, on an earlier act of misconduct by Mr Cavenagh<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>of which it was unaware on 12 March 2010.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 The contract itself did not contain any provision releasing the Company from its contractual obligation to pay the debt that arose from the exercise of the contractual power on 12 March. The contractual right to payment in lieu having accrued, Mr Cavenagh was entitled to payment of it in the same way as other sums that had accrued due at the date of dismissal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 The general law did not release the Company from its contractual liability on the only ground relied on by the Company in this action, namely that it acquired knowledge after it had terminated the contract under clause 11.5, which would have entitled it to terminate it outside that clause and summarily without liability for pay in lieu. [<span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span>] did not go as far as to say that after-discovered misconduct provided an employer with a defence to an action for payment of an accrued debt. The principle for which that case stands is that an employer can defend a claim for damages for wrongful dismissal by using at trial, in its defence of justification, evidence of misconduct by the employee that was not known to the employer at the time of dismissal. In this case the Company was not seeking in the proceedings to justify its dismissal of Mr Cavenagh. There was no dispute that his appointment was terminated summarily on 12 March 2010 and in a fashion that was lawful: it was not a prima facie wrongful act, which the Company had to justify by evidence of breach of duty. The consequence of the lawful termination was that the Company became contractually bound to Mr Cavenagh for pay in lieu. All of that happened before the Company knew of, or was in a position to accept, Mr Cavenagh’s prior repudiatory breach. The lawful termination had already triggered the liability for pay in lieu, which was, as a matter of legal analysis, quite a different situation than that facing the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>We note that in <span class="font-italic">Shepherd Andrew v BIL International Ltd </span>[2003] SGHC 145, a decision which pre-dated <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, the Singapore High Court had similarly held that where an employee had been summarily dismissed pursuant to a term of the employment contract which would entitle the employee to contractually stipulated severance payments, the employer cannot subsequently rely on the employee’s repudiatory breaches as a defence to the latter’s claim for severance payments under the contract. The court, however, did not provide a detailed explanation for so finding and simply noted (at [122]) that the principle in<span class="font-italic"> Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span> “ha[d] no application to this case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>In so far as <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> draws a distinction between termination pursuant to a <span class="font-italic">term of the contract itself</span> on the one hand and termination at common law on the other, we find that distinction to be both logical as well as principled. Indeed (and as already observed above at [44]), any monetary remedy for termination under the former will, as noted both by the Judge and <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> itself, result in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an accrued debt</span><span class="font-italic"> that is due to the employee concerned pursuant to the employment contract itself</span>, whereas any monetary remedy for termination under the latter will result in an award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">damages</span><span class="font-italic"> to the employee concerned. </span>The former remedy (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an accrued debt) is, of course, a <span class="font-italic">liquidated</span> amount, whereas the latter remedy (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, an award of damages) involves an <span class="font-italic">unliquidated </span>amount (that is also subject to possible legal limitations such as causation, remoteness and mitigation).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Indeed, this same distinction (between an accrued debt and damages arising from a breach of contract) underlies (albeit in a different context) the legal principle embodied in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">White and Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor </span>[1962] AC 413 (“<span class="font-italic">White and Carter</span>”). In particular, it was held (albeit by a bare majority of three to two) in <span class="font-italic">White and Carter</span> that, where there is a claim for a fixed sum (as opposed to a claim for unliquidated damages), there is no duty on the part of the plaintiff to mitigate its loss. However, this could possibly lead to unjust and unfair (and even bizarre) results. This perhaps explains the qualification by Lord Reid in that decision (at 430−431) in which the learned Law Lord (who was in the majority) observed, in essence, that the plaintiff could not refuse to mitigate its loss and insist on continuing with its performance in order to claim the fixed sum agreed upon by the parties where (a) it (the plaintiff) required the co-operation of the other party (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the defendant) or (b) it (the plaintiff) had no legitimate interest in continuing such performance. The second qualification, in particular, is problematic and has (in addition to a series of decisions over the last half a century or so) just been canvassed in a recent decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MSC Mediterranean Shipping Council SA v Cottonex Anstalt </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 789. However, as the legal principle in <span class="font-italic">White and Carter </span>does not arise in the present appeal and is only relevant by way of analogy, the difficulties that arise from this case need not detain us here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>Returning to the issue raised in the present appeal (and, in particular, by reference to the distinction drawn in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>), whilst we have already observed that the distinction between termination pursuant to a term of the employment contract and termination as a result of a breach by the employee is a logical and principled one in law to draw, the further legal consequences that are set out in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh </span>itself may not, with respect, be as clear as the court makes them out to be<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">To recapitulate, in the former situation (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">viz</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, where termination is effected pursuant to a term in the employment contract and not owing to misconduct), even if the employer is subsequently made aware that the employee had misconducted himself and was liable to be summarily dismissed by the employer, the employer will not be able rely upon this misconduct as a defence to any payment which may have accrued upon the employer’s termination of the employee. Such a defence would only be available to the employer if he had initially terminated the employee without reliance on any term in the contract. In such a situation, the employer would be able to rely on the subsequently revealed misconduct to transform what would have been a termination in breach of contract by the employer to a lawful termination pursuant to a repudiatory breach of the contract by the employee. That was precisely the situation in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Boston Deep Sea Fishing</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Put simply, the court in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Cavenagh </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">confined the legal principle in </span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Boston Deep Sea Fishing </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">to its facts</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">viz</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, a situation in which the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">original</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">termination of employment was based on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a breach at common law</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

In particular, if the focus is on whether the employer is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">justified</span> in terminating the employee’s employment, why should it (the employer) not be afforded the opportunity to rely on new facts that <span class="font-italic">justify</span> the said termination (<span class="font-italic">albeit on a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">different</span> <span class="font-italic">legal basis</span>)? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>At this juncture, we note, however, that the court in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> did suggest an approach that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">balances</span> the tension between doing justice to <span class="font-italic">both</span> employer <span class="font-italic">and</span> employee alike. Whilst the employer might, under the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, be precluded from relying on new facts to justify the termination of the employee’s employment for breach at common law if it has already purported to terminate that employment pursuant to a term of the employment contract itself, <span class="font-italic">this does </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">necessarily </span><span class="font-italic">mean that the employee will get away with his or her breach of contract (especially since it was a breach so serious that it would have justified the employer in terminating his or her employment had the employer been aware of those facts in the first place)</span>. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> had intimated (at [19]), the company could have brought a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">counterclaim</span> for damages on the basis that the employee had breached his duty to the company by failing to inform it of his gross misconduct, either at the time he committed it or at any time before he was dismissed. The court further suggested that it might have been open to the company to argue that the agreement to make the payment in lieu of notice was void or voidable by reason of a vitiating unilateral mistake on the part of the company which was known to the employee. These issues, however, did not fall to be determined by the court since they did not form part of the company’s pleaded case. We pause to observe, parenthetically, that this balance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">becomes especially important</span> in light of the fact that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">even a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">breach of a term of the employment contract itself could embody (or at least overlap with) what is, in substance, a repudiatory breach at common law</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>Returning to <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span>, there are reasons to commend the decision in that case if we bear the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">balance </span>established in that case in mind, although it is also important to note that we do not need to decide this point definitively in the context of the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>Notwithstanding the reasons that appear to weigh in favour of endorsement of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh </span>(briefly set out in the preceding paragraphs), there are, however, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">practical </span><span class="font-italic">difficulties </span>that point in the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">opposite</span> direction. If, for example, an employer terminates the employee’s contract of employment pursuant to an express term of the said contract (and pays a contractually promised sum in severance) and later discovers that the employee had committed a repudiatory breach at common law which would have entitled the employer to terminate the employee’s employment (pursuant to one or more of the situations set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>), <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh </span>would permit the employer to mount a claim on the basis of the employee having breached his fiduciary duty to the company by failing to disclose his misconduct. However, it should be noted that such a duty may not apply to an employee who is not in a fiduciary position. In that case, the only breach that the employer would be able to rely upon would be the <span class="font-italic">original</span> misconduct of the employee. However, there might be a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">disconnect</span> between <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">sum which the employee would have (wrongfully) received in severance </span><span class="font-italic">and what the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">employer would be able to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">recover in its claim for the employee’s breach of contract</span>, thus resulting in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unfairness</span>. Utilising the facts of the present case as the basis for a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">hypothetical </span><span class="font-italic">illustration</span>, if the employer had terminated the employee’s employment pursuant to cll 2 and 14 of the Employment Contract, the employer would have to provide severance payments to the employee pursuant to the aforementioned terms. If the employee had been guilty of a repudiatory breach of the Employment Contract at common law by using the employer’s accounts to pay for his personal expenses, and <span class="font-italic">assuming that the employee was not a fiduciary</span>, the employer could mount a claim against the employee and what the former could claim against the latter would be the repayment by the employee to the employer of personal expenses (assuming that those expenses could be proved by sufficient evidence adduced by the employer). <span class="font-italic">However</span>, if the amount of the severance payments was <span class="font-italic">larger than</span> the amount of personal expenses claimable by the employer, the <span class="font-italic">overall </span>result might be less than satisfactory. Whilst the employer could attempt to claw back the severance payments made to the employee, this could well be a very difficult task since it could be difficult to establish that the employee’s repudiatory breach of contract at common law had <span class="font-italic">caused</span> the employer to make the said severance payments. As a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">practical</span> way around the difficulty just stated, practitioners who have commented on <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> have suggested that, in these circumstances, employers should word their respective employment contracts in a way that makes it a condition of the payment of any amounts pursuant to the express term(s) of the employment contract concerned that the employee in question has not been guilty of any serious misconduct and that if it transpires that the employee had in fact been guilty of any such breach(es), any severance payment which had already been made would be repayable on demand. Whilst this does furnish a possible solution to the difficulty at hand, the question arises as to whether the onus ought to be placed upon employers to word their respective employment contracts in the manner just mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>It is clear, therefore, that <span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span> raises a number of difficult issues that require resolution. As already mentioned more than once, this court will deliver a definitive ruling upon these issues only when the issues arise directly for its consideration in a future case.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong           Judith Prakash   Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal            Judge of Appeal  Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Beng Hwee Paul and Arthi Anbalagan (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the appellant;<br/>Eugene Thuraisingam, Jerrie Tan Qiu Lin and Damien Yeo (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
