Such efforts may well involve others, whose degree of complicity and knowledge will vary. The effective interdiction of such a fraudulent scheme necessarily requires proceedings not only against the principal wrongdoer but also against those who have assisted in the scheme and who may continue to hold assets or funds into which the defrauded organisation may seek to trace. Funds may well flow across borders, so as to be better concealed. For this reason, proceedings brought by that organisation are likely to happen in more than one jurisdiction, and against multiple persons. The causes of action invoked in a common law jurisdiction would typically include breach of fiduciary duty, dishonest assistance in those breaches and knowing receipt of the proceeds of such breaches, as well as the tort of unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 When freezing orders are sought in Singapore in support of proceedings which are brought elsewhere, additional parties may be added. The court must scrutinise whether there exists a good arguable case against such additional parties, or alternatively whether they are properly joined as entities holding assets of the alleged wrongdoer into which the plaintiff seeks to trace. While a plaintiff may consider it necessary to cast the net wide, the court must guard against hapless bycatch. The effect of a freezing order is potentially crippling, with rippling reputational impact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 26 February 2021, in <span class="font-italic">The Agency for Policy Coordination on State </span><span class="font-italic">Property of Mongolia and others v Batbold Sukhbaatar and others </span>[2021] SGHC 50, I ruled that the solicitors on record for the plaintiffs had authority to act. Thus, the summons filed on 18 December 2020 by the fifth and sixth defendants for discharge of the freezing order granted against them on 27 November 2020 proceeded for hearing before me on 3 March 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the hearing, the main argument pressed by counsel for the fifth and sixth defendants was that no good arguable case had been established against the fifth defendant, and so the injunction should be discharged against both him and the company in which he holds shares, the sixth defendant. In addition, in his written submissions, he challenged the claim that there was any real risk of dissipation and asserted that there had been material non-disclosure that tainted the original grant of the freezing order. He also contended that the net had been cast so as to include his clients only in order to construct jurisdiction over the other defendants. He argued that this was a collateral purpose that rendered the proceedings against the fifth and sixth defendants an abuse of process. Lastly, he contended that the undertaking as to damages was illusory. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The first plaintiff is an agency of the Government of Mongolia, the Agency for Policy Coordination on State Property (the “Agency”). The Agency owns 100% of Erdenet Mining Corporation LLC (“Erdenet Mining”), a company incorporated in Mongolia, which is the second plaintiff. The second plaintiff holds the Mongolian State’s interest in the Erdenet copper mine. The third plaintiff, Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC, is also owned by the Government of Mongolia. It holds the Mongolian State’s interest in a copper and gold mine, known as Oyu Tolgoi.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiffs’ written submissions dated 19 January 2021 at paras 27–28, 57.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Only one of the three involved the fifth defendant, but the plaintiffs say that the apparent overall pattern strengthens the inferences against the fifth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The other defendants have consented, without admission of liability, to the continuance of the freezing orders against them. Thus, at this stage, they have chosen not to contest that there is a good arguable case against them. I have reviewed the evidence showing the pattern of conduct involving the three companies trading with Erdenet Mining, and accept that there is much to answer and explain. However, if the first defendant is allegedly at the centre of the conspiracy, and the second and third defendants in his inner circle, the fifth defendant is only in an outer circle of potential responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence implicating the fifth defendant to establish a good arguable case. It may indeed turn out that his involvement has been entirely innocent, but at this stage of proceedings the plaintiffs have crossed the threshold of a case that is more than barely capable of serious argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The sixth defendant is in a different position. It appears to be dormant, having initially been set up for what appears to have been an unrelated and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> business purpose. There is no evidence of its having been used to hold or conceal assets deriving from the Erdenet Mine Scheme. There is insufficient evidence to find a good arguable case that it is a proxy of the second and fifth defendants in connection with the claim of secret profits against the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Real risk of dissipation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The plaintiffs essentially rely on the existence of a good arguable case that the fifth defendant is involved in the Erdenet Mine Scheme, and so potentially liable in conspiracy or dishonest assistance. They refer to the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> for the proposition<span class="font-italic"> </span>that one may legitimately infer a real risk of dissipation from a good arguable case of dishonesty on the merits where the alleged dishonesty is of such a nature that it has a real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation. The plaintiffs do not appear to have any evidence other than the inference one might draw from the alleged dishonesty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> gave guidance at [94] concerning the relationship between an allegation of dishonesty and the existence of a real risk of dissipation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">94 In our judgment, a well-substantiated allegation that a defendant has acted dishonestly can and often <span class="font-italic">will</span>, as we have said, be relevant to whether there is a real risk that the defendant may dissipate his assets. But, we reiterate that in each case, it is incumbent on the court to examine the precise nature of the dishonesty alleged and the strength of the evidence relied on in support of the allegation, keeping fully in mind that the proceedings are only at an interlocutory stage … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An allegation of dishonesty does not in itself form a substitute for an examination of the degree of risk of dissipation unless</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> … that allegation is of a nature or characteristic that sufficiently bears upon the risk of dissipation.</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is therefore critical to assess what inferences should be drawn from the nature and extent of the dishonest conduct alleged against the fifth defendant. In addition, the strength of the case against him must also be assessed. I start with the nature and extent of his alleged dishonesty. While it is true that the scheme considered as a whole appears elaborate, with multiple companies incorporated in numerous jurisdictions for the purpose of concealment, the fifth defendant’s role has been simple and limited. He is not at the core of the alleged conspiracy but at its periphery. It is not his identity that has been concealed through the use of corporate vehicles. There is also no evidence that the alleged secret profits passed through either the fifth or sixth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Turning to the strength of the case against him, I would assess it at this stage as meeting the test of a good arguable case and not much more than that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Given the limited role of the fifth defendant, and the moderate strength of the case against him, the fact that the causes of action, if successful, entail dishonesty on his part does not in itself compel an inference that there is a real risk of dissipation of assets by him, if the injunction does not continue against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 There is another factor to consider, which is the behaviour of a defendant upon becoming subject to a freezing order. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [104], it is only in limited circumstances that arguments concerning the adequacy of the information provided under the ancillary disclosure orders will strengthen the inference of a real risk of dissipation. On the other side of the coin, candour and cooperation may help dispel concerns about a defendant’s future conduct. In this case, the fifth defendant appears to have been candid and thorough in his disclosures, both for himself and for the sixth defendant. This swells the court’s confidence that no real risk of dissipation should be inferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is also important to bring into consideration the evidence given by the fifth defendant of his ties and roots in Singapore. This evidence was not substantively challenged by the plaintiffs. There is no suggestion that he will uproot from Singapore. Overall, the overwhelming likelihood is that he plans to stand his ground and contest the case against him. The court should be circumspect before continuing the strong restrictions of a freezing order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As for the sixth defendant, there is likewise no evidence of risk of dissipation beyond the alleged dishonesty of the fifth defendant. While the sixth defendant is owned by both the second and the fifth defendant, there is no evidence of its having held or concealed assets traceable to the Erdenet Mine Scheme. Indeed, it currently seems to have very little money in its bank account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In all the circumstances, I decline to hold that there is a real risk of dissipation on the part of the fifth and sixth defendants. Accordingly, I will discharge the freezing orders made against them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other matters raised</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For completeness, I add that I do not accept that there was any material non-disclosure on the part of the plaintiffs in obtaining the initial freezing order <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span>. There were three principal non-disclosures relied upon. The first concerned the nature and signatories of the contracts between Cliveden and Erdenet Mining.

</div> While in principle, post-hearing developments that undermine the basis on which an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>order is given should be drawn to the court’s attention, at least while the proceedings remain on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>basis, I do not accept that the developments in the New York proceedings were sufficiently material or unequivocal so as to necessitate their being raised to the court. In my view, they have no bearing on whether the freezing order should be continued in Singapore. Thirdly, the fifth defendant contended that the plaintiffs had misleadingly labelled the fifth defendant as a proxy of the first defendant and a “key conspirator” for the purpose of the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> hearing, without sufficiently drawing to the court’s attention that the fifth defendant was not even mentioned in pleadings for the Hong Kong proceedings or in the Mongolian Claim.

</div> Again, this does not rise to the level of a culpable or material non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I also do not accept that the plaintiffs have acted in abuse of process. The fifth defendant has contended that he and the sixth defendant were sued for the collateral purpose of founding jurisdiction against the non-Singapore entities, by virtue of their being necessary and proper parties.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-1bc495ac-ab8c-4d86-8857-4a8ecbe5ab70" data-toggle="modal" type="button">22</button></sup>

</div>
</div> There was no direct evidence of any such collateral purpose, and the argument depended on drawing an inference from the asserted weakness of the claim against the fifth defendant. Given my finding that the plaintiffs do have a good arguable case against the fifth defendant, I would not draw any such inference. The plaintiffs were entitled in good faith to commence proceedings against the fifth defendant in Singapore; there was no abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lastly, had I not decided as I have on the question of risk of dissipation, I would have ordered fortification of the undertaking in the sum sought. This would have been for two cumulative reasons. First, the plaintiffs do not appear to have assets within the jurisdiction.
