Under the CB Measures, the Government required non-essential services to cease. Service-providers like Dathena had to adopt home-based remote telecommuting arrangements for their workforce and cease operations at its physical office(s). The CB Measures were originally scheduled to end on 4 May 2020. However, on 21 April 2020, the Government announced that the measures would be extended to 1 June 2020 as the Covid-19 situation in Singapore remained critical.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Due to the CB Measures, JustCo claimed it could not ready the OCBC Premises for Dathena in time for moving in on 1 May 2020. This posed a problem for Dathena as its then tenancy at One George Street (“OGS”) would expire on 1 May 2020. It should be noted at this stage that the OCBC Premises were part of OCBC Centre East (“OCBC CE”), a new development which was still under construction in early 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The representative from Dathena who negotiated with JustCo was its Lifestyle Manager Rohaidah Binte Ripangi (“Aida”) and her counterpart was Sian-Tzu Casteels (“Sian-Tzu”) who was then JustCo’s Assistant Manager of Enterprise Sales. Other people involved on Dathena’s side were its IT personnel Jérémie Simon Arnaud (“Jeremie”) and Sai Tun Nay Lin (“Sai Tun”). On JustCo’s part, the persons involved were Sheena Goh (“Sheena”) who is its Assistant Vice President &amp; Director (Enterprise Sales) and Sharlene Poh (“Sharlene”) another Assistant Manager of Enterprise Sales. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The salient events that unfolded after the Membership Agreement was signed are set out in the following paragraphs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 23 January 2020, Aida and Dathena’s IT personnel met representatives of JustCo to discuss Dathena’s requirement for early access to the server room of the OCBC Premises to enable Dathena to move in its servers in order to minimise disruptions to its operations on 1 May 2020. Early moving-in of Dathena’s servers meant that JustCo also had to provide power supply (for network installation and air-conditioning) to the server room. Dathena further required JustCo to grant early access to Dathena’s ISP who was M1, so that internet connectivity could be activated before 1 May 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Aida emailed Sian-Tzu with the list set out earlier at [5] on 19 February 2020.

These measures include prohibitions on non-essential services from working in the office and on the conduct of renovation works during the circuit breaker period. OCBC [Centre] East is a brand new [centre] and our renovations at OCBC [Centre] East are well advanced; until the circuit breaker measures were imposed, we were on track to be able to make the Allocated Office Space available to Dathena by the stipulated commencement date.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unfortunately, with the prohibition on renovation works during the circuit breaker period, and with the restrictions on renovation works following the end of the circuit breaker period, we are not yet able to confirm when Dathena’s Allocated Office Space will be available. This is entirely dependent on when the Building and Construction Authority will allow us to resume our renovation works at OCBC [Centre] East. Please be assured that we [are] following up with the Building and Construction Authority very actively and very regularly on this. No one can be more eager than us to complete the renovation works at OCBC [Centre] so that we can open it to our members.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, we are not able to agree that the membership agreement is terminated or frustrated. The delay in making the Allocated Office Space available is due to reasons entirely beyond our control. The delay is only temporary and we are doing our best to persuade the authorities to allow us to finish the renovation works as quickly as possible. Also, the membership agreement allows us to provide alternative office space to Dathena in lieu of the originally specified Allocated Office Space, and it also provides that the member will not have any claim against us for any interruption, disruption or cessation of the use of the [centre] or the Allocated Office Space.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notwithstanding our rights under the membership agreement, we do [recognise] the disruptions and difficulties which Dathena is experiencing as a result of the delay in moving into the Allocated Office Space, and we are willing to work with Dathena to find a mutually acceptable solution. On a without prejudice basis, for example, we would be willing to provide Dathena with alternative office space at preferential rates until OCBC [Centre] East is ready.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court will return to the Notice of Termination as well as JustCo’s Response in the course of this judgment. Dathena described JustCo’s Response as entirely self-serving and disappointing.

Dathena could not accept the offer as the floor plan provided by JustCo for the temporary space showed that Dathena would be sharing that space with other companies, which was not ideal, given the safe-distancing and contact tracing requirements of Covid-19 regulations.

Indeed, it was Sian-Tzu’s testimony that from the outset (in November 2019), she knew that Dathena’s lease at OGS would expire in May 2020.

This was a reliance by JustCo on the notes that Sian-Tzu purportedly made of the meeting on 10 April 2020 with Dathena but, as noted earlier at [20], Aida had contested those comments. In any case, Song’s surmise is at odds with the fact that Dathena’s lease at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road (as mentioned at [40]) was for space that was even larger than the OCBC Premises.

Not surprisingly, Aida disagreed pointing out that those premises were too small to house all staff of Dathena as well as the fact that although it is not in as prime a location as the OCBC Premises, it was more expensive on a per square foot basis.

Aida also disagreed with Mr Leong’s suggestion that Dathena backed out of the Membership Agreement for the OCBC Premises because it no longer made financial sense to Dathena as its expansion plans were put on hold due to the pandemic.

</div> Jeremie explained the importance of Dathena’s IT requirements at the OCBC Premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For security reasons and in their interests, Jeremie deposed that Dathena stored their clients’ data in Dathena’s servers rather than on the cloud. In addition, Dathena’s operations in Singapore and overseas rely on Dathena’s servers in Singapore. Jeremie therefore had to ensure that Dathena’s servers ran smoothly and without interruption for both its clients and employees (both local and overseas). If there was any outage on the data centres hosting the servers and/or downtime on the servers, there would be severe disruption to Dathena’s operations globally as their clients would face downtime and Dathena as well as its overseas offices, may be unable to work. It was therefore undesirable for Dathena to relocate its servers often, as frequent moves would lead to service disruption and heighten business continuity risks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Jeremie was aware that Aida handled negotiations with JustCo on the lease for the OCBC Premises and would have conveyed to the latter the IT requirements of Dathena. If the OCBC Premises could not accommodate Dathena’s IT requirement, he doubted that Dathena would have considered leasing the same. Jeremie deposed that Dathena required a dedicated server room with certain hardware specifications.

</div> On Dathena’s side there were concerns regarding the date when the server room at the OCBC Premises could be set up as well as when Dathena could have early access to those premises. Jeremie deposed it was crucial for Dathena to move its servers into the OCBC Premises before it moved its staff out of OGS, to ensure business continuity and minimise disruptions to Dathena’s operations. He recalled he had emphasised the importance of the server set-up to JustCo’s representatives many times in their interactions after 23 January 2020. In particular, Jeremie stated he had highlighted Dathena’s need for power, air-conditioning and networks to be installed early. Dathena also requested early access to the server room so that its ISP could complete connecting its internet line and Dathena could ensure smooth installation of its equipment and servers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In response to JustCo’s email (from Sharlene) dated 30 January 2020 requesting IT requirements and port-mapping,

Had JustCo adhered to its own earlier timeline, Dathena’s servers could have been installed and internet connectivity activated before 7 April 2020 if there had been power supply. Sian-Tzu opined that the May 2020 timelines were an error.

The court had pointed out to Sian-Tzu that four months equated to ¹/6 of the 24 months’ term under the Membership Agreement.

</div> Further, despite the 4 months’ delay in commencement of the lease, Dathena’s lease would still terminate on 30 April 2022 which meant that the lease could have only been for 20 months in any event, not 24 as JustCo counterclaimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Sheena’s involvement in the dispute after the Notice of Termination on 29 May 2020 is also largely irrelevant.

Therefore, the terms were “fair and reasonable” within the ambit of s 11(1) of the UCTA. The court is sceptical of this submission. It is quite apparent that the Membership Agreement terms are JustCo’s standard terms and conditions applicable to all its clients or “members”. No evidence was presented that there was room for negotiation of those standard terms. What was in evidence was that Dathena signed a similar agreement for its Bangkok office. Contrary to JustCo’s submissions,

Quite to the opposite, Sian-Tzu testified that the Membership Agreement is “just a standard agreement that it was -- is generated from the system”.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, the doctrine of frustration of contracts and the operation of the FCA is not dependant on parties’ agreement. It is the law that determines that a contract is frustrated if it is, regardless of the parties’ views. Once a supervening event occurs after the formation of the contract without the default of either party which renders the contractual obligation radically fundamentally different from what was agreed or, a contract becomes impossible to perform (as set out under s 2(1) of the FCA at [183]), a contract is frustrated. The result is that both parties are automatically discharged from their contract by operation of law (<span class="font-italic">Allied Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2014] 3 SLR 857).<span class="font-italic"> </span>It is <span class="font-italic">not</span> JustCo’s prerogative to decide that the Membership Agreement was not frustrated if indeed it was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Under s 2(2) of the FCA, sums paid under the frustrated contract must be refunded, which was what Dathena claimed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Did JustCo’s four month’s delay in delivering the OCBC Premises to Dathena and its inability to provide alternative comparable premises during that period render the Lease and the Membership Agreement frustrated? Was JustCo’s contractual obligation radically fundamentally different from what was agreed to? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Looking at the facts, it is this court’s finding that the answers must be in the affirmative to the foregoing two questions. Nothing could be more telling of the termination (whether via operation of law or by the Notice of Termination) of the Membership Agreement than JustCo’s own attempts to persuade Dathena to sign a new agreement to replace the Membership Agreement. Despite Sian-Tzu’s valiant attempts (as elaborated at [117]) and disagreement when questioned by the court, the court is not persuaded that the new agreement was only to <span class="font-italic">amend</span> the existing contract – it was a fresh agreement altogether for entirely different premises (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Bras Basah Premises) being the subject of the new lease. It was meant to supersede the Membership Agreement dated 16 January 2020. JustCo’s own conduct thus indicated that at the material time, it was aware that it could not perform its contractual obligations as previously agreed to in the Membership Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Consequently, JustCo’s repeated attempts to replace the Lease of the OCBC Premises with a new lease first of the Verizon Premises and subsequently, of the Bras Basah Premises amounted to a fundamentally different contract than what the parties bargained for. This is especially so in the circumstances where it was not disputed that the sizes of the alleged alternative premises were not comparable to the OCBC Premises and other factors (such as location and exclusivity to use the premises) also clearly distinguished the alternative premises from the OCBC Premises. In short, the Verizon Premises, the Bras Basah Premises, additional moving costs incurred, and significantly delayed commencement dates were simply not what parties had agreed to.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Additional findings  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 A related and disputed issue was JustCo’s allegation of Dathena’s change of business plans and its intended reduction of workforce and workspace.

</div> JustCo’s own email from Sian-Tzu to Aida clearly stated that the latter required an open plan office for <span class="font-italic">120 </span>persons. Consequently, it was an exercise in futility for JustCo’s counsel to suggest to Muffat repeatedly that the requirement to accommodate 120 staff was an afterthought on his part used to reject the Bras Basah Premises. It therefore also did not matter what Dathena’s headcount in Singapore was, between the execution of the Membership Agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 16 January 2020) and the Notice of Termination (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 May 2020). Further, it is undisputed that Dathena rented larger space at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road than what it contracted at the OCBC Premises.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 There was no basis for JustCo to surmise that during and after, the imposition of CB Measures, Dathena’s priority shifted from wanting an office space to wanting a server space. What the court does note from the evidence is, how quick JustCo was, first in pressing Dathena to execute the Membership Agreement and subsequently in invoicing Dathena for payments under the Membership Agreement even when those payments were not yet due (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the June 2020 rent mentioned at [33]–[34]). In this regard, Song’s surmise in para 4(d) of JustCo’s letter dated 27 July 2020 that “business considerations” motivated Dathena’s change of heart on renting the OCBC Premises (as mentioned at [45]) is unfounded, in the light of Dathena’s lease of alternative and larger premises at No 43 Niven Road and No 11 Blair Road after the Notice of Termination was issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As an aside, JustCo’s letter of 27 July 2020 as set out at [130] had relied on s 16 of the Covid-19 (Amendment) Act. Section 16 therein actually refers to an insertion of s 36 into the main legislation, namely the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (the “Covid-19 Act”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The entire s 36 (which is under Part 8) of the Covid-19 Act is headed “Contracts affected by delay in the performance or breach of a construction contract, supply contract or related contract”. It applies where certain requirements are met, such that under s 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) as parties entering into a contract that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) is, on or after 1 February 2020 and before the expiry of the prescribed period, affected in the prescribed manner by a delay in the performance by a party to a construction (or construction-related) contract …, or a breach of such contract, where such delay or breach (A) occurs on or after 1 February 2020 and before the expiry of the prescribed period; and (B) is to a material extent caused by a COVID-19 event.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Under Schedule 2 Part 2(2) of the Covid-19 Act. “Essential Services” include services related to (a) fixed telephony services; (b) mobile telephony services; (c) broadband internet access services; and (d) national domain name registry services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Based on Sian-Tzu’s testimony as mentioned at [117], the court finds that JustCo could have but failed to take steps (as the tenant of OCBC CE) to assist M1 to activate Dathena’s internet connection at the OCBC Premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 JustCo’s repeated refrain in its closing submissions that it was never given an opportunity to address Dathena’s concerns (regarding KDDI, the Verizon and Bras Basah Premises) does not sit well with the evidence that was adduced.

As JustCo was not knowledgeable of IT, the court does not see why Dathena was obliged to update JustCo on KDDI’s unsuitability (as explained at [95]), bearing in mind that by mid-May 2020, Dathena was forced to contract with Vodien to host its servers as it had vacated its previous premises at OGS by early May 2020 (of which Sian-Tzu was informed much earlier on 10 April 2020, at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 In the light of the above findings, the court rules in favour of Dathena on its claim.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Does JustCo have a valid counterclaim?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Sheena’s testimony on when JustCo stated looking for tenants to take over the space leased to Dathena was highly unsatisfactory.

Under O 22A r 9(1)(b) of the Rules, Dathena is therefore entitled to costs on a standard basis to the date of its OTS and costs on an indemnity basis thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 As the court has dismissed JustCo’s Counterclaim, its OTS need not be considered. Since Dathena’s OTS did not include JustCo’s Counterclaim, costs of the Counterclaim to Dathena will be on a standard basis.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Accordingly, the court grants Dathena the declaration requested in its SOC, namely that the Membership Agreement was terminated with effect from 29 May 2020 and awards Dathena judgment in the sum of $286,891.50 together with interest at 5.33% per annum from 4 September 2020 until payment, Dathena is entitled to costs for its claim on a standard basis until 7 January 2020 and costs on an indemnity basis from 8 January 2020. Conversely, JustCo’s Counterclaim is dismissed with costs to Dathena on a standard basis.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Tay Weiwen, Lin Ruizi, Lim Wei Zhen @ Jennifer Lim Wei Zhen (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leong Li Shiong, Chai Rui Min Angela (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
