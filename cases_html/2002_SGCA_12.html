<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court

setting aside an order of the Assistant Registrar granting leave to the appellants to

serve an Originating Motion out of jurisdiction on the respondents. At the conclusion of

the hearing we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons. 

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The background</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">2.    The facts giving rise to the institution of this Originating

Motion were largely undisputed. The appellant (Garuda), an Indonesian company, and the

respondent (Birgen), a Belgium company, entered into an agreement dated 20 January 1996

whereby Birgen agreed to lease one DC 10-30 aircraft to Garuda for use by pilgrims to

Saudi Arabia for the Hajj (the lease agreement). The lease agreement expressly provided

that the governing law would be the law of Indonesia and that disputes arising therefrom

were to be referred for arbitration in Jakarta. </p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Subsequently a dispute arose because Birgen proposed to substitute

the aircraft under the lease agreement and the dispute was referred to arbitration in

accordance with the terms thereof, with Garuda as the claimant and Birgen, the respondent.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The arbitral tribunal consisted of Dr Clyde Croft, as Chairman,

and Professor Priyatna Abdurrasyid and Professor Nurkut Inan as co-arbitrators. From

February 1999, the tribunal, through its Chairman, Dr Croft, sought to set dates for the

hearing of the arbitration. As regards the place of hearing, the Chairman informed the

parties on 24 February that the tribunal thought that Jakarta was not an appropriate place

given the then situation prevailing in Indonesia and proposed that the tribunal should sit

in Zurich. On 11 and 12 March 1999, Birgen and Garuda respectively responded but neither

made any comment on the tribunal’s proposal to have the hearing in Zurich. On 30

March 1999, Dr Croft proposed that the hearing of the arbitration be carried out in

Singapore rather than in Zurich.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    On 7 April 1999, M/s Donald H Bunker and Associates (Donald

Bunker), the lawyers for Birgen, replied requesting that the tribunal proceed to decide

the case on the basis of the documents without any hearing but if that request were not

granted then they were agreeable, inter alia, that "Jakarta is not an appropriate

place for the hearing and accepts the tribunal’s proposal to sit in Singapore."</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    On 21 May 1999, Dr Croft wrote to the lawyers for the parties

asking for their comments on certain matters, including Birgen’s application for

"documents only arbitration". Nevertheless, he also notified the parties that

"the tribunal had decided that this matter will be heard on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in

Singapore". On 10 June 1999 Gani Djemat &amp; Partners (Gani Djemat), lawyers for

Garuda, wrote indicating, inter alia, that they agreed that "the hearing to take

place on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in Singapore."</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    On 23 July 1999 by another letter to both Donald Bunker and Gani

Djemat, the lawyers for the parties, Dr Croft reiterated that "a hearing will take

place in Singapore" on the appointed dates.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    The hearing was duly held in Singapore and a Final Award, dated 15

February 2000, was handed down which was signed by two members, Dr Croft and Prof Inan.

The third member, Prof Abdurrasyid, declined to sign it and rendered a dissenting opinion.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    The Final Award stated that it was delivered at Jakarta and the

tribunal in 39 also made the following comments:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"It had not been suggested by either of the parties, nor is it the

  view of the Arbitral Tribunal, that the use of Singapore as a convenient place for the

  hearing had any substantive or procedural impact on the proceedings."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">10.    On 18 May 2000, the majority of the tribunal handed down an

Addendum to the Final Award on account of a computational error.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    On 3 January 2001, Garuda filed a Notice of Originating Motion

(OM) in the High Court in Singapore to set aside the Final Award and the Addendum, and for

various other reliefs. The application was based on s 24 of the International Arbitration

Act (IA Act) and Article 34 of the Model Law. Article 34 sets out the grounds upon which

an award governed by the Model Law may be set aside by the court. Section 24 sets out

grounds, additional to those in Article 34, upon which the High Court may set aside an

award. In the view of the judge below, s 24 and Article 34 are closely linked – if

Article 34 is not applicable to an arbitration, then s 24 will also not be applicable. We

agree with this construction. Garuda did not appeal against this determination. </p>
<p xmlns="">12.    On 27 March 2001 Garuda applied ex-parte for leave to serve the

Notice of OM on Birgen out of Singapore and also for leave to serve the Notice by

substituted service within Singapore (i.e., on Birgen’s Singapore solicitors). On 30

March 2001, the Assistant Registrar made an order substantially in the terms prayed for by

Garuda.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    On 7 April 2001, Birgen applied to set aside the order of 30

March 2001 of the Assistant Registrar. On 26 July 2001, Woo Bih Li JC set aside the order

and all proceedings taken pursuant thereof. Thus, this appeal by Garuda against the

decision of Woo JC. </p>
<p xmlns="">14.    In coming to his decision, the judge below found – 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) there was material non-disclosure on the part of Garuda and this

  ground alone was sufficient for him to set aside the leave to serve the Notice of OM out

  of jurisdiction. The non-disclosure related to terms in the lease agreement, clauses in

  the Terms of Reference for the arbitration, the exchange of correspondence and the views

  expressed by the tribunal on the question of the place of the arbitration as set out in

  the Award.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) this was not a proper case to grant leave to Garuda to serve the

  papers out of jurisdiction as the place of arbitration remained at Jakarta.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">15.    We should further mention that the judge below had also set aside

the leave granted to Garuda to serve the papers on Birgen in Singapore by substituted

service. This aspect of the decision of Woo JC was not appealed against.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Issues on appeal</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">16.    Garuda’s application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction

was made pursuant to Order 69A r 4. Under r 4(2) it is stated that no leave shall be

granted unless "it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is

a proper one for service out of jurisdiction." This test is almost identical to the

test prescribed in O 11 r 2, which relates to service in general out of jurisdiction: the

test of a proper case. Accordingly, in arriving at his decision the judge below relied on

cases relating to O 11 r 2(2) which required that the applicant must show, first, that

there were merits in the case and, second, that Singapore was a <i>forum conveniens. </i>In

this regard the judge also adopted the opinion of the Court of Appeal in <i>Overseas Union

Insurance Ltd v Incorporated General Insurance Ltd </i>[1992] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 439.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    Before us Garuda did not dispute that they must satisfy those two

requirements. Birgen’s case was that Garuda failed to satisfy both requirements by

reason of the fact that the place of arbitration was not Singapore but Jakarta and thus

Singapore courts did not have jurisdiction in the matter. However, the position taken by

Garuda was that the parties had subsequently agreed to change "the place of

arbitration" to Singapore.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    There were, therefore, three main issues before us. First,

whether there was an agreement between the parties, in the light of the correspondence

referred to above, followed by the actual hearing of the arbitration in Singapore, to

alter the place of the arbitration from Jakarta to Singapore. Second, whether Singapore

was the place most clearly connected with the arbitration and whether this was the most

appropriate forum to hear the application in the OM. Third, whether there was a material

non-disclosure on the part of Garuda in their application for leave to serve out of

jurisdiction and, if this were the case, what should be the consequence thereof.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Place of Arbitration</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">19.    In filing the OM, Garuda relied upon the International

Arbitration Act (IA Act), an Act to make provision for the conduct of international

commercial arbitrations based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration

adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (the Model Law) on 21

June 1985. By s 3(1) of the IA Act, the Model Law (except Chapter VIII thereof) shall have

the force of law in Singapore. Section 24 empowers the Singapore High Court to set aside

the award of an arbitral tribunal in certain specified circumstances, other than those

described in Article 34 of the Model Law.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    Some of the relevant provisions of the Model Law are the

following:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<u>Article 1(2): Scope of application</u></p>
<p align="justify">The provisions of this Law, except Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36, apply

  only if the place of arbitration is in the territory of this State ("this State"

  is defined to mean Singapore).</p>
<u><p align="justify">Article 20: Place of arbitration</p>
</u><p align="justify">(1) The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration.

  Failing such agreement, the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral

  tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the

  parties.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article,

  the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it

  considers appropriate for consultation among members, for hearing witnesses, experts or

  parties, or for inspection of goods, property or documents."</p>
<u><p align="justify">Article 31: Forms and contents of award</p>
</u><p align="justify">(3) The award shall state its date and the place of arbitration as

  determined in accordance with Article 20(1). The award shall be deemed to have been made

  at that place.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">21.    From Articles 1(2) and 20 it will be seen that unless Singapore

is the "place of arbitration" the Singapore courts can only intervene in

relation to an arbitration governed by the Model Law in the limited instances set out in

Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36. Thus, Article 34 only applies if an arbitration has its

"place of arbitration" in Singapore. </p>
<p xmlns="">22.    Garuda did not dispute that the Model Law is only applicable

where the place of arbitration is Singapore. Their main plank of argument was that

Singapore was the place of arbitration and not Jakarta and thus, the Model Law applied.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    It should be apparent from Article 20 that there is a distinction

between "place of arbitration" and the place where the arbitral tribunal carries

on hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, namely, the "venue of hearing".

The place of arbitration is a matter to be agreed by the parties. Where they have so

agreed, the place of arbitration does not change even though the tribunal may meet to hear

witnesses or do any other things in relation to the arbitration at a location other than

the place of arbitration.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    Thus the place of arbitration does not change merely because the

tribunal holds its hearing at a different place or places. It only changes where the

parties so agree. The significance of the place of arbitration lies in the fact that for

legal reasons the arbitration is to be regarded as situated in that state or territory. It

identifies a state or territory whose laws will govern the arbitral process. The following

passage of Kerr LJ in <i>Naviera Amazonica Peruana SA v Cia International de Seguros</i>

[1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 116, (<i>Amazonica </i>case), while it did not relate to the

Model Law, is nevertheless germane (at 120):- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, it seems clear that the

  submissions advanced below confused the legal ‘seat’ etc. of an arbitration with

  the geographically convenient place or places for holding hearings. This distinction is

  nowadays a common feature of international arbitrations and is helpfully explained in

  Redfern and Hunter at p.69 in the following passage under the heading ‘The Place of

  Arbitration’:</p>
<p align="justify">The preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one

  ‘place’ of arbitration. This will be the place chosen by or on behalf of the

  parties; and it will be designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of reference

  or the minutes of proceedings or in some other way as the place or ‘seat’ of the

  arbitration. <u>This does not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its

  meetings or hearings at the place of arbitration</u>. International commercial arbitration

  often involves people of many different countries. In these circumstances, <u>it is by no

  means unusual for an arbitral tribunal to hold meetings -–or even hearings – in

  a place other than the designated place of arbitration, either for its own convenience or

  for the convenience of the parties or their witnesses … It may be more convenient for

  an arbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country –

  for instance, for the purpose of taking evidence</u> … In such circumstances, each

  move of the arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of the arbitration

  changes. The seat of the arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of

  the parties." (emphasis added).</p>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that the English concept of "seat of

  arbitration" is the same as "place of arbitration" under the Model Law.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">25.    While the agreement to change the place of arbitration may be

implied, it must be clear. This is in the interest of certainty. By choosing the

"place of arbitration" the parties would have also thereby decided on the law

which is to govern the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The evidence on place of arbitration</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">26.    We shall now refer to the relevant provisions of the lease

agreement which have a bearing on the question of the place of arbitration. 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<u><p align="justify">Clause 16.8: Governing Law</p>
</u><p align="justify">This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed

  in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia, including all matters of

  construction, validity and performance.</p>
<u><p align="justify">Clause 16.9: Arbitration</p>
</u><p align="justify">In the event that a commercial controversy or claim …. such

  controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration held before a board of three

  qualified arbiters. <u>The parties agree that such arbitration shall be held in Jakarta,

  Indonesia</u> and conducted in the English language in accordance with the Rules of

  Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. (emphasis added).</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">27.    Next we turn to the Terms of Reference of the arbitration which

the parties had agreed. The following are pertinent:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"6 Place of Arbitration.</p>
<p align="justify">6.1 <u>The place of arbitration is Jakarta, Indonesia</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">6.2 The arbitral Tribunal and the Parties may convene at any other

  location if necessary, for example, for a view.</p>
<p align="justify">6.3 …. </p>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added).</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">28.    From these two documents, it is clear that the parties had agreed

that the governing law of the lease agreement was Indonesian law and that the place of

arbitration was Jakarta. So was there a subsequent agreement to alter the place of

arbitration? We have in 4 to 7 set out the relevant correspondence. It would be

recalled that in February 1999 the tribunal first suggested, in view of the turmoil in

Indonesia, that it should sit in Zurich. It was on 30 March 1999 that the tribunal

proposed Singapore in place of Zurich. On 7 April 1999 the lawyers for Birgen replied

accepting the tribunal’s proposal to sit in Singapore. There was no reply from Garuda

on the proposal. On 21 May 1999, the tribunal informed the parties of the hearing in

Singapore on 4-6 August 1999. It was only on 10 June 1999 that the lawyers for Garuda,

Gani Djemat, replied stating that they agreed to the hearing in Singapore on the specified

dates. The hearing was accordingly held here.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    From these, Garuda contended that there was an implied agreement

to change the place of arbitration, and thus the <i>lex fori</i>, or curial law, from

Jakarta to Singapore and they relied upon the <i>Amazonica</i> case. But this authority is

hardly relevant. In <i>Amazonica</i>, the plaintiffs insured their vessels with the

defendants. The policy provided that the city of Lima was to have jurisdiction over all

disputes. However, it also provided that arbitration was to be governed by the conditions

and laws of England. A dispute arose between the parties and the issue for determination

by the court was whether the arbitration was to be held in London or Lima. Quite clearly

there was ambiguity in the clauses of the policy. </p>
<p xmlns="">30.    At first instance, the High Court ruled that the arbitration was

to be held in Lima but governed by English law as the <i>lex fori. </i>The Court of Appeal

reversed that decision and held that the seat of arbitration should be London where it

would be governed by English law, thereby avoiding the situation of an arbitration in

country X being governed by the law of country Y. The Court of Appeal made the following

proposition:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Prima facie, i.e., in the absence of some express and clear provision

  to the contrary, it must follow that an agreement that the curial or procedural law of an

  arbitration is to be the law of X has the consequence that X is also to be the

  ‘seat’ of the arbitration. The <i>lex fori</i> is then the law of X, and

  accordingly, X is the agreed forum of the arbitration. A further consequence is then that

  the Courts which are competent to control or assist the arbitration are the Courts

  exercising jurisdiction at X.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">31.    Also relying on <i>Amazonica,</i> and in view of the fact that

the parties agreed to the tribunal’s suggestion of having the hearing in Singapore,

Garuda made the alternative contention that it followed that the parties had chosen

Singapore law as the law governing the arbitration, the curial law, and had thereby also

impliedly chosen Singapore as the "place of arbitration". This argument is

circular and is also flawed because it is based on the false premise that the parties had

chosen Singapore law as the curial law. In fact, the parties made no such choice. By

stating in the lease agreement and the Terms of Reference, that the place of arbitration

was Jakarta, it must follow that the curial law would be Indonesian law. The curial law

would be Singapore law only if it was established that the parties had agreed to alter the

"place of arbitration" from Jakarta to Singapore.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    The second case relied by Garuda was <i>Union of India v

McDonnell Douglas Corporation</i> [1933] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 48 where the contract provided

that the arbitration should be conducted in accordance with the procedures provided in the

Indian Arbitration Act 1940 and that the seat of arbitration proceedings should be in

London. The issue was whether the law governing the arbitration proceedings was English or

Indian law. The court was of the view that by specifying London as the seat of

arbitration, it was reasonable to assume from that choice that they attached some

importance to the relevant laws of England. Saville J stated (at p.50):- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is clear from the authorities cited above that English law does

  admit of at least the theoretical possibility that the parties are free to choose to hold

  their arbitration in one country but subject to the procedural laws of another, but

  against this is the undoubted fact that such an agreement is calculated to give rise to

  great difficulties and complexities as Lord Justice Kerr observed in the <i>Amazonica</i>

  decision.</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">and concluded,</p>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">….. it seems to me that by their agreement, the parties have

  chosen English law as the law to govern their arbitration proceedings, while contractually

  importing from the Indian Act those provisions of that Act which are concerned with the

  internal conduct of their arbitration and which are not inconsistent with the choice of

  English arbitral procedural law.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">33.    The court also felt that the jurisdiction of the English Court

under the Arbitration Acts over an arbitration in England could not be excluded by

agreement between the parties to apply the laws of another country. We would emphasise

that the court was there referring to an arbitration where the seat was in England. This

was not the situation here. Clearly, if it was established that the parties had agreed to

change the "place of arbitration" to Singapore, then it must follow that the

curial law would be Singapore law.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    It is incontrovertible that parties are at liberty to change the

place of arbitration. In <i>ABB Lummus v Keppel FELS</i> (1999) 2 Lloyd’s Rep 24,

there was such an express agreement to alter the place of arbitration from Singapore to

London. <i>ABB Lummus</i> cannot help us determine whether the parties here had, in fact,

agreed to change the place of arbitration.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    We were unable to accept Garuda’s contention that just

because the parties eventually agreed with the arbitrators’ suggestion that the

hearing be held in Singapore, there was in consequence such an agreement to alter the

place of arbitration from Jakarta to Singapore. What was changed was the "venue of

hearing". This comes out clearly from the language of the correspondence.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.    In our opinion, Garuda’s argument failed to give effect to

the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Model Law which expressly authorize the tribunal to

meet at any place, other than the agreed place of arbitration, to hear witnesses and the

parties. The opening words of Article 20(2), "notwithstanding the provisions of

paragraph (1) of this Article", clearly mean that such a hearing by the tribunal at a

different location from that of the place of arbitration does not alter what was the

agreed place of arbitration. Indeed, the tribunal confirmed the hearing to be in Singapore

even before receiving any indication from Garuda: see Dr Croft’s letter of 21 May

1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.    This view of the matter is clearly consistent with the views of

the learned authors of <i>Redfern &amp; Hunter on International Arbitrations</i>, which

were cited by Kerr LJ in <i>Amazonica</i> and which we have quoted in 24 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.    Garuda seemed to have placed great emphasis on the fact that the

hearing of the arbitration was held entirely in Singapore and nowhere else. But an

arbitration proceeding does not comprise only of the oral hearing and the submission. It

encompasses an entire process, commencing from the appointment of the arbitrator or

arbitrators to the rendering of the final award.</p>
<p xmlns="">39.    While both <i>Amazonica</i> and <i>Union Bank of India</i> did

not involve the Model Law, and could be distinguished on that basis, the real

differentiating feature there lies in the fact that in both those cases the relevant

clauses were far from clear. We have alluded to that before. But in the instant case, the

lease agreement was abundantly clear: the lease agreement was to be governed by Indonesian

law and the place of arbitration was Jakarta, which must also mean that the arbitration

proceedings were subject to Indonesian law.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    In the result, Article 34 of the Model Law and s 24 of the IA Act

did not apply to the Final Award. There was no basis for Garuda to file the OM in the

Singapore High Court. </p>
<p xmlns="">41.    Following from this determination, and bearing in mind that

Indonesian law governed both the lease agreement and the arbitration proceedings (the

place of arbitration being Jakarta) and the award was rendered in Jakarta, it must

necessarily follow that Indonesia was clearly the most appropriate forum. Accordingly,

this was not a "proper case" where leave to serve the Notice of Originating

Motion out of jurisdiction should be granted.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    It is thus wholly unnecessary for us to go into the third issue,

on material non-disclosure, set out in 18 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    Before we conclude, we should mention that counsel for the

respondent submitted that the judge below had perhaps gone a little too far when he stated

in his judgment (at 94) that:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">As the place of arbitration is not Singapore, neither Article 34 of the

  Model Law nor, for that matter, Part II of the Act, will apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">Counsel seemed to be suggesting that while the Model Law will not apply to an

international arbitration, as far as Singapore courts are concerned, if the place of

arbitration is not Singapore, the same does not necessarily follow as regards Part II

(except s 24) of the IA Act. As counsel for the appellant had not submitted on this aspect

and as this point did not really concern the case, and in the absence of full arguments

from both counsel, we are not inclined to offer any views on it.</p>
