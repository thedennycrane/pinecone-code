On the same day, the second defendant, Mr Yip Fook Meng (“Mr Yip”), signed a personal guarantee (the “Guarantee”) undertaking to pay to the plaintiff, on demand, all sums owing and payable by the first defendant under the Loan Agreement. The second defendant also handed the plaintiff a duly executed Letter of Authority (the “LOA”) which assigned to the plaintiff $309,000 out of the sale proceeds of his property at Rangoon Road (the “Rangoon Road Property”) upon completion of the sale on 30 June 2017.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, he relies on four defences in his submissions: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the illegality of the Guarantee under s 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) mental incapacity under the common law; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) mental incapacity under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MCA”); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 With regards to illegality, the second defendant submits that the Loan Agreement, under which the first defendant is the borrower, is a sham as he is the true borrower (“personal loan illegality”). As a result, the plaintiff is presumed to be a “moneylender” under s 3 of the MLA because it lent money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid and, since the Loan is not to a corporation, the plaintiff is not an “excluded moneylender” (as defined in s 2 of the MLA). Under s 2 of the MLA, those presumed to be moneylenders in s 3 are also “unlicensed moneylender[s]”, and any guarantee given for a loan granted by an unlicensed moneylender is unenforceable under s 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MLA.

</div>
</div> Alternatively, the second defendant argues that even without the statutory presumption in s 3 of the MLA, the plaintiff admits that it carried on the business of moneylending and that it does not hold a moneylender’s licence. This is sufficient to constitute it as an unlicensed moneylender under s 2 of the MLA and the Guarantee is hence unenforceable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In respect of mental incapacity at common law, both parties confined their submissions to whether the plaintiff had knowledge of the second defendant’s mental incapacity at the time the Guarantee was signed. The second defendant submits that the plaintiff should be affixed with constructive knowledge – the circumstances surrounding the 22 June meetings were “suspicious” and the evidence of its expert witness, Professor Kua Ee Heok (“Professor Kua”), illustrates that abnormalities in the second defendant’s behaviour at the 22 June meetings should have put the plaintiff on notice.

It follows that the plaintiff is not an “unlicensed moneylender” as the presumption in s 3 of the MLA is not enlivened and it falls outside the definition of a moneylender in s 2 of the MLA.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 To the extent that the allegation of personal loan illegality was never put to the plaintiff’s directors, and only raised belatedly in the course of trial and in the second defendant’s closing submissions (“2DCS”), the plaintiff’s frustration is understandable. However, such prejudice does not prevent me from ruling on the basis of personal loan illegality. Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings Pte Ltd v Bina Puri Holdings Bhd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 666 (“<span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span>”) at [98] (which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew </span><span class="font-italic">May </span>at [31] and <span class="font-italic">Fan Ren Ray and others v Toh Fong Peng and others </span>[2020] SGCA 117<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [15]) explained as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[i]f there is any judicial reluctance to allow a party to rely on illegality when that party has not pleaded it, the reluctance is attributable solely to the court’s concern that the court may have been deprived of relevant facts and not because of possible procedural unfairness to the other party. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The manner in which the case was conducted also ameliorates, to some extent the prejudice to the plaintiff. Namely, in response to [13] of the Defence, which states that “the plaintiff purported to have lent to the [first] defendant a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid” and that “the plaintiff is presumed under Section 3 of the [MLA] to be a moneylender”, the plaintiff averred at [8] of its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) (the “Reply”) that "loans are <span class="font-italic">only</span> provided to <span class="font-underline">commercial entities for commercial purposes</span>…, as such the Plaintiff is considered to be an excluded money lender under the [MLA]" [emphasis in original in underline; emphasis added in italics]. Evidently, the plaintiff’s case, from the outset, was that the Loan Agreement was a <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide </span>corporate loan. Further, under cross-examination, one of the plaintiff’s Directors, Mr Ong Leng Hock (“Mr Ong”), was given the opportunity to explain why the Loan Agreement is not a sham, albeit in response to a different case – that the LOA was the heart of a scam to claw away a portion of the second defendant’s sale proceeds of the Rangoon Road Property and that the Guarantee was a mere afterthought to give the LOA a semblance of legitimacy.

By interposing the first defendant as a conduit for the personal loan, Mr Elangovan sought to procure the service fee of $15,000 from the Loan moneys (see [3] above) and further hoped that the second defendant would invest in the first defendant in the future.

</div> In the first defendant’s reply to the plaintiff’s letter of demand in respect of the Loan Agreement, the first defendant also directed the plaintiff to “look to [the second defendant] to make payment of the Loan Amount” based on the plaintiff’s “knowledge of the mode of repayment as well as the personal guarantee”.

Ironically, it is the plaintiff who subpoenaed him, albeit for the limited purpose of testifying as to the second defendant’s mental capacity.

</div> However, I remain minded to attach significance to Mr Elangovan’s evidence. Mr Elangovan had a vested interest at the 22 June meetings to shift the liability for repayment away from the first defendant. As the plaintiff recognises, he was the sole shareholder and director of the first defendant prior to the second defendant’s appointment as a director on 14 June 2017.

Admittedly, when taken in isolation, such intention does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff further intended to treat the second defendant as the true borrower. It is possible for a genuine borrower to legitimately arrange for the lender to seek repayment from the guarantor without first making a demand on the borrower (Geraldine Andrews &amp; Richard Millett, <span class="font-italic">Law of Guarantees</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2015) at para 7-006). However, when viewed alongside Mr Elangovan’s evidence (see [29]–[33] above) <span class="font-italic">and</span> the following two aspects of Mr Ong’s testimony, it becomes clear that the plaintiff intended the second defendant to be the true borrower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 First, I find it telling that the plaintiff did not perform due diligence on the first defendant’s ability to repay the Loan or whether it was operating a business at the material time.

In <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>, where the loans in question were affirmed as commercial loans between commercial entities, the Court of Appeal observed at [85] that the corporate borrower “had been selected [from among a group of companies] because it had the strongest balance sheet in the group”. In a similar vein, I have no doubt that the level of due diligence conducted by the plaintiff in deciding to enter into the Loan Agreement is relevant to whether the first defendant was the true borrower.

</div> Given the plaintiff’s knowledge of the second defendant’s insubstantial and late involvement in the first defendant’s affairs, and in light of the point made in the preceding paragraph, it is more likely than not that <span class="font-italic">both</span> the plaintiff and first defendant intended the Loan Agreement to be a sham at the time that it was signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 While the plaintiff obtained a judgment-in-default of appearance against the first defendant and examined it as a judgment debtor, I merely regarded this as part of the charade to paint the first defendant as the true borrower under the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Pulling all the strands together, I find that there is cogent evidence that both the plaintiff and first defendant intended the second defendant to be the true borrower and that the Loan Agreement is a sham. The form of the Loan Agreement does not reflect its substance (<span class="font-italic">Sheagar </span>at [81]). Consequently, the plaintiff is not an excluded moneylender as it does not lend money solely to corporations (s 2 of the MLA) and a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> presumption under s 3 of the MLA arises.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is the presumption in s 3 of the MLA rebutted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 However, even if the presumption under s 3 of the MLA is raised, the plaintiff may rebut the presumption by proving that it is not in the business of moneylending: s 2 of the MLA; <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span> at [75(c)]. There are two tests to determine whether a person is in the business of moneylending. The first is whether there is a certain degree of system and continuity in the moneylending transactions (the “first test”). If the answer is in the negative, the court applies the second test, which is whether the alleged moneylender is one who is willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible (the “second test”): <span class="font-italic">Mak Chik Lun and others v Loh Kim Her and others and another action </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 338 at [11]–[12], affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Leong Pek Gan</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1091 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Pek Gan</span>”) at [72]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In the present case, the first test is answered in the negative as only one loan was extended by the plaintiff. However, in respect of the second test, I accept that the plaintiff is willing to lend to “all and sundry”.

</div>
</div> While the plaintiff alleges that the first defendant is the borrower, it did not perform due diligence on the first defendant’s ability to make repayment or whether it was operating a business at the material time (see [39] above). Second, Mr Ong knew that a personal loan to the second defendant was prohibited under the MLA (see [43] above). Nevertheless, having been promised an assignment of the sale proceeds of the second defendant’s property and a personal guarantee from the second defendant, the plaintiff saw an opportunity for a quick profit and proceeded to disguise what it knew was, in substance, a personal loan to the second defendant as a corporate one so as to evade the MLA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Since the presumption under s 3 of the MLA remains unrebutted, it follows that the plaintiff is an “unlicensed moneylender” under <br>s 2 of the MLA. As such, the second defendant’s Guarantee given for the Loan Agreement is unenforceable under s 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MLA. Further, pursuant to s 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), any money paid by the plaintiff under the contract for the Loan is unrecoverable. Given these findings, I need not consider the second defendant’s alternative submission in respect of the personal loan illegality defence (see [25] above) and say no more on it.</br></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Re-visiting the procedural objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 To recapitulate, it is clear that the evidence adduced establishes the personal loan illegality defence. I now return to the related, but distinct, question of whether all relevant facts are before the court; this is the nub of the plaintiff’s procedural objection (see [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Having scrutinised the evidence, I find that all relevant facts have been placed before me. Even if the personal loan illegality defence had been put to the plaintiff’s directors, it would ultimately be a case of their word against Mr Elangovan’s. Their denials would ring hollow against the body of evidence quite apart from Mr Elangovan’s account, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Mr Ong and Mr Koh’s evidence and the objective circumstances surrounding the Loan Agreement which prove that the Loan Agreement is a sham. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo</span> [2015] 1 SLR 581 (“<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span>”), a case in which the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s acceptance of the respondent’s no case to answer submission premised on the illegality of a guarantee sued upon under the MLA is also instructive. In that case, loans had originally been extended to an individual who had since declared himself bankrupt. The lender then sued the guarantor of the loans to recover the debt.  The guarantor raised a similar defence to the one at present – that the guarantee was unenforceable for being contrary to s 5 of the MLA (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [20]). The guarantor also argued that certain Promissory Notes, which were extraneous to the loans, were actually part and parcel of the loans. This was done so as to prove that a higher sum than the original loan amounts was to be repaid and that consequently, the presumption under s 3 of the MLA was enlivened. However, the guarantor’s Defence failed to even mention the Promissory notes and the presumption of moneylending in s 3 of the MLA (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi </span>at [20] and [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60  Given that the loans were not <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>illegal, and that repayment of a greater sum than what was borrowed would be established only if extraneous evidence was relied on, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Promissory Notes, the Court of Appeal held that the guarantor was not entitled to rely on s 3 of the MLA to establish illegality. Such extraneous evidence is inadmissible unless the circumstances relied on are pleaded (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi </span>at [37], citing <span class="font-italic">Edler</span>). In other words, the First and Second <span class="font-italic">Edler</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Propositions precluded the guarantor’s reliance on s 3 of the MLA. Further, the Third and Fourth <span class="font-italic">Edler</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Propositions did not assist the guarantor – the Court of Appeal opined that the evidence which had been led did not connect the Promissory Notes to the loan (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [52]–[56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Contrastingly, in the present case, while the Loan Agreement is not <span class="font-italic">ex facie </span>illegal, all relevant facts have been adduced at trial and these facts establish the personal loan illegality defence. The Third and Fourth <span class="font-italic">Edler</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Propositions, together with my positive duty to take cognisance of evidence of illegality which is revealed (<span class="font-italic">ANC Holdings</span> at [84]), provide me the basis to rule on the issue of personal loan illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In these premises, the Guarantee is unenforceable under s 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I take this opportunity to highlight that my decision is in no way intended to constrict or prevent the flow of liquidity in commerce among smaller businesses. I am cognisant of the commercial reality that small businesses are “often unable to obtain credit facilities from established financial institutions as a result of their lack of standing, unpredictable cash flow and higher risk profile” (<span class="font-italic">City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 733 at [48]). However, where the parties have deliberately interposed a corporate entity to disguise a personal loan as a corporate one, the courts cannot turn a blind eye.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mental incapacity at common law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 While my finding in respect of the personal loan illegality defence is sufficient to determine the plaintiff’s claim, I proceed to consider the remainder of the parties’ submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the alternative, the second defendant submits that the Guarantee is annulled given his mental incapacity at the material time. The test for determining whether a contract is voidable due to a party’s mental incapacity is set out in <span class="font-italic">Che Som bte Yip and </span><span class="font-italic">others v Maha Pte Ltd and others </span>[1989] 2 SLR(R) 60 (“<span class="font-italic">Che Som </span><span class="font-italic">bte Yip</span>”) at [28] and [29], and is not disputed. The second defendant must prove that the plaintiff “knew or ought to have known that the [second defendant] was mentally disordered and had no contractual capacity” (<span class="font-italic">Che Som bte </span><span class="font-italic">Yip</span> at [29]). The plaintiff is not challenging the fact that the second defendant was mentally incapacitated at the material time (see [2] above). Therefore, the issue is whether, on the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff had actual or constructive knowledge of the second defendant’s mental incapacity at the time the Guarantee was entered into (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 22 June 2017).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The evidence before me does not support a finding of actual knowledge. Consequently, whether the contract is rendered voidable turns on whether the plaintiff should be affixed with constructive knowledge. Preliminarily, I disagree with the second defendant’s contention that <span class="font-italic">Che Som bte </span><span class="font-italic">Yip</span> sets a low bar for establishing constructive knowledge.

</div> While the second defendant claims that the only suspicious circumstance in that case was the third plaintiff’s execution of the mortgage deed by thumbprint (instead of by signature), the court at [32] explicitly inferred constructive knowledge from the entire “circumstances surrounding the execution of the mortgage deed by the third plaintiff, including the way in which the bank dealt with the owners/mortgagors of the said property.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In this case, I will consider the evidence of: (a) those present at the 22 June meetings; (b) the second defendant’s own expert witnesses; and (c) the plaintiff’s other witnesses, to ascertain if a reasonable person at the 22 June meetings ought to have known of the second defendant’s mental incapacity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Witnesses at the 22 June meetings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The first meeting on the morning of 22 June 2017 (the “First meeting”) lasted between 30 minutes to an hour, and the second meeting in the afternoon of the same day (the “Second meeting”) lasted for about 40 minutes.

</div> While these examinations precede the 22 June meetings, Dr Manu Lal’s general impressions of how the second defendant fared in a social setting remain relevant. From those two assessments, he did not observe any “oddities of behaviour” and instead opined that the second defendant could “understand information relevant to a decision relating to his … property and affairs”, even if he was unable to weigh such information in order to make decisions.

To the contrary, Mr Elangovan and Mr Koh’s testimony of the second defendant’s unremarkable behaviour at the 22 June meetings (see [73] above), and the evidence of the second defendant’s experts, Dr Lai, Mr Poon and Mr Fernandez undermines the contention that the plaintiff ought to have known of the second defendant’s mental incapacity.

The Mental Capacity Affidavit was filed by Mr Fernandez, the solicitor representing the second defendant in SUM 2315/2017 at the material time.

The reliability of the <span class="font-italic">contents</span> of the Mental Capacity Affidavit aside, Mr Fernandez’s testimony indicating that the second defendant possessed the capacity to instruct him around the time that the Guarantee was signed is significant.

As such, his plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> cannot succeed on the basis of there being a radical difference between what was believed to be signed and what the Guarantee actually means. To successfully establish <span class="font-italic">non est </span><span class="font-italic">factum</span>, the second defendant must instead prove that his mental incapacity impaired his understanding to such an extent that the element of consent required for contractual formation is totally lacking (<span class="font-italic">Saunders</span> at 1025; <span class="font-italic">Ford (by his tutor Watkinson) v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Ltd </span>(2009) 257 ALR 658 (“<span class="font-italic">Ford</span>”) at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, the tests to render a contract voidable due to a party’s mental incapacity (see [65] above) and void under a plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> (see [103] above) are not identical. Just because a party is mentally incapacitated does not necessarily mean that his/her plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> will succeed.

This definition of mental capacity in <span class="font-italic">Fehily </span>is consistent with the statutory one in ss 4(1) and 5(1) of Singapore’s MCA. Aedit Abdullah J also confirmed in <span class="font-italic">BUV v BUU and another and another matter</span> [2019] SGHCF 15 at [31] that the absence of any one cognitive function in s 5(1) (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to use or weigh information to make a decision) will result in a finding of incapacity.

Where the document is actually explained to the party in question, the court should consider if such explanation imparted the requisite degree of understanding of the document such that the party’s signature represents his/her consent to the contract (<span class="font-italic">Ford </span>at [12] and [85]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Third, Lord Reid did not expound on what “any real understanding” entails.

Mr Vincent Yeoh’s (second defendant’s counsel) (“Mr Yeoh”) preceding question concerned the second defendant directly, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, whether someone talking to the second defendant would suspect that something is amiss about his mind. It is also clear from Mr Yeoh’s response, “Okay, I think I know where you are coming from.

In the absence of any authority on the proper procedure for bringing such a challenge, I take reference from <span class="font-italic">Chan Kok Kiang v Tan Swan Cheng and another</span> [1968-1970] SLR(R) 707 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Kok Kiang</span>”). That case involved an application, on appeal, to amend the Notes of Evidence of the trial by adding in a note taken by one of the appellant’s/defendant’s counsel at trial. The Court of Appeal’s guidance on the procedure for bringing such an application is instructive for our purposes (<span class="font-italic">Chan Kok Kiang</span> at [6]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If it is intended that any note taken by counsel at the trial of an action be accepted as part of the notes of evidence for use by an appellate court, it is desirable that the trial judge and counsel for the other party or parties should be supplied at the <span class="font-italic">earliest possible opportunity</span> with a copy of the note so made for correction or acceptance or otherwise. If the trial judge and counsel for all parties <span class="font-italic">agree</span> to the original or a corrected version then such agreed original or corrected version can properly be included in the record of appeal as part of the notes of evidence. Where no version can be so agreed, then in any application for leave to include the note made or taken by counsel at the trial, the <span class="font-italic">affidavit</span> in support of the application ought to set out the circumstances under which the note was made or taken and the steps taken to obtain the agreement of all concerned together with all correspondence relating to the attempt to obtain such agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The appellant’s application in that case was rejected because it was brought at a very late stage in the proceedings and the trial judge and the respondent’s counsel were <span class="font-italic">unable to verify</span> whether the note sought to be introduced was an accurate verbatim record of what the trial judge had said at the trial (<span class="font-italic">Chan Kok Kiang</span> at [7]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In light of the principles in <span class="font-italic">Chan Kok Kiang</span>, the second defendant should have scrutinised the Official Transcript and given the court and opposing counsel written notice of his intention to challenge the Official Transcript at the earliest possible opportunity (“Written Notice”). The Written Notice should have stated his belief that the Official Transcript was wrong and the basis for this belief, so as to enable the court to reach a decision on how to progress the matter. If the plaintiff’s agreement to amend the record was not forthcoming, parties’ should have, once again, written in to the court, which may then have taken the option of re-calling Professor Kua.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In this case, the second defendant’s failure to provide the court or opposing counsel with a Written Notice and prematurely contacting Professor Kua prior to receiving the court’s directions on this issue removed the option of recalling Professor Kua as a witness. What is also inexplicable is how the second defendant was prepared to mount the present challenge before even obtaining the audio recording of the proceedings; the audio recording was only requested by the plaintiff on 30 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Having reviewed the audio transcript of the trial proceedings, and considering the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua’s testimony in their context, I am unable to verify the accuracy of the second defendant’s proposed alterations and dismiss his challenge to the Official Transcript.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 However, even if I am wrong and the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua’s testimony are indeed inaccurate, this does not affect my decision. For the following reasons, I do not think that the Challenged Portions of Professor Kua’s testimony have a material bearing on whether the second defendant possessed the ability to understand the Guarantee <span class="font-italic">with </span>proper explanations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 First, the First and Second Challenged Portions of Professor Kua’s testimony (see [117] above) do not concern the Guarantee; they concern the LOA, OTP and SD. In fact, just before the First Challenged Portion of Professor Kua’s testimony, Professor Kua recounted the second defendant as saying “Oh, I understand, right” when he was shown his signature on the LOA, OTP and SD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Second, when Professor Kua showed the second defendant the LOA on 19 July 2017, he claims to have explained it to the second defendant in Hokkien. However, no evidence was led as to how such explanations were phrased.

However, he assessed the second defendant to be unable to “weigh information” in order to “make decisions in his best interest” and hence mentally incapacitated.

Bearing in mind Professor Kua’s caution that the <span class="font-italic">consequences</span> of the Guarantee must be “clearly” explained, and as I subsequently address at [138] and [142], in the circumstances of this case, the explanation is “proper” if it is clear and captures the key feature(s) of the document (<span class="font-italic">Fehily </span>at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 A preliminary issue that arises is whether Mr Ong explained the Guarantee in <span class="font-italic">both</span> English and Mandarin.

</div> The second defendant need not have understood every ancillary or procedural aspect of the Guarantee. Instead, if Mr Ong’s explanations were sufficient to give the second defendant an understanding of the key features of the Guarantee (<span class="font-italic">Fehily</span> at [101]), such that the second defendant would be alive to the “fundamental difference between the actual document and the document as [he] had believed it to be”, this would defeat the plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> (<span class="font-italic">Saunders</span> at 1034). In light of the evidence, I am satisfied that Mr Ong’s explanations in English and Mandarin captured the key features of the Guarantee, namely, that the second defendant would become personally responsible to repay all outstanding amounts under the Loan Agreement if the first defendant failed to do so (Clauses 1 and 2 of the Guarantee).

This is not inconsistent with my earlier finding that the Loan Agreement is a sham as the plaintiff would have sought to clothe the Guarantee with legitimacy by ensuring it was formally and appropriately executed (see [43] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evaluation of the evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In light of the expert evidence, Mr Ong’s explanations and the exceptional nature of the <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> doctrine, I am not satisfied that the second defendant’s ability to understand the Guarantee was impeded to the extent required under <span class="font-italic">Saunders</span> (see [109] and [112] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In fact, the second defendant’s Mental Capacity Affidavit affirmed on 7 July 2017 casts further doubt on his assertion that he misunderstood or was unable to understand the Guarantee, especially given Mr Fernandez’s testimony that he drafted the Mental Capacity Affidavit on the second defendant’s instructions (see [95] and [96] above).

</div> The most crucial difference is that the mortgagor in <span class="font-italic">Ford</span> (at [85]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… could not have understood either document <span class="font-italic">if it had been read to him</span>…; no explanation of the documents signed by [the mortgagor] would have been adequate to provide him with an understanding or appreciation of their true meaning or effect even at a basic or visceral level and that [the mortgagor] did not understand the loan agreement or mortgage at the time he entered them or at the trial …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 It bears emphasising that Professor Kua accepted the probability of the second defendant understanding the documents despite having found that the second defendant was mentally incapacitated in his 2017 and 2019 reports (see [115] above). In the same vein, it is implicit from Lord Reid’s statement of the law in <span class="font-italic">Saunders </span>(see [109] above) that mental incapacity does not necessarily establish a plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. Lord Pearson appears to have made the same point by pronouncing on the degree to which one’s ability to understand the document signed must be impaired by “permanent or temporary reasons (not limited to blindness or illiteracy)” (see [112] above) before a plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> will succeed. Indeed, the distinction between the defences of mental incapacity and <span class="font-italic">non est factum </span>should be maintained so as not to render the former otiose. It is therefore clear that the Family Justice Court’s order declaring the second defendant mentally incapacitated on 30 October 2017 does not preclude a finding that he was able to understand the Guarantee sufficiently on 22 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 For completeness, I did not take into consideration the reports of Dr Tan and Dr Leong, which both certified the second defendant as possessing mental capacity, when arriving at my decision on this issue as they are inadmissible hearsay evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second element of non est factum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Parties who seek to invoke <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> on the basis of their innate incapacity, illness or defective education must still take “such precautions as they reasonably can” (<span class="font-italic">Saunders</span> at 1016). Given my conclusion in respect of the first element, it is unnecessary for me to make a finding in respect of this second element of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>. Suffice to say that it does not go in the second defendant’s favour that he failed to obtain independent advice on the Guarantee before signing it, despite his appointment of counsel for other affairs such as the replacement of the title deeds of the Rangoon Road Property, sale of the Rangoon Road Property, or challenging his family’s MCA application (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, FC/OSM 214/2017) and applying to set aside an interim injunction prohibiting the sale of the Rangoon Road Property.

However, as the second defendant did not take this up in his submissions, I make no finding on the LOA.
