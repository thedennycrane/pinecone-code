Although named as a defendant, Ideal Design Studio is the subject of only a relatively small claim by the plaintiff. As far as the oppression claim is concerned, it is a nominal party.

On the contrary, the evidence shows that the agreement with respect to the plaintiff’s commission was reached around the time that he joined Ideal Design Studio (see [9]–[10] above) and was in terms which the plaintiff could well understand without any need for legal advice.

One may take this as suggesting that the plaintiff was jointly responsible with Mr Ng for bringing in this project and, perhaps, that he ought to be paid a commission of 25% of the profit. But that is not the plaintiff’s case. I note also that the job sheet records that Mr Ng was entitled to and has been paid for his role as a salesperson, albeit a sum which is less than 50% of the profit.

But <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 at [77] clarified that the limbs of s 216 are bound by the common thread of unfairness. Hence, a complainant does not need to identify which ground of oppression he is relying on. Instead, the touchstone for minority oppression is whether the conduct being complained of is commercially unfair (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [81]). Commercial unfairness arises when there has been “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect” (see <span class="font-italic">Re Kong Thai Sawmill (</span><span class="font-italic">Miri) Sdn Bhd </span>[1978] 2 MLJ 227 at 229 as cited in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [77]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The law adopts a contextual approach in ascertaining commercial unfairness.

Unfairness can thus be discerned either from a course of conduct or even from a single act (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [74]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 A distinction must also be drawn between unfairness and unlawfulness. A person may act within his legal rights and yet act in a manner which is commercially unfair. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> at [78], the law on s 216 looks not only at a person’s legal rights but also at the legitimate expectations of the company’s members. The converse is also true. Unlawful conduct that is of a technical nature, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a trivial breach of a director’s duties, is not necessarily commercially unfair (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Wah and others v Lim Boh Yong and others and other matters </span>[2015] 5 SLR 307<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100]). In the final analysis, whether an act is commercially unfair depends on the context in which the act took place. That includes, but goes beyond, the issue of whether the act is lawful or regular.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Equitable considerations and legitimate expectations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In every case in which oppression is alleged, the first step is to examine whether the court ought to superimpose equitable considerations that would make a party’s exercise of his strict legal rights commercially unfair under certain circumstances (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Wah </span>at [102]). To answer this question, the court looks at various factors. These include the nature of the company and the shareholders’ relationship. Equitable considerations may be superimposed in situations where, for example, the company was formed on the basis of personal relationships involving mutual trust and confidence (see <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Westbourne Galleries Ltd </span>[1973] AC 360 at 379E as cited in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Wah </span>at [105]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In this connection, the law subjects certain companies that are formed or managed on the basis of mutual trust and confidence to greater scrutiny (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [83]). Such companies are known as quasi-partnerships. A quasi-partnership may now be said to be any company whose affairs are conducted with a degree of informality, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the members do not transact on an arms-length basis, do not distil their informal agreements into formal contracts, and do not record their understandings in writing. The informal nature in which such companies conduct their internal affairs creates a greater risk that some members will be victims of exploitative conduct by the majority. The law is hence more willing to scrutinise the parties’ past conduct and communications to determine if there are any informal agreements or understandings between the parties which form the context for considering whether specific conduct is or is not commercially unfair. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [83], the minority in quasi-partnerships tend to “[operate] on the belief that the majority would take their interests into account and that any such problems would be readily and civilly ironed out”. Therefore, in such cases, the court “will insist upon a high standard of corporate governance” (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 That is not to suggest that a minority oppression claim can succeed only where equitable considerations are superimposed or where the court finds that the company is a quasi-partnership. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span> (Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh, and Lee Pey Woan eds) (Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 11.059, s 216 of the Act is wide enough to encompass companies of different types. But a claim in minority oppression is often more difficult to establish where no equitable considerations are superimposed. This is because in the absence of equitable considerations, the unfairness of a party’s conduct must be measured against legitimate expectations arising from the members’ legal rights and the company’s constitution (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Wah </span>at [106]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of Ideal Design Studio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having set out the law, I now consider whether equitable considerations should be superimposed on Ideal Design Studio. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this regard, Mr Tayabali submits that Ideal Design Studio is a quasi-partnership because the plaintiff reposed trust and confidence in the defendants.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Moreover, the examples cited by Mr Tayabali do not support his argument that Ideal Design Studio is a quasi-partnership. Just because the plaintiff allowed the defendants to have joint control over the company’s bank account does not necessarily suggest that there was mutual trust and confidence. It can just as easily be interpreted to mean that there was <span class="font-italic">no </span>mutual trust and confidence between the three of them. If there had indeed been mutual trust and confidence, the plaintiff would also have been granted control over the company’s bank account. Similarly, the fact that the plaintiff joined Ideal Design Studio <span class="font-italic">before</span> resigning his previous employment can equally be taken to suggest that he did not have the confidence in the defendants to join the company without still being tethered to his previous place of employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, I find that Ideal Design Studio is not a quasi-partnership on which equitable considerations can be superimposed.

</div> In other words, the defendants acted well within their legal rights as shareholders in removing the plaintiff as a director. In the light of this, the only remaining way in which this act could constitute oppression under s 216 is if the plaintiff had a legitimate expectation that he would be included in the management of Ideal Design Studio.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I pause here to note that the use of the term “legitimate expectations” in this context is apt to mislead unless it is analysed closely. It does not mean a party’s self-engendered expectation of inclusion in management. It certainly does not mean an expectation of inclusion in management which arises after the fact, when the parties are engaged in a dispute. Neither type of expectation is what is meant by a legitimate expectation of inclusion in management. What is needed is an agreement – using the term in its broadest sense – between the parties by way of words or conduct which gives rise to an expectation that the plaintiff will be included in management (see <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Phillips and others</span> [1999] 2 All ER 961 at 969h). The plaintiff therefore needs to produce evidence of words or conduct between the parties which show an agreement in the broadest sense that he would be included in management and from which the defendants have departed unfairly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the evidence, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there were any such words or conduct. First, there is nothing in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief to suggest that the defendants agreed to the plaintiff being included in the management of Ideal Design Studio by their words or conduct.

</div> The defendants certainly did not agree that the plaintiff was to be included in management. Third, the only informal agreement which appears on the evidence militates against any expectation that the plaintiff would be included in management. It bears recalling that the plaintiff became a shareholder and a director in the company on the basis that he would generate $200,000 in sales within six months, failing which would cease voluntarily to be a shareholder and a director (see [11]–[12] above). This reinforces the second defendant’s evidence that the plaintiff’s agreed role in the company was to be a salesman and also perhaps to manage projects, but did not extend to managing the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Additionally, Mr Tayabali argues that a minority shareholder who renders services to a company and earns an income from doing so is oppressed for the purposes of s 216 of the Act when the opportunity to continue doing so is taken away from him by the majority.

</div> In my view, this submission does not take the plaintiff’s case very far. There is no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff had a legitimate expectation that he should have or be entitled to retain the opportunity to sell his labour to Ideal Design Studio. The mere fact that the plaintiff actually did earn an income from Ideal Design Studio by selling his labour to it does not, without more, make it oppressive for the majority subsequently to deprive him of that opportunity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this respect, Mr Tayabali’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Tullio</span><span class="font-italic"> Planeta v Maoro Andrea G </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 501 is misconceived. In that case, a shareholder who owned half the shares in the company was excluded from management. This was contrary to a partly-oral and partly-written agreement that he and the other shareholder would share the management of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Tullio</span> at [3]). This was found at first instance to constitute oppression. This finding was not disturbed on appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Tullio</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14]). <span class="font-italic">Tullio</span> therefore stands for the proposition that exclusion from management can be the basis for oppression where there is an agreement – again using that term in its broadest sense – to the contrary.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In this case, there is no such agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Accordingly, I find that removing the plaintiff as a director of Ideal Design Studio and excluding him from the management of Ideal Design Studio do not amount to oppression.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Diversion of business from Ideal Design Studio</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Diversion of business as an oppressive act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The third and final ground of oppression alleged by the plaintiff concerns the incorporation of the five Ideal Design companies and the defendants’ conduct in deliberately diverting business from Ideal Design Studio to these five other companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I begin by noting the well-established principle that the directors of a company have a fiduciary duty to act in its best interests. It follows from this that shareholders have a legitimate expectation that those in control of the company will act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interests of the company. That is especially so when the majority shareholders are themselves the directors. These propositions were set out clearly by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison. </span>In that case, he observed that, as a starting point, the legitimate expectations of shareholders must be analysed against the company’s constitution and the fiduciary duties imposed by the law (see <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison </span>at 18):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Since keeping promises and honouring agreements is probably the most important element of commercial fairness, the starting point in any case under s 459 [equivalent to s 216 of the Act] will be to ask <span class="font-italic">whether the conduct of which the shareholder complains was in accordance with the articles of association</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The answer to this question often turns on the fact that the powers which the shareholders have entrusted to the board are fiduciary powers, which must be exercised for the benefit of the company as a whole. If the board act for some ulterior purpose, they <span class="font-italic">step outside the terms of the bargain between the shareholders and the company</span>. … [T]he fact that the board are protected by the principle of majority rule does not necessarily prevent their conduct from being unfair within the meaning of s 459. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Whether there has been a breach of a director’s fiduciary duties is thus a relevant, but not determinative, consideration in deciding whether there has been oppressive conduct. In this respect, those in control of a company must act with valid commercial reasons when pursuing a company’s best interests. As held in <span class="font-italic">Intraco</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at [29], the test is whether an honest and intelligent person in the position of the directors could objectively and reasonably conclude that the impugned acts were in the interests of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I turn now to focus specifically on conduct involving the diversion of business. It has been observed that such acts are “[p]erhaps the most singularly censurable form of oppressive conduct” (see <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders </span>at 181). The majority’s conduct in diverting business away from a company in which a complainant has a minority shareholding, without adequate justification, constitutes unfair prejudice in English law (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">In re London School of Electronics Ltd </span>[1986] Ch 211). The same applies in Singapore, where it has been held that it can be oppressive conduct under s 216 of the Act for a majority shareholder to favour another company to the detriment of the company in which a minority has his shareholding (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Khiang </span>at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In this case, the defendants argue that they incorporated the five Ideal Design companies and diverted business away from Ideal Design Studio for valid commercial reasons.

The evidence does not support the claim. It is true that the result of incorporating the five companies was to put at the defendants’ disposal six ostensibly separate legal entities to service their customers. But the defendants ran Ideal Design Studio and the five other companies essentially as a single business. A number of facts point to this conclusion. First, the companies shared a common pool of designers.

If a particular company’s revenue was in danger of hitting the $1m mark, the defendants would simply direct the contract to another company (see [18] above). There is no evidence to support the second defendant’s claim that the addition of the five Ideal Design companies gave the customers more choice in any meaningful way. Certainly, the second defendant admitted that customers would be concerned only about the salesperson and designer assigned to a renovation project, and not about the specific company that the defendants nominated to be the customer’s counterparty.

</div> This explanation is not mentioned in her affidavit of evidence in chief. Instead, her evidence in chief is simply that the defendants decided to incorporate another company to “expand the business”. All of this suggests that GST registration was not the real reason the defendants incorporated the five companies and diverted Ideal Design Studio’s business to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Moreover, even if the true reason behind the diversion of business was to keep costs low by avoiding the need to charge customers GST, honest and intelligent directors in the defendants’ position could not reasonably have seen the diversion as being in the best interests of Ideal Design Studio. It bears emphasising the obvious: Ideal Design Studio is a legal entity distinct from the other five companies. The evidence before me does not suggest that Ideal Design Studio – as opposed to the defendants personally – derived any benefit from the diversion of its business to the other companies. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the effect of defendants’ scheme was deliberately to cap Ideal Design Studio’s yearly revenue at $1m (see [18] above). In this connection, I note that the position might be different if all six companies had precisely the same shareholders or were part of a group of companies. But that is not the case. Even then, while controllers of a group of companies may consider the entire group’s best interests in making decisions, they are not entitled to sacrifice the interests of one company in the group (see <span class="font-italic">Cha</span><span class="font-italic">rterbridge Corporation Ltd v Lloyds Bank Ltd and another </span>[1970] Ch 62 at 74 as cited in <span class="font-italic">Intraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28]). In this case, it is apparent that the only parties who derived a benefit from the diversion of business are the defendants personally, in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the five Ideal Design companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For the above reasons, I do not accept the defendants’ evidence that they diverted business from Ideal Design Studio for valid commercial reasons. In this vein, the timing and circumstances under which the five companies were incorporated are noteworthy. The first of the companies, Ideal Design Renovation Pte Ltd was incorporated just over a month after the plaintiff had been removed as a director and just over two months after he had refused to sell back his shares.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 At this juncture, I pause to address the parties’ understanding that the plaintiff would resign as a director and sell back his shares to the second defendant if he failed to achieve $200,000 in sales within his first six months (see [11] above). While it may be true that the plaintiff refused to sell back his shares, this did not entitle the defendants to approximate the effect of his doing so by incorporating the five companies and diverting business from Ideal Design Studio to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The case of <span class="font-italic">Spectramed</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lek Puay Puay and others and another suit </span>[2011] SGHC 43 is illuminating on this point. There, Lai Siu Chiu J found that the managing director had breached her duties as a director by diverting business to another company (at [128]). But she also found that the managing director, who was a minority shareholder, was a victim of oppressive conduct by the majority (at [131]–[132]). Lai J remarked that, even if the managing director had felt aggrieved by the oppressive acts, that did not excuse the breaches of her fiduciary duties to the company (at 128]). <span class="font-italic">Spectramed</span> therefore stands for the proposition that the law does not, and should not, condone a tit-for-tat approach to shareholder relations. If the defendants felt aggrieved by the plaintiff’s refusal to sell back his shares and abide by their original understanding, they were entitled to remove him as a director and to exclude him from management, as I have found. Beyond that, they could have continued to engage him in negotiations to buy over his shares. They could not, however, in effect devalue his shareholding by diverting commercial opportunities, which should have been exploited by Ideal Design Studio for the benefit of all of its shareholders, to five companies in which they alone had an interest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In sum, I find that the defendants’ real reason for incorporating the five companies was to divert the revenue, and therefore also the profits, of what would otherwise have been Ideal Design Studio’s business to entities in which the plaintiff had no shareholding and accordingly no legal entitlement to share in the profits. The diversion was without any valid commercial reason. It was thus contrary to the best interests of Ideal Design Studio.  The diversion was not only a breach of their fiduciary duties to Ideal Design Studio. It was grossly commercially unfair to the plaintiff as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio. The defendants thereby defeated the plaintiff’s legitimate expectation as a shareholder, and are thus guilty of oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 216 of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">A question of reflective loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Having found that the defendants’ diversion of business is a wrong against both the plaintiff and Ideal Design Studio, a question that arises is whether the plaintiff is entitled to seek relief under s 216 of the Act which has the result of compensating him for the diminution in the value of his shares caused by a wrong done to the company. This question arises because the relief sought by the plaintiff is a buyout of his shares at a price which assumes that the diversion of business did not take place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In this regard, Mr Singh’s argument is that the plaintiff’s action for minority oppression on the basis of diversion of business is an abuse of the oppression remedy under s 216 of the Act. Citing <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 723 and <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span><span class="font-italic"> Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 597, Mr Singh submits that the plaintiff is using s 216 to pursue a remedy for what is in essence a wrong to the company.

</div> He argues that the direct consequence of the defendants’ diversion of business was a loss of profits suffered by Ideal Design Studio. Any loss for which the plaintiff is compensated in a buyout for the diminution in the value of his shares by reason of this diversion is merely a loss which is reflective of Ideal Design Studio’s losses. Reflective loss of this nature is irrecoverable in an action brought by a shareholder. The plaintiff ought instead to have sought leave to commence a statutory derivative action against the defendants in the name of Ideal Design Studio under s 216A of the Act.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I accept that part of the purchase price which the defendants will have to pay to the plaintiff for his shares will reflect a part of the loss of profits suffered by Ideal Design Studio as a result of the defendants’ diversion of business. But I disagree with Mr Singh that the plaintiff’s action under s 216 of the Act is, for that reason, an abuse of process. It is not always the case that a minority shareholder’s action for a personal statutory remedy for oppression is an abuse of process simply because the very same conduct which has been found to be oppressive is simultaneously a wrong occasioned to the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I take as my starting point the Victorian case of <span class="font-italic">Foss v </span><span class="font-italic">Harbottle </span>(1843) 2 Hare 461. The rule in that case is that only a company can sue for losses that it has suffered, because a company is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders (see <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee </span>at [61]). This is the well known proper plaintiff rule. But there are exceptions to it. One of those is the statutory derivative action under s 216A of the Act. This provision enables a shareholder to seek leave to bring an action in the company’s name for a wrong occasioned to the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The bar on recovering reflective loss is the other side of the proper plaintiff rule. It provides that a person may not initiate an action to recover a loss which he has suffered by virtue of a diminution in the value of his shares in a company which merely reflects the company’s own loss and for which the company can be made whole if it were to pursue its rights against the party responsible for that loss (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm) </span>[2002] 2 AC 1 at 35 and <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee </span>at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Taken together, the proper plaintiff principle and the reflective loss principle establish a conceptual distinction between personal rights and corporate rights. A breach of a right vested in a shareholder ought to be vindicated at the suit of the shareholder, whereas a breach of a right vested in the company ought to be vindicated at the suit of the company. Accordingly, a shareholder’s attempt to use s 216 of the Act to vindicate a right vested in the company – such as a company’s rights against a director who has breached his fiduciary duties to the company – could be considered an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Further, as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee </span>at [65], this difference between how corporate and personal rights ought to be vindicated is not just a matter of procedural propriety but also reflects a number of important policy considerations. When a minority shareholder seeks an oppression remedy against the majority to vindicate what is in truth a corporate right, he does so to the potential prejudice of other minority shareholders. Their interests will inevitably be affected by any personal remedy granted to the minority shareholder even if they were not parties to the oppression and indeed even if they might have been victims of the same oppression but have decided to respond to it differently. In the same vein, it is also patently desirable to prevent a multiplicity of actions or the risk of double recovery against the wrongdoer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 That being said, there are often overlaps between personal rights and corporate rights. It is not uncommon for acts which are alleged to be oppressive also to constitute a wrong to the company (see Pearlie Koh, “The Shareholder’s Personal Claim: Allowing Recovery for Reflective Losses” (2011) 23 SAcLJ 863 (“<span class="font-italic">Shareholder’s Personal Claim</span>”) at para 52). For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Khiang</span>, the Court of Appeal found that the majority shareholders who exercised control over the company’s management had acted oppressively by failing to terminate a licence and to collect royalties owed to the company. The respondents’ failure in this regard was found to have been a “dereliction of their duties as directors” (at [45]) and “was detrimental to the commercial interests of [the company] and therefore in disregard of the appellants’ minority shareholding interests” (at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It is thus clear that an application under s 216 of the Act will not be an abuse of process just because the oppressive conduct also happens to constitute a wrong to the company. In this respect, the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee </span>is instructive. There, the complainant shareholder held approximately 54% of the shares in the company while the alleged wrongdoer held 15%. The wrongdoer was appointed the managing director of the company. He was found to have mismanaged the affairs of the company and to have wrongly enriched himself (see [38]–[45]). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that the complainant was not entitled to bring an action under s 216 of the Act because it was within its power as the majority shareholder to take control of the company’s management (see [55]–[59]). This was sufficient to dispose of the matter. But the Court of Appeal also opined that the complainant’s action was essentially for a wrong to the company and should have been pursued by way of a statutory derivative action under s 216A of the Act (see [71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In reaching its conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee</span>, the Court of Appeal endorsed (at [68]) the decision of Millet J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) </span>[1990] BCLC 760. Millet J there articulated the importance of ascertaining the true nature<span class="font-italic"> </span>of a complaint in determining whether an action is more appropriately brought for minority oppression or by way of a derivative action (see 784):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The very same facts may well found either a derivative action or a s 459 petition [equivalent to s 216 of the Act]. But that should not disguise the fact that the nature of the complaint and the appropriate relief is different in the two cases. Had the petitioners’ true complaint been of the unlawfulness of the respondent’s conduct, so that it would have been met by an order for restitution, then a derivative action would have been appropriate and a s 459 petition would not. <span class="font-italic">But that was not the true nature of the petitioners’ complaint</span>. They did not rely on the unlawfulness of the respondent’s conduct to found their cause of action; and they <span class="font-italic">would not have been content with an order that the respondent make restitution to the company</span>. They relied on the respondent’s unlawful conduct as evidence of the manner in which he had conducted the company’s affairs for his own benefit and in disregard of their interests as minority shareholders; and they <span class="font-italic">wanted to be bought out</span>. They wanted <span class="font-italic">relief from mismanagement, not a remedy for misconduct</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 After considering the above passage, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee</span> stated <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>at [69] that there are two considerations to be taken into account when determining whether an action has been properly brought under s 216 of the Act when the conduct complained of amounts to a breach of both personal and corporate rights. First, whether the unlawfulness of the wrongdoer’s conduct is being relied on as evidence of how the alleged wrongdoer disregarded the complainant’s interest as a minority shareholder. Second, whether the complaint is such that it cannot be adequately addressed by the remedy that the law has provided for that wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It has also been suggested that the court should consider whether the policy concerns which underlie the principle barring recovery of reflective loss would be contravened by permitting a shareholder to pursue an action for personal loss (see <span class="font-italic">Shareholder’s Personal Claim </span>generally). Thus, for example, where there is no danger of double recovery or prejudice to other shareholders, a complainant should not be prevented from pursuing a personal claim under s 216 of the Act. This approach finds support in <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span><span class="font-italic"> Henry George</span>, where the Court of Appeal dealt with a claim in relation to a director’s breach of his duties that resulted in losses to the company and a diminution in the value of the complainant’s shares. There, the Court of Appeal suggested <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>at [85]–[86]<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the complainant would not have contravened the reflective loss principle if it had adduced evidence or procured an undertaking from other interested parties to satisfy the court that there was no danger of double recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To summarise, the following propositions are to be borne in mind on an application under s 216 of the Act where the principle barring recovery of reflective loss is raised:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The same acts can be oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 216 of the Act and also a breach of duty owed to the company. It is not invariably the case that a shareholder should be barred from pursuing a remedy for the oppressive conduct by an application under s 216 just because the compensation to be awarded to him, if he succeeds, will reflect in whole or in part the loss suffered by the company by the breach of duty owed to the company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In ascertaining whether the shareholder is barred from seeking relief under s 216, the court must determine the true nature of the shareholder’s complaint and the essence of the relief sought by the complainant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An application under s 216 will be appropriate where the unlawfulness of the wrongdoer’s conduct is merely used as evidence of the wrongdoer’s disregard of the complainant’s interest as a shareholder and where the complaint cannot be adequately addressed by the remedy provided by law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Another important consideration is whether the policy concerns underlying the reflective loss principle would be contravened if the complainant is allowed to pursue a personal action under s 216. If there is no such danger, then any insistence on complying strictly with the reflective principle loses much of its force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Applying these principles to this case, it is plain to me that the reflective loss principle is no bar either to the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief under s 216 of the Act or to the specific type of relief which the plaintiff seeks. Although the defendants’ diversion of Ideal Design Studio’s business is a breach of the fiduciary duties which they owe to the company, such conduct also constitutes evidence of their complete disregard of the plaintiff’s interest as a minority shareholder. Further, while the plaintiff could have brought a derivative action under s 216A, that would not have adequately addressed his ultimate complaint and his primary relief, which is to be allowed to withdraw his capital and exit Ideal Design Studio by having his shares bought out by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In addition, there is no danger of causing prejudice to any other shareholder in Ideal Design Studio by ordering the defendants to buy the plaintiff’s shares on the terms that he seeks. All three of Ideal Design Studio’s shareholders are now before me. There are therefore no third party shareholders whose interests may be affected by valuing the plaintiff’s shares at the value they would have but for the defendants’ conduct in diverting Ideal Design Studio’s business to the five companies. And as observed in <span class="font-italic">Shareholder’s Personal Claim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 16, “the need to protect the interests of other shareholders does not arise where… all the other shareholders are themselves defendants”. Accordingly, I find that the reflective loss principle bars neither the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief under s 216 nor the nature of the relief which the plaintiff seeks.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate relief</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The final issue is the relief that that should be granted. In this regard, the plaintiff seeks a buyout of his shares in Ideal Design Studio. He also desires for his shares to be valued on the assumption that the defendants had not diverted the company’s business.

</div> Mr Singh agrees that the valuation of the plaintiff’s shares should be on the basis that he owns 16.67% of not only Ideal Design Studio, but also of the other five Ideal Design companies.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Section 216 of the Act confers on the court wide powers to provide relief with the goal of bringing an end or remedying the matters complained of (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Khiang </span>at [91]). In this case, it is patent that the parties’ relationship has broken down irretrievably such that they can no longer hold shares in the same company. The defendants no longer wish to have the plaintiff as a shareholder or a director of Ideal Design Studio.  That is why they put pressure on him to sell his shares to them and why they removed him as a director when he refused (see [13]–[15] above). By the same token, the plaintiff no longer wishes to be a shareholder of Ideal Design Studio. That is why he has commenced these proceedings asking, amongst other things, for the defendants to be ordered to by his shares. Therefore, the most appropriate remedy is to have the defendants purchase the plaintiff’s shareholding in Ideal Design Studio. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 With regard to the question of how the plaintiff’s shares should be valued, it bears emphasising that the court is not bound by strict accounting principles. Its role is to “determine a price that is fair and just in the particular circumstances of the case” (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo Hung </span><span class="font-italic">Khiang v Dickson Investment (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 773 at [72]). In this case, I am of the view that it would be fair and just to value the plaintiff’s shares on the assumption that the business that was diverted to the five Ideal Design companies had gone to Ideal Design Studio instead. To do otherwise would allow the defendants to achieve the oppressive purpose for which they incorporated the five companies and diverted Ideal Design Studio’s business to them. I also consider that the plaintiffs’ shares ought to be valued as at 5 January 2009, which is the day before Ideal Design Renovation Pte Ltd was incorporated.
