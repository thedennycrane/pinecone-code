At all material times, the sole shareholder and director of ECPL was (and still is) Vu Xuan Thu (“the Second defendant” or “VXT”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 D&amp;N Trading &amp; Consultancy Limited (“D&amp;N”) is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands which the plaintiff alleges is controlled by VXT who it asserts is the company’s <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> as VXT is its sole shareholder and director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Dinh Thi Hoang Uyen (“the Fourth defendant” or “Dinh”) is the wife of VXT. She was joined as a party to these proceedings by an order of court dated 11 April 2019.  Immediately thereafter on the same day, the plaintiff obtained a worldwide <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction against her under order of court 2480/2019 (“the Second <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> order”). Prior thereto, a similar injunction had been obtained against ECPL, VXT and D&amp;N on 15 March 2019 under order of court 1821/2019 (“the First <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> order”). Both injunctions were for values up to USD10,291,782.00.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In fact, the plaintiff obtained innumerable orders of court against all four defendants in the course of these proceedings. Some of the orders of court obtained are the subject matter of these grounds of decision. The defendants’ attempts to set aside and/or vary the two <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunctions were dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 After obtaining leave of court on 28 August 2020, the plaintiff applied by way of Summons No 3689 of 2020 (“the Committal Application”) for VXT personally and as a director of ECPL and D&amp;N together with Dinh, to be committed to prison for contempt of court in failing to comply with numerous orders of court. The plaintiff alleged that VXT failed to comply with five orders of court requiring disclosure of documents from him whilst Dinh was alleged to have failed to comply with three orders of court that similarly required disclosure from her. VXT and Dinh were unsuccessful in their attempts to set aside the various orders of court for discovery made against them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Separately, the plaintiff applied by way of Summons No 3388 of 2020 (“the Striking Out Application”) for the Defences and/or Counterclaim of ECPL, VXT and Dinh to be struck out and for interlocutory judgment to be entered against ECPL and VXT in the plaintiff’s favour (with costs and damages to be assessed). The plaintiff also applied for interlocutory judgment in default of defence against D&amp;N (with costs and damages to be assessed) and for final judgment (with costs) to be entered against Dinh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 After a lengthy hearing of both Summonses, this court granted the Committal Application (“the Committal Order”) as well as the Striking Out Application on 27 October 2020, both with suspension orders. All four defendants have appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No 187 of 2020) after first obtaining a stay of execution on 30 October 2020 against the same.  I now set out the reasons for the orders that I granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3

those monies had been used to pay her “creditors".</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Provide an affidavit in accordance with her disclosure requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Committal Application was supported by the second affidavit filed by the plaintiff’s director Vincent Andre R. Lison (“Lison”) on 12 August 2020 (“Lison’s second affidavit”). Lison’s second affidavit detailed the defendants’ breaches as set out at [9] and [10] above as well as the facts and reasons that led to the Committal Application being filed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I should state at this juncture that the plaintiff’s claims against ECPL, VXT and D&amp;N were <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> for unlawful conspiracy alleging that the three defendants chartered the plaintiff’s vessel, the motor tanker Christina (“the vessel”), to smuggle cargo in particular gasoil, into Vietnam. As a result, the vessel was implicated in a criminal act under Vietnamese law. The vessel was detained in Vietnam for three years from 30 January 2016 to 28 January 2019 causing loss and damage to the plaintiff of at least USD10m.  In fact, the vessel’s master was prosecuted and convicted of giving false information in the cargo import declaration form that was prepared by ECPL’s local shipping agent. The plaintiff contended that the master was duped into signing the aforesaid form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The plaintiff’s claim against Dinh was on the basis that she held funds and assets that in truth and in fact belonged to the other three defendants or any of them. The plaintiff therefore sought <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> a declaration against her that all her assets or a substantial part thereof are liable to execution by the plaintiff if it succeeds in its claim against VXT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the course of the criminal proceedings in Vietnam, a Vietnamese court had issued a decision on 21 December 2018 detailing how a Vietnamese company called Duong Dong Hoa Phu Joint Stock Company (“DDHP”) had been smuggling gasoline from foreign companies like ECPL and D&amp;N into Vietnam from October 2015 to January 2016 and had paid D&amp;N approximately USD9m for the smuggled gasoil. In this regard, the ex-general manager of DDHP (“the ex-GM”) had been convicted and imprisoned for his role in the smuggling operation. The ex-GM had admitted that for cargo declared to the Vietnamese customs authorities, payment by DDHP to D&amp;N would be by letters of credit and bank transfers but for cargo that was not so declared but smuggled into Vietnam, DDHP would pay D&amp;N in cash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Because of what the ex-GM revealed, the plaintiff sought discovery from ECPL, VXT and D&amp;N of all their correspondence with DDHP and their payment records. The plaintiff discovered that the few documents provided to the plaintiff by VXT were discrepant with payments received by VXT, ECPL and D&amp;N from DDHP for the gasoil sold to DDHP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It was the plaintiff’s case that the dealings between the first to third defendants and DDHP were neither arm’s length nor <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and that their contracts with DDHP were sham documents intended to conceal the smuggling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Consequently, the plaintiff mounted a rigorous specific discovery process against the first three defendants (essentially against VXT as the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> of the two corporate entities) for documents and details of contract amendments and discussions between the three defendants and DDHP that would explain the true nature of their dealings and the discrepancies in the payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 However, VXT continued to be evasive and obstructive when it came to the further discovery sought despite two court orders that required the first three defendants to disclose their handphones, computer hard drives and email accounts for forensic examination. According to the plaintiff, the first three defendants went to great lengths and concocted (through VXT) the most absurd excuses to avoid giving disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As the various defendants’ unconvincing responses were one of the reasons that prompted this court to grant the Committal Application, it would be appropriate at this stage to look at some of the reasons/excuses that VXT (and subsequently Dinh) gave for not complying with the defendants’ discovery obligations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To avoid giving discovery of his computer hard drives, VXT claimed that he does not use a computer to run his multi-million dollar business. Instead, he claimed that he “outsources” even basic office functions such as printing and typing;

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) When he was ordered to provide details of his outsourcing arrangements, VXT claimed there were none as everything was done verbally – he had engaged a foreign student called Jason to do the typing and printing and that person had (conveniently) left Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To avoid giving discovery of his handphone, VXT claimed it was damaged and hence discarded;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) To avoid giving disclosure of his email databases, VXT claimed that he had forgotten the passwords to most of his accounts. There were two email accounts that were eventually disclosed and examined by the plaintiff’s computer experts. The experts found no “hits” when they looked for emails between VXT and DDHP. VXT claimed that the five emails or so that were disclosed represented the entirety of his exchanges with DDHP as the rest of their communication was verbal and that was the reason why there were no “hits” in his email accounts as he had deleted the emails after disclosing them to the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) To avoid giving discovery of ECPL’s and D&amp;N’s accounting ledgers, records, books, journals, receipts and invoices relating to the DDHP sales contracts, VXT claimed that he did not retain any such records and depended/relied upon bank statements as his records. The bank statements were listed in VXT’s 18th affidavit filed jointly with Dinh on 15 June 2020 (“VXT’s 18th affidavit”). However, as ECPL is registered with ACRA and at the material time was a GST-registered business, the plaintiff submitted it must comply with the tax authorities’ e-Tax Guide which requires records to be kept of all business transactions. Consequently, VXT’s excuse for not providing discovery was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) To avoid giving discovery of D&amp;N’s OCBC account that was specifically mentioned in the sales contracts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, OCBC Account No. ending 7301, VXT claimed that he had reached agreement with DDHP to make payments into the account of ECPL. When the plaintiff finally received the bank statements of D&amp;N directly from OCBC, the plaintiff discovered that in January 2016 alone, D&amp;N received six payments totalling USD1,221,757.00 from unidentified sources.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In regard to [19(f)] above, VXT subsequently changed his tune and claimed that initially, the vendor of the gasoil was D&amp;N, hence DDHP paid the deposit to D&amp;N. However, the vendor was later changed to ECPL and hence payments from DDHP were transferred from D&amp;N to ECPL’s bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Contrary to his earlier stance in [19(e)] that he had no records, VXT was later able to recall and set out in his 20th affidavit filed on 11 September 2020 (“VXT’s 20th affidavit”)

The plaintiff was prompted to obtain the Third Discovery Order before it was able to obtain directly from OCBC the account statements of the said OCBC account. The account statements of the said OCBC account revealed 156 transactions with deposits totalling around USD76m in value while withdrawals amounted to around USD54m. VXT claims that those transactions were ‘unrecorded’ while there were another 58 transactions that he ‘could not recall’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The bank statements that VXT originally disclosed were primarily loan servicing or “conduit” accounts through which large sums were deposited for 1–2 days and then withdrawn leaving a small balance on each occasion. The plaintiff applied for discovery contending that VXT and/or ECPL and D&amp;N had not disclosed bank accounts where they kept their income or savings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 VXT claimed that he, ECPL and D&amp;N have no or negligible assets. This claim did not sit well with the fact that VXT had declared that his personal/household expenses exceeded SGD25,000.00 a month.

He blamed the First <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> Order as the cause for his not being able to continue running the stall.

In holding that all five heads of contempt as set out by the plaintiffs had been proven beyond reasonable doubt, Belinda Ang J made the following helpful observations at [37]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The evidence compelled a conclusion that the contemnors had committed contempt of court by deliberately disobeying the various orders. There was no explanation or no good explanation providing a justifiable excuse for non-compliance with the various orders. The majority defendants’ single-minded objective to avoid disclosing the true value of their assets could not be condoned. That was, in my judgment, clear defiance of the authority of the court … It was necessary in the circumstances of this case, given all that had transpired, to uphold and enforce lawful orders of the court. Imprisonment, as opposed to a fine, was appropriate as there was no other effective means to ensure compliance. Each contemnor was adjudged guilty of contempt of court and was committed to imprisonment for six months … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This court had also sentenced a contemnor to a term of imprisonment of three months in <span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho (Malaysia) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Foo Tseh Wan and others</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1215 (“<span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho</span>”) for his flagrant disregard of his discovery obligations in a <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> Order that the plaintiff obtained against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 There is great similarity in the conduct of the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span>, <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> and <span class="font-italic">Toyota Tsusho</span> and in this case. At the risk of repetition, VXT and his wife Dinh intentionally refused to comply with any/all of the orders listed at [9] and [10] above. At every turn, they were bent on ensuring that the plaintiff would not be able to recover a single cent of their claim for damages. To achieve their aim, the couple were prepared to and did lie brazenly in order to avoid giving discovery of their and the assets of ECPL and D&amp;N. They acted in contumelious disregard of their discovery obligations not once or twice but on multiple occasions and maintained their lies repeatedly as can be seen in the paragraph below. To add insult to injury, their counsel invited the plaintiff

</div> to institute committal proceedings against the two defendants for such breaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 If not for the gravity of the matter and the serious implications arising therefrom, the extent of the couple’s lying would be laughable. It was naive and/or disingenuous of VXT and Dinh to expect the court to believe the following claims, all of which were mere bare assertions:-  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) VXT conducted his multi-million dollar business without any documentation whatsoever save for bank statements as he outsourced the paperwork (see [19(a)], [19(b)] and [19(e)] above);   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) VXT’s handphone was damaged and he had discarded it (see [19(c)] above);    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) VXT had forgotten the password(s) to his email account(s) and/or emails were deleted and/or there were no emails because all his communication was oral including agreement on contracts and/or variation of contracts (see [19(d)] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Payments for gasoil supplies from DDHP went into the bank account of ECPL instead of D&amp;N (see [19(f)] and [20] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) VXT and Dinh’s claim that the Mother paid for the couple’s household expenses of more than SGD25,000.00 per month. It is noteworthy that the monthly mortgage instalment alone is SGD14,000.00. Dinh had claimed parent relief for the Mother in her 2020 tax returns. When Lison’s third affidavit pointed this out, Dinh sought to explain she had made a mistake and would correct it; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Dinh’s claim that her rich relatives came to Singapore carrying bags of cash to pass to her without details of the currency involved and the frequency of such visits. It should be noted that the Vietnamese currency Dong approximates VND17,000.00 to SGD1.00 and the equivalent of SGD25,000.00 would be VN425,000,000.00;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Dinh’s claim that like VXT, she suddenly became impecunious overnight when the plaintiff applied for discovery against her pursuant to the Second <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The couple’s common assertion that their employers do not pay/have not paid their salaries but only their CPF contributions which was done via AXS machines without the issuance of receipts. Such employers would have been prosecuted by the Ministry of Manpower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff had produced evidence that proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the lies of the couple made under oath. In particular, VXT’s claims that D&amp;N did not receive payments from DDHP (see [46] above) were refuted by the bank statements of D&amp;N that the plaintiff obtained directly from OCBC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The couple was also proven to have lied in their claim that they were unable to obtain their CPF transactions statements from the CPF Board (see [43] –[45] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Presumably due to legal advice that they received that a judgment creditor cannot seize a judgment debtor’s CPF contributions, the couple thought that it would be safe to disclose their CPF contributions but not their salaries as the plaintiff could not have recourse to their CPF contributions for satisfaction of any judgment or costs orders. However, if their CPF transactions statements showed contributions, it would prove that they were lying as it meant that they had earned income and were not impecunious. Indeed, the tax returns of VXT and Dinh (as set out at [48] and [51] respectively) gave the lie to their claim to having no income. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As Mr Yap pointed out at the first hearing,

</div> the plaintiff’s request for the couple’s CPF transactions (not contributions) history was not intended to seize their CPF contributions but to verify who and to what extent the couple had used their CPF contributions to pay for the Leonie Hill property and/or to service the mortgage instalments. It was also to verify if the CPF contributions were ‘voluntary’ as the couple claimed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 VXT had a food court business which generated income which he failed to disclose. In fact, he committed a further breach by diverting a sum of SGD16,251.68 paid by the food court operator into ECPL’s bank account (frozen by the first <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> Injunction) to his own UOB account. This showed that he was a man who clearly defied court orders.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Caselaw makes it clear that the couple’s bald assertions and denials of commission would not suffice to excuse them from their breaches of the orders of court. In <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span> at [112], the Court of Appeal rejected the explanation of the contemnor as “no documentary evidence was adduced in support of his bald assertion”. In other contexts, the court has rejected bald assertions unsubstantiated by evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Holdings Pte Ltd and another</span> [2004] 4 SLR (R) 365 at [30], cited with approval in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ng Bok </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Wong Ser Wan</span> [2005] 4 SLR (R) 561 at [24]) and exaggerated claims with no documentary evidence provided in support (<span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">un Electric Pte Ltd v Menrva Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2020] 4 SLR 978 at [137]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In submissions, Mr Yap cited the cases referred to at [62] [66] and [67] above as well as <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span> <span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Sien Djim and others</span> [2014] SGHC 227, <span class="font-italic">Precious Wishes</span><span class="font-italic"> Limited v Sinoble Metalloy International (Pte) Ltd </span>[2000] SGHC 5, <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span><span class="font-italic"> Far East Pte Ltd and another v v Jaswinderpal Singh s/o Bachint Singh and others</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1391 and <span class="font-italic">Cartier </span><span class="font-italic">International BV v Lee Hock Lee and another application</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 340 to give an indication of the range of prison terms imposed by courts (three to eight months) for contempt of court. The plaintiff submitted that the appropriate punishment in this case would be a jail term of between six to eight months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It bears repeating that VXT and Dinh deliberately and continuously breached the various court orders that were the subject of the Committal Application. Obviously, they had no compunctions of lying to the extent they did throughout the affidavits that they filed in these proceedings. Their egregious conduct was hardly inadvertent as they claimed (see [45] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Notwithstanding the court’s dim view of their conduct, the court nevertheless still afforded VXT and Dinh an opportunity to make good their obligations of disclosure. Hence the court made the following orders in regard to VXT for the Committal Application:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) VXT is committed to seven months’ imprisonment for contempt of court but the committal order is suspended for seven days provided VXT complies with all his disclosure obligations under the orders of court 6803/2018, 7739/2018, 1821/2019 and 2111/2020 by 5 pm of Monday 2 November 2020;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) VXT is to pay the plaintiff the outstanding costs amounting to SGD37,485.18 by 5 pm of Friday 6 November 2020. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) VXT together with the other three defendants (on a joint and several basis) is to pay the plaintiff the costs of this application fixed at SGD16,000.00 excluding disbursements which are to be paid on a reimbursement basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As for Dinh, the court made the following order:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Fourth defendant is committed to five months’ imprisonment for contempt of court but the committal order is suspended for seven days provided the Fourth defendant complies with all her disclosure obligations under the three orders of court named (at [10] above) by 5 pm of Monday 2 November 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Based on all the authorities cited, the court was of the view that seven months’ and five months’ imprisonment were appropriate for VXT and Dinh respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Striking Out Application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In regard to the Striking Out Application, the plaintiff cited the appellate court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Agritrade International (Pte) Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 1179 (“<span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>”) for the guiding principles when such a draconian sanction should be imposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In this connection, it should be noted that D&amp;N did not file a defence at all to the plaintiff’s statement of claim. ECPL’s defence and counterclaim (Amendment No 1) filed on 12 March 2020 either denied or put the plaintiff to strict proof of its allegations. ECPL’s counterclaim was for USD423,000.00 for the demurrage it paid for detention (for which it claimed it was not contractually liable to the plaintiff). VXT’s defence (Amendment No 2) filed on 12 March 2020 either (i) did not plead to the plaintiff’s allegations, (ii) denied the allegations and/or (iii) put the plaintiff to strict proof. As for the Fourth defendant’s defence filed on 23 June 2020, she essentially denied the plaintiff’s allegations.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The court is mindful that the Striking Out Application did not involve the defendants’ non-compliance with an “unless order” which non-compliance would have been an even more serious breach on the part of VXT and Dinh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Striking Out Application (see [7] above) had included an alternative prayer that there be an order that, unless the defendants do, within seven days of the date of the order of court to be made herein, comply in full with the orders of court set out in [9] and [10], the defendants’ pleadings should be struck out and (i) interlocutory judgment be entered for the plaintiff without further order against ECPL and VXT with costs of the action and for damages to be assessed; (ii) final judgment be entered for the plaintiff against Dinh with costs of the action and (iii) interlocutory judgment be entered in default of defence against D&amp;N with costs of the action and for damages to be assessed pursuant to O 19 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The appellate court had in <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span> at [35]–[41] set out the criteria when a court would exercise its power to strike out pleadings for breach of an “unless order”. The guiding principle was that of proportionality. The onus was on the defaulting party to demonstrate that the breach had not been intentional and contumelious. As observed in [65] earlier, neither VXT nor Dinh could avail themselves of the defence set out in s 21 of the AJPA nor the extenuating factor the Court of Appeal raised in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Even so, the court did not grant the Striking Out Application immediately – instead, it made an “unless order” as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If VXT and Dinh fail to comply with the orders made in the Committal Application by 5 pm of Monday 2 November 2020, the Striking Out Application would be granted without further order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Instead of complying with the directions made under the Committal and Striking Out Applications, VXT and Dinh as well as the other two corporate defendants chose to appeal.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Yin Soon and Dorcas Seah Yi Hui (Allen &amp;
