        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arose from the following undisputed
                    facts. A water inlet hose (“the Water Inlet Hose”) which carried
                    water to a water dispensing unit (“WDU”) located at the office of
                    the second respondent, Liquid Advertising Pte Ltd (“Liquid
                    Advertising”) ruptured. This resulted in water seepage into an art
                    gallery situated directly below. The art gallery was owned and operated by the
                    first respondent, Ho See Jui trading as Xuanhua Art Gallery (“Ho See
                    Jui”). The water seepage extensively damaged the paintings displayed and
                    stored in Ho See Jui’s Xuanhua Art Gallery (“the Art
                    Gallery”). The WDU was supplied, installed and maintained by the
                    appellant, Goh Sin Huat Electrical Pte Ltd. Ho See Jui commenced these
                    proceedings against Liquid Advertising and the appellant in order to recover
                    monies for the loss and damage sustained as a result of the water leakage from
                    the rupture of the Water Inlet Hose. Both the trial and this appeal solely
                    concerned the question of liability. Accordingly, evidence as to the quantum of
                    damages suffered by Ho See Jui was not adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The High Court Judge (“the Judge”)
                    in <em>Ho See Jui (trading as Xuanhua Art Gallery) v Liquid
                        Advertising Pte Ltd and another</em> [2011] SGHC 108 gave
                    judgment in favour of Ho See Jui with costs to be borne by Liquid Advertising
                    and the appellant. The Judge ordered that liability between Liquid Advertising
                    and the appellant be apportioned in the following proportions: 30% to be borne
                    by Liquid Advertising and 70% to be borne by the appellant. Further, as between
                    Liquid Advertising and the appellant, it was ordered that the appellant
                    indemnify Liquid Advertising in respect of their 30% liability to Ho See Jui. In
                    effect, the appellant was held to bear 100% of the liability for Ho See
                    Jui’s losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After considering the parties’
                    submissions, this appeal was partially allowed only with respect to the order of
                    indemnity granted by the Judge. Thus, the apportionment of liability reverted to
                    70% to the appellant and 30% to Liquid Advertising. The costs order was also
                    varied to reflect the percentage of liability borne by both parties. We now give
                    the full reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Personae Dramatis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Ho See Jui, the plaintiff and the first
                    respondent in this appeal, is in the business of exhibiting and selling
                    contemporary Chinese ink paintings which are traditionally painted on rice
                    paper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Liquid Advertising, the first defendant and
                    second respondent in this appeal was at all material times the tenant of
                    70A Bussorah Street (“the Second Floor Unit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant, the second defendant, was at all
                    material times the sole local distributor of the “Frigeria” brand
                    of WDUs, one of which was installed in the Second Floor Unit. The appellant was
                    also responsible for repairing and maintaining the said WDU.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Ho See Jui was the tenant of the ground floor of
                    a two-storey shophouse located at 70 Bussorah Street, Singapore 199483. Ho
                    See Jui owned and operated the Art Gallery in the leased space where he
                    displayed his traditional rice paper paintings. The Second Floor Unit which was
                    leased by Liquid Advertising was located directly above the Art Gallery. On or
                    about 2 April 2001, the appellant sold Liquid Advertising a
                    “Frigeria” brand of WDU which was initially installed in Liquid
                    Advertising’s previous office, located at 770A North Bridge Road,
                    Singapore 198738.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 2 September 2004, acting on Liquid
                    Advertising’s request the appellant re-installed the WDU in the Second
                    Floor Unit. In the course of the reinstallation of the WDU, the appellant also
                    supplied a water inlet hose connecting the water mains in the Second Floor Unit
                    to the WDU. For ease of reference, the area where the WDU was installed will
                    henceforth be referred to as the “WDU Area”. It was common ground
                    that the Water Inlet Hose carrying water to the WDU ruptured sometime between
                    the evening of 24 September 2008 and the early morning of 25 September
                    2008. The water that leaked from the ruptured Water Inlet Hose seeped through
                    the flooring of the Second Floor Unit into the Art Gallery. Ho See Jui alleged
                    that the water that seeped into the Art Gallery damaged his paintings and the
                    cabinet storing his paintings – this damage formed the basis of his action
                    against Liquid Advertising and the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The reinstallation agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 28 August 2004, shortly before
                    relocating to the Second Floor Unit, Liquid Advertising entered into an
                    agreement with the appellant for the latter to re-install the WDU at the new
                    premises (“the Reinstallation Agreement”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. A quotation issued for the

<p class="Judg-1">We should add that it was not disputed that the WDU Area had timber
                    flooring which could allow water to pass through its cracks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The maintenance agreements of the WDU</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Liquid Advertising also entered into service
                    and maintenance contracts with the appellant in August 2001 (“the First
                    Maintenance Contract”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, on 11 December

                    “the Maintenance Contracts”). Pursuant to the First Maintenance
                    Contract, the appellant maintained and serviced the WDU on four separate
                    occasions between September 2001 and November 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Third Maintenance Contract, valid from
                    22 June 2005 to 21 June 2007, stated that the WDU was to be serviced a
                    total of eight times. In all, the WDU was serviced on 16 occasions. The last
                    service was conducted on 16 September 2008, eight to nine days before the
                    rupture of the Water Inlet Hose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Though not in the First Maintenance Contract,
                    the Second and Third Maintenance Contracts contained the following clause
                    (“the Disclaimer”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DEAR CUSTOMER,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THE INSTALLATION OF THE WATER COOLER AND/OR WATER

<p class="Judg-1">The Disclaimer was also inserted in the appellant’s service
                    orders which were issued for services carried out under the Maintenance
                    Contracts, and in the service order issued for the reinstallation of the WDU at
                    the Second Floor Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of Pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Ho See Jui raised three causes of action
                    against Liquid Advertising in his claim for general and special damages. He
                    successfully maintained claims in the tort of negligence, in the tort of private
                    nuisance and under the rule in <em>John Rylands and Jehu
                        </em><em>Horrocks v Thomas Fletcher</em> (1868)
                    LR 3 HL 330 (“<em>Rylands v Fletcher</em>”).
                    Ho See Jui also pleaded two causes of action against the appellant; one in the
                    tort of negligence and another in the tort of private nuisance. Specifically, Ho
                    See Jui alleged that the appellant was negligent in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     installing the Water Inlet Hose
                        which was inherently unsuitable for the carriage of potable water and/or for
                        use with the WDU; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     providing and/or installing the Water Inlet Hose without ascertaining
                        whether the Water Inlet Hose was suitable for use with the
                    WDU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The appellant denied that it owed a duty of care to Ho
                    See Jui or that it breached that duty for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     the appellant did not know that
                        the carpeted flooring at the WDU Area was made of timber and that the WDU
                        Area was located directly above Ho See Jui’s cabinet containing some
                        of his paintings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     the appellant was not responsible for the location where the WDU was
                        installed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        appellant did not install the Water Inlet Hose; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     the appellant additionally claimed
                        that the Water Inlet Hose appeared to have been deliberately
                    cut.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, as with his claim against Liquid Advertising,
                    Ho See Jui alleged that the appellant had created a nuisance by installing the
                    WDU at an inappropriate location.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Notice of contribution or indemnity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 8 December 2010, Liquid Advertising
                    served a notice claiming contribution or indemnity against the appellant for any
                    losses attributable to it from Ho See Jui’s claim. Liquid Advertising
                    claimed that it was entitled to an indemnity or contribution because the
                    appellant had breached various implied terms of the Reinstallation Agreement and
                    the Maintenance Contracts in two aspects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, Liquid Advertising took the
                        position that the Water Inlet Hose was of an unsatisfactory quality and/or
                        was not reasonably fit for its intended purpose; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, Liquid Advertising claimed
                        that the appellant did not perform its obligations under the Reinstallation
                        Agreement and the Maintenance Contracts with reasonable care and skill, or
                        at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The main arguments raised by the appellant in
                    response to Liquid Advertising’s claim for an indemnity or contribution
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, the Maintenance Contracts
                        expired before 24 September 2008 or the date of rupture of the Water
                        Inlet Hose;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, under the terms of the Third Maintenance Agreement, the appellant
                        did not take responsibility for the location of the WDU. Further, the
                        appellant’s duties only concerned the WDU itself and not the Water
                        Inlet Hose;</p>

                        Reinstallation Agreement and the Third Maintenance Agreement were not so
                        implied because the Water Inlet Hose was not installed by the appellant;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     fourth, and
                        in the alternative, the appellant was entitled to rely on the Quotation
                        Warning and the Disclaimer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cause of the rupture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge held that the Water Inlet Hose
                    ruptured due to (a) hydrolysis and (b) a pre-existing fabrication
                    defect in the form of two helical seam lines (“the Helical Line
                    Feature”). The Judge found that the Helical Line Feature would not have
                    had any impact on the use of the Water Inlet Hose if it had been used for its
                    intended purpose of carrying compressed air.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Judge also accepted expert
                    opinions that the Water Inlet Hose was not suitable for use with the WDU on the
                    basis of an industry standard for the types of hoses approved for the carriage
                    of water.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
                    three causes identified for the rupture were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, the hydrolytic degradation of
                        the Water Inlet Hose;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, the Helical Line Feature; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     third, the location of the WDU at the WDU Area
                        because the flooring of the WDU Area was water
                permeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Rejecting the appellant’s argument that
                    the Water Inlet Hose was not installed by them, the Judge found that on the
                    balance of probabilities the evidence suggested that the Water Inlet Hose must
                    have been the water inlet hose that was installed by the appellant on
                    2 September 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability and apportionment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As noted above, the Judge found that Liquid
                    Advertising was liable to Ho See Jui for all three causes of action in the tort
                    of negligence, private nuisance and the rule under <em>Rylands v
                        Fletcher</em>. The <em>sole reason</em>
                    identified by the Judge as underscoring Liquid Advertising’s liability was
                    the fact that they instructed the appellant to install the WDU at the WDU Area
                        (<em>ie</em>, the third cause stated above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) despite the Quotation Warning (above at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>), the Disclaimer and warnings in the
                    service orders (above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). Liquid
                    Advertising did not appeal against any of the Judge’s
                findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the other hand, the appellant was only
                    found to be liable to Ho See Jui for having committed the tort of private
                    nuisance. The Judge reasoned that the appellant was responsible for installing
                    the Water Inlet Hose which was unsuitable for the carriage of water and for
                    ignoring its own warnings that the WDU should have been installed at the wet
                    pantry area. Unlike Liquid Advertising, the appellant was held to be responsible
                    for <em>all three causes</em> which were identified by the
                    Judge (above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). As for Ho See
                    Jui’s claim against the appellant in negligence, the Judge held that she
                    was not satisfied that the appellant owed Ho See Jui a duty of care.
                    Accordingly, no finding was made in relation to this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Having found Liquid Advertising to be liable
                    under all three causes of action and the appellant in the tort of private
                    nuisance, the Judge found that Ho See Jui was entitled to a joint judgment as
                    the acts of either defendant could not be attributed to distinct portions of the
                    damage suffered by Ho See Jui. As noted above, the damage was identified to have
                    been caused by a combination of three causes, <em>viz</em>,
                    the Helical Line Feature, hydrolytic degradation of the Water Inlet Hose and the
                    location of the WDU at the WDU Area. By reason of Liquid Advertising’s
                    limited responsibility only in relation to the location of the WDU, the Judge
                    found that a just and equitable apportionment was 30% liability to Liquid
                    Advertising and 70% liability to the appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Indemnity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Judge also found that Liquid Advertising
                    was entitled to an indemnity from the appellant by reason of breaches of implied
                    conditions under the Reinstallation Agreement, implied under s 4(2) of the
                    Supply of Goods Act (Cap 394, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the SGA”).
                    First, s 4(2) of the SGA implied that the goods supplied under the contract
                    were of “<em>satisfactory quality</em>”.
                    Second, s 4(2A) of the SGA provided for an objective test for determining
                    whether the goods were of satisfactory quality:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2A)  For the purposes of this section and
                            section 5, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the
                            standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking
                            account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all
                            the other relevant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge held that the Water Inlet Hose that the appellant had
                    supplied was unsatisfactory because a reasonable person would consider that a
                    hose meant to carry water should not be made of a material prone to hydrolytic
                    degradation. The implied condition that goods supplied by the appellant are to
                    be of satisfactory quality was breached for the same reason. Accordingly, the
                    appellant was ordered to indemnify Liquid Advertising’s proportion of
                    liability owed to Ho See Jui.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The appellant took issue with the
                    Judge’s (a) findings of fact, (b) the apportionment of liability
                    and (c) the order to indemnify Liquid Advertising.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings of fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The following grounds of appeal were raised
                    against the two primary findings of fact identified as relevant to the
                    appellant’s liability under the tort of private nuisance:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Whether it was
                            the appellant who had installed the Water Inlet
                            Hose</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> specifically, the appellant argued that the
                        Judge failed to give due weight to the evidence of all three expert
                        witnesses which strongly suggested that the Water Inlet Hose could not have
                        been the same water inlet hose that had been installed by the Appellant four
                        years earlier in 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Whether the appellant was responsible
                            for the location of the WDU at the WDU Area</em>: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> the appellant
                        argued that the Judge failed to give due weight to the appellant’s
                        provision of numerous warnings to Liquid Advertising which clearly stated
                        that the WDU should have been installed at a wet pantry area and that the
                        appellant would not be responsible for any leakage. In essence, the
                        appellant argued that the Judge should have placed greater weight on Liquid
                        Advertising’s unilateral and independent decision to install the WDU
                        at the WDU Area.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apportionment of liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the alternative, on the issue of
                    apportionment of liability between Liquid Advertising and the appellant, the
                    following grounds of appeal were raised:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Judge failed to give due
                        weight to the fact that Liquid Advertising had been provided with numerous
                        warnings by the appellant that the WDU should have been installed at a wet
                        pantry area; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the learned Judge completely failed to consider the unchallenged
                        evidence before the Court that locating the WDU at the wet pantry area would
                        have prevented most, if not all, of the water that had leaked from the Water
                        Inlet Hose from flowing to the Art Gallery; as most of the leaked water
                        would have been drained away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The order to indemnify Liquid Advertising</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, on the issue of indemnity, the
                    appellant made the following submissions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Judge completely failed to give
                        consideration to her other holding that Liquid Advertising itself had been
                        negligent in instructing that the WDU be located at the WDU Area and not the
                        wet pantry area; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Judge fell into error by failing to take Liquid
                        Advertising’s contributory negligence into account when deciding on
                        the extent, if any, to which the appellant was obliged to indemnify Liquid
                        Advertising.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Broadly speaking, the appellant raised three
                    grounds of appeal which will be addressed in the following order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the findings of fact made by
                        the Judge in support of the appellant’s liability in the tort of
                        private nuisance were supported by the weight of the evidence before the
                        Court (below at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Judge erred in the apportionment of liability
                        (below at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>–<a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the Judge erred in ordering the
                        appellant to completely indemnify Liquid Advertising (below at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>–<a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether the findings of fact made by the Judge in support of
                the appellant’s liability in the tort of private nuisance were supported by
                the weight of the evidence before the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">First finding: Whether the Water Inlet Hose had been installed by the
                appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The appellant placed great weight on certain
                    excerpts from the expert evidence before the Judge relating to the condition of
                    the Water Inlet Hose. The Water Inlet Hose was described as follows: <em>“it was very new</em>”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and that it <em>“would appear likely that the pipe was very recently
                        installed</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> By reason of the alleged
                    “pristine state” of the hose, the appellant argued that the Water
                    Inlet Hose could not have been the same hose that was installed by the appellant
                    four years prior to the incident. Secondly, the appellant postulated that based
                    on the expert evidence before the Court, the hydrolytic degradation would have
                    caused any water inlet hose similar to the Water Inlet Hose to have ruptured
                    within weeks or months of being exposed to water. Thus it was clear that the
                    Water Inlet Hose could not have been the same water inlet hose that had been
                    installed by the appellant in September 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> In
                    summary, the appellant sought to establish that the Water Inlet Hose was not
                    installed by them because (a) it looked too new to be four years old, and
                    (b) because if it indeed was installed in 2004, by reason of the process of
                    hydrolytic degradation, it would have ruptured within weeks or months of
                    exposure to water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Our appraisal of the expert opinion relied on
                    by the appellant revealed that the high threshold for appellate review of a
                    finding of fact was not met as the expert evidence did not clearly indicate
                    either (a) or (b) (above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). Even if
                    it were accepted that there were gaps in the evidence, and the appellant was
                    right that the Water Inlet Hose was replaced after 2004, on a balance of
                    probabilities, this replacement was likely to have been performed by the
                    appellant. Why would Liquid Advertising have chosen to replace the water inlet
                    hose itself or engaged some other party to do so when it had an existing
                    maintenance arrangement with the appellant (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below)? With
                    that general preface we turn to examining this argument more
                closely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The Water Inlet Hose looked “new”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The preliminary examination report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Liquid Advertising’s witness,
                    Mr Graham Alan Cooper (“Mr Cooper”) had prior experience
                    as a materials scientist specialising in failure analysis and failure
                    investigation for more than 25 years. The appellant heavily relied on the
                    reproduced portion of Mr Cooper’s report (“the preliminary
                    report”) which was based on a preliminary, non-destructive inspection of
                    the Water Inlet Hose on or about 20 October 2008 (less than a month after
                    its rupture on 25 September 2008). It was carried out on the instructions
                    of Liquid Advertising’s loss adjusters, Cunningham Lindsay (Singapore) Pte
                    Ltd. Mr Cooper observed as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The pipe is in <em>pristine condition</em> with only
                        minimal wear and abrasion present on the outer surfaces. The general
                        condition of the pipe suggests that <em>it is nearly
                            new</em>, which is consistent with it having been <em>fitted to the water cooler very recently</em>. <em>The condition is not consistent with the reported age of the
                            water cooler, i.e. 4 years</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The weight to be given to
                    Mr Cooper’s opinion must be determined keeping in mind that this
                    report was preliminary. Further, Mr Cooper only carried out a
                    non-destructive inspection of the Water Inlet Hose and the inspection was only a
                    visual one which did not involve any detailed analysis of the same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Liquid Advertising argued that the purpose of
                    Mr Cooper’s report was for him to assess whether the damage had been
                    caused externally or whether there was a defect with the Water Inlet Hose. After
                    having examined the Water Inlet Hose in greater detail, Mr Cooper found
                    that there were no markings on it which identified the date of its
                        manufacture.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In his subsequent expert report,
                    Mr Cooper clarified his views in relation to the appearance of the Water
                    Inlet Hose. In Mr Cooper’s expert report dated 4 October 2010,
                    he reiterated that when he had conducted the examination of the Water Inlet Hose
                    in October 2008, the Water Inlet Hose was in very good condition:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Water Inlet Hose] was found to be in visually very good condition
                        ..., with only minimal wear and abrasion present on the outer
                        surface.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, Mr Cooper also stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Markings on the hose identified its manufacturer, size and type. However,
                        there were no markings present that identified its date of manufacture. It
                        is therefore not possible to conclusively establish the age of the hose. The
                        exterior of the hose was in almost pristine condition, which suggested that
                        it may have been relatively new at the time of the incident, as stated at
                        page 2 of [the preliminary report]. <em>However, I should
                            clarify that if it had been installed in a relatively clean environment
                            and had been protected from general wear and tear, it is possible that
                            it could have been the original hose that was fitted when the subject
                            WDU was installed at [Liquid Advertising’s] Premises in
                            2004</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Water Inlet Hose was installed in an
                    enclosed office area, outside of the wet pantry area which was used for spraying
                    adhesives in the course of Liquid Advertising’s business. It was not
                    exposed to sunlight or adhesives. The appearance alone of the hose, documented
                    in a preliminary report did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that
                    it was new. Mr Cooper’s evidence was interpreted by the Judge in
                    support of her findings; it was reasonably plausible that in the conditions in
                    which the Water Inlet Hose was stored, it remained looking new despite its age
                    and installation in 2004. Thus the appellant’s submission was not borne
                    out by Mr Cooper’s preliminary view alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Mr Liam Kok Chye’s expert report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Ho See Jui’s witness at the trial below,
                    Liam Kok Chye (“Mr Liam”) had relevant experience in failure
                    and material analysis of polymers and plastics. The appellant relied on
                    para 5.2(d) of Mr Liam’s expert report, wherein he stated as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on a review of the reported background information regarding the
                        WDU, it appears that the WDU was in use for about 8 years. The [Water Inlet
                        Hose] was also reportedly <b><u>replaced</u></b> around 4
                        years prior to the incident. Considering that the [Water Inlet Hose] instead
                        of commonly accepted tube material such as polyethylene was used, <em>it is likely that this [Water Inlet Hose] was changed from the
                            originally installed [water inlet hose]</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On a plain reading, this excerpt from Mr Liam’s evidence
                    did not lend any support to the appellant’s argument. In our view,
                    Mr Liam was merely confirming the likelihood that the Water Inlet Hose was
                    the hose which was “reportedly replaced” in 2004 as it could not
                    have been the same tube as was installed when the WDU was installed eight years
                    earlier. In other words, when the WDU was re-installed in the Second Floor Unit,
                    the Water Inlet Hose was replaced. Accordingly, on the first issue of the
                    “new appearance” of the Water Inlet Hose, one possible explanation
                    as suggested by Mr Cooper was the clean environment that it was stored in.
                    At the end of the day, it appeared plain to us that the evidence relied upon by
                    the appellant did not establish that the finding of fact made by the Judge
                        (<em>ie</em>, that the Water Inlet Hose was installed
                    by the appellant in 2004) was plainly wrong or unjustified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The likely period of time before the Water Inlet Hose should have
                ruptured</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, the appellant also relied on the
                    argument that the Water Inlet Hose could not have been the same one which was
                    installed in 2004 as, by reason of the speed of hydrolytic degradation, it would
                    not have remained intact for four years. The appellant relied on
                    Mr Liam’s evidence in support of this proposition. In his expert
                    report, Mr Liam noted that the Water Inlet Hose, being made of polyester,
                    was susceptible to degradation on prolonged contact with water and was thus
                    inappropriate for use in potable water systems like the WDU.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Mr Liam also clarified that the
                    degradation of the Water Inlet Hose due to exposure to water would have taken
                    place within <em>a few weeks or months</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the one hand, the appellant argued that it
                    was significant that when directly queried by the Judge if the degradation of
                    the Water Inlet Hose would have taken place over a period of years,
                    Mr Liam’s response was that the degradation would have occurred
                    within <em>weeks or months</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Liquid Advertising,
                    on the other hand, interpreted Mr Liam’s evidence as indicating that
                    his comments in relation to the time frame of “months or weeks”
                    related to the time before degradation set in and the chemical attack took place
                    rather than how long it would have taken from the time the Water Inlet Hose came
                    into contact with water to the time it ruptured.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    Unfortunately, the precise time likely to have been taken from the installation
                    of the Water Inlet Hose to its rupture was not extensively investigated in any
                    of the expert reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In light of the unsatisfactory nature of the
                    evidence, leaving aside the question of degradation for a moment, on the
                    evidence before this Court, <em>even if</em> the water
                    inlet hose installed in 2004 had indeed been replaced, we were of the view that
                    on the balance of probabilities it was replaced by the appellant (below at
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>). Thus the arguments raised by the appellant seeking to
                    establish that the Water Inlet Hose was not installed by them were effectively
                    neutralised. The objective evidence supported the finding that any subsequent
                    replacement of the water inlet hose was, on a balance of probabilities,
                    performed by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Replacement Water Inlet Hose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It was not disputed that a water inlet hose
                    had been installed by the appellant in September 2004. The issue really was
                    whether an independent third party or perhaps even Liquid Advertising had
                    installed a replacement in the four years between 2004 and the date of rupture.
                    We found the likelihood of Liquid Advertising choosing to replace the water
                    inlet hose on its own accord to be highly unlikely. The replacement of the water
                    inlet hose would have involved the following steps which were both time
                    consuming and required expertise on the part of the individual servicing the
                        equipment:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>

                        the WDU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, Liquid Advertising was likely to have
                    lacked the necessary expertise to replace the water inlet hose, explaining their
                    decision to enter into three separate agreements with the appellants to service
                    and maintain the WDU unit in the first place. In fact, as noted above (at
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>), the appellant continued to
                    service the WDU regularly until 16 September 2008, eight to nine days

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Furthermore, we were inclined to agree that if
                    a third party had provided another water inlet hose, Liquid Advertising’s
                    employees would have had either the knowledge or a record of this. Liquid
                    Advertising employees/ex-employees testified that the water inlet hose was
                    installed by the appellant and/or that the appellant was the only party who had
                    provided maintenance services for the WDU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     While the appellant argued that the Water
                    Inlet Hose could have been subsequently replaced by someone else and that other
                    employees of Liquid Advertising who did not testify may have known of this,
                    these arguments were speculative. It was always open to the appellant to call
                    any witness and discover any documents that it thought would advance its case
                    theory. Pertinently, the evidence given by Liquid Advertising’s employees
                    who were called as witnesses was not challenged by the appellants. Further, it
                    seemed curious that the appellant would have continued to regularly service the
                    WDU unit without realising that a replacement had been made by a third
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Accordingly, if indeed there had been any
                    replacement of the water inlet hose between 2004 and the date of rupture, on a
                    balance of probabilities, on the evidence, we were satisfied that this
                    replacement was performed by the appellant. Accordingly, there was no reason to
                    disturb the Judge’s finding that the Water Inlet Hose was installed by the
                    appellant.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The appellant further submitted that the Judge
                    erred in finding that the appellant was responsible for the location of the WDU
                    for the following reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     pursuant to a contractual
                        arrangement between the appellant and Liquid Advertising it was Liquid
                        Advertising and not the appellant who would be responsible for the location
                        of the WDU; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was Liquid Advertising’s unilateral decision that the WDU was to
                        be installed at the WDU area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the appellant
                    took the position that it had been wrongly held responsible for the third cause
                    of the location of the WDU in the WDU Area. As noted above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>, as the appellant was found to have installed
                    the Water Inlet Hose, the Judge’s findings of liability founded by the two
                    other causes, <em>viz</em>, the Helical Line Feature and
                    hydrolytic degradation remained undisturbed. On the available evidence, we found
                    that the Judge was correct to have found the appellant responsible for the
                    location of the WDU at the WDU Area instead of the wet pantry area for the
                    reasons stated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The appellant relied on the Disclaimer and
                    Quotation Warning in the quotation and service contracts (above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>–<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>)
                    which notified Liquid Advertising of the dangers of installing a WDU outside the
                    wet pantry area. It was argued that the decision to install the WDU in the WDU
                    Area rather than the wet pantry area was made by Liquid Advertising without
                    reference to the appellant. The appellant suggested that Liquid Advertising
                    wished to use the wet pantry area to carry out the spraying of adhesives on art
                    work, which was part of its advertising business. Also, the appellant heavily
                    relied on the fact that in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”), Mr Goh explained that the above warnings had been
                    introduced into the appellant’s contracts and service orders as the
                    appellant had no way of controlling where the owner of a WDU may decide to
                    install the WDU or the suitability of the placement site of the WDU. He stated
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">h.    The [WDU] is small and light. And, [Liquid
                                Advertising] could re-position the said [WDU] wherever they
                                chose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    In short [the appellant] incorporated the warning
                            that the [WDU] should be installed in a wet pantry area because it has
                            no way of controlling where the owner may decide to install the said
                            [WDU] or knowing how suitable that placement site may be. <em>[The appellant] would install a [WDU] in a library or
                                </em><em>a meeting room if that is what a buyer
                                of a Frigeria </em><em>[WDU] wants and will pay
                                for</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It was not disputed that Liquid Advertising
                    had instructed the appellant to install the WDU at the WDU Area. It was also not
                    disputed that the decision on where to place the WDU had been made independently
                    by Liquid Advertising, before it instructed the appellant to relocate the
                        WDU.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> In fact, before
                    the Judge, Mr Adrian Ng of Liquid Advertising explained that the decision
                    to locate the WDU at the WDU Area and not the wet pantry area was a conscious
                    decision made by Liquid Advertising.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> It was because of Liquid
                    Advertising’s above-mentioned conduct that the Judge found them to have
                    been responsible for one cause of the damage, namely the third cause, <em>ie</em>, the location of the WDU at the WDU Area. As a
                    consequence of this, the Judge did not find the appellant to be solely
                    responsible for the location of the WDU. Thus the more relevant question to be
                    asked was whether the fact that Liquid Advertising had decided the location of
                    the WDU <em>absolved</em> the appellant of <em>any responsibility</em> in relation to the same. The answer
                    to this question was in the negative for the reasons given below at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Independent of the responsibility borne by
                    Liquid Advertising for its instructions, the appellant also did in fact have a
                    role in the location of the installation of the WDU. The appellant’s
                    conduct in fact illustrated its awareness of its responsibility. Prior to the
                    relocation and reinstallation of the WDU at the Second Floor Unit, on
                    23 August 2004, the appellant sent experienced workers to assess if the
                    area where Liquid Advertising wanted to have the WDU installed was
                        appropriate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> In addition to a planned site visit, the
                    appellant’s staff was also trained to verbally inform customers that the
                    WDU should be installed in a wet pantry area.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The appellant had given
                    internal directions to its staff to comply with the Quotation
                        Warning:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>

                            be damage”? Is that what you are saying?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">If indeed the appellants had taken a hands-off approach on this
                    issue, as they alleged, it was odd that they undertook a site visit (in addition
                    to training and service functions) in relation to the location of installation
                    of the WDU. Furthermore, contrary to Mr Goh’s AEIC (above at
                        <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>) under cross examination,
                    Mr Goh accepted that the appellant could also refuse to install the WDU in
                    an unsuitable area.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>
                    This admission alone was sufficient to expose the fact that the appellant viewed
                    itself as, at the very least, partially responsible for the location of the
                    installation of the WDU. Mr Goh stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Our practice is if they know it’s not a wet

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, not only did the appellant have a <em>right</em> to refuse to install the WDU outside the wet pantry area
                    but the appellant also took the view that faced with such a request, they would
                    simply “<em>not do it</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Given these facts it was only reasonable that
                    the appellant bore some responsibility to Liquid Advertising as the installer
                    and servicer of the “Frigeria” brand of WDU. The appellant would
                    have known far better than a commercial client what constituted a
                    “suitable area” for the installation of the WDU. On this basis
                    alone, the appellant owed a duty to its customer to take reasonable care and
                    skill in the installation of the WDUs. Also, Ho See Jui’s expert witness
                    Mr Wan Fook Yong stated that when installing the WDU in a non-wet pantry
                    area, the appellant should have installed a tray beneath the WDU with a
                    connecting discharge pipe leading to the water trap in the wet pantry area to
                    prevent or mitigate the damage caused by any possible leakage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Despite
                    having knowledge of the significance of such a discharge pipe and its
                    significance when a WDU is installed in a non-wet pantry area, the appellant
                    failed to install such a pipe.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Judge, in our view, correctly found that
                    the appellant was at least equally responsible for ignoring its own Quotation
                    Warning when installing the WDU at the WDU Area. Further, from the evidence
                    discussed above, it was clear that the appellant saw itself as responsible to
                    some degree for the location of installation of the WDU and could have refused
                    to install the WDU at an unsuitable area even if so instructed by a client. This
                    evidence shone an unflattering light on the contractual agreement with Liquid
                    Advertising as described by the appellant. Furthermore, in installing the WDU in
                    a non-wet pantry area, the appellant should have installed a discharge tube so
                    as to mitigate any water leakage. Accordingly, the Judge’s finding that
                    both the appellant and Liquid Advertising were responsible for the location of
                    the WDU was clearly supported by the weight of the evidence. Thus, the
                    appellant’s challenge to the Judge’s finding on its liability was
                    without merit. The question then turned to whether the Judge erred in the
                    apportionment of liability between Liquid Advertising and the appellant as joint
                    tortfeasors.</p>

                        Macgregor</em>. It appears to us that this observation requires
                    further clarification. To start with, it is worthwhile setting out the full
                    context within which the <em>The Macgregor</em> quote cited
                        <em>in part</em> above (cited with approval in
                        <em>TV Media</em>), should be understood. In <em>The Macgregor</em>, Lord Chancellor Viscount Simon had
                    stated at 198–199:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only question that remains for debate is the question of the
                        distribution of that blame. Speaking for myself, I think that the conclusion
                        at which Bucknill J. arrived on that question was a perfectly
                        reasonable one, having regard to the facts which he found. The Court of
                        Appeal, however, has thought it right while maintaining the view that both
                        ships were to blame, to vary the distribution of the blame by putting
                        two-thirds of it on the <em>British Fame</em> and
                        relieving the <em>Macgregor</em> so that the <em>Macgregor</em> has to carry only the remaining
                        one-third.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me, my Lords, that the cases must be very exceptional indeed
                        in which an appellate court, while accepting the findings of fact of the
                        court below as to the fixing of blame, none the less has sufficient reason
                        to alter the allocation of the blame made by the trial judge. I do not say
                        that there may not be such cases. I apprehend that, if a number of different
                        reasons were given why one ship is to blame, but the Court of Appeal, on
                        examination, found some of those reasons not to be valid, that might have
                        the effect of altering the distribution of the burden. If the trial judge,
                        when distributing blame, could be shown to have misapprehended a vital fact
                        bearing on the matter, that, I think, would be a reason for considering
                        whether a change in the distribution should be made on appeal. But, subject
                        to rare exceptions, I submit to the House that, when findings of fact are
                        not disputed and the conclusion that both vessels are to blame stands, the
                        cases in which an appellate tribunal will undertake to revise the
                        distribution of blame will be rare.</p>
<p>Concurring with the Lord Chancellor’s view,
                    Lord Wright explained the difference between an appeal brought exclusively
                    on findings of fact and one on apportionment of liability, albeit in the context
                    of admiralty law (at 200). Citing the earlier House of Lords decisions of
                        <em>The Umtali</em> (1938) 160 L T 114, 117 and
                        <em>Owners of S.S. Haugland v Owners of S.S.
                        Karamea</em> [1922] AC 68, he stated that it would take a “very
                    strong case” to induce a court to interfere with the judge’s
                        <em>discretion</em> as to the proportions of blame.
                    Further, so long as the appellate court arrived at the same conclusion on both
                    the facts and in law, it should not then interfere with the apportionment order
                    merely because it disagrees with the proportions given by the trial judge.
                    Explaining his view further he remarked, in apportionment appeals (at
                    201):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a question of the degree of fault, depending on a trained and expert
                        judgment considering all the circumstances, and it is different in essence
                        from a mere finding of fact in the ordinary sense. It is a question, not of
                        principle or of positive findings of fact or law, but of proportion, of
                        balance and relative emphasis, and of weighing different considerations. It
                        involves an individual choice or discretion, as to which there may well be
                        differences of opinion by different minds. It is for that reason, I think,
                        that an appellate court has been warned against interfering save in very
                        exceptional circumstances, with the judge’s apportionment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It is, however, clear that
                    ‘exceptional’ circumstances as conceived by the House of Lords,
                    includes the trial judge’s error in law and failure to apply his or her
                    mind to a material fact bearing on the relative culpability of the parties found
                    to be jointly liable. By way of comparison, in appeals against ordinary findings
                    of fact, this Court in <em>Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng
                        Leong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 939 at [21] had earlier adopted
                    the approach of the House of Lords in its seminal decision in <em>Mrs Sarah Ann </em><em>Clarke v Edinburgh and
                        District Tramways Company, Limited</em> (1919) SC HL 35 wherein
                    Lord Shaw of Dunfermline said (at 36):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a Judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference
                        with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that
                        judgment is entitled to great respect, and that quite irrespective of
                        whether the Judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not. I
                        can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not
                        interfere in a case in which the Judge has announced as part of his judgment
                        that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and
                        does not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a
                        Court of justice. In Courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much
                        more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a
                        conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their
                        hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the
                        eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can
                        never be reproduced in the printed page. What in such circumstances, thus
                        psychologically put, is the duty of the appellate Court? In my opinion, the
                        duty of an appellate Court in these circumstances is for each Judge of it to
                        put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I — who sit
                        here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which
                        are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case – in a
                        position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that
                        the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? <em>If I cannot be
                            satisfied in my own mind that the judge with those privileges was
                            </em><b><em>plainly wrong</em></b><em>, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his
                            judgment</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The basis for review of findings of fact in the Singapore context has
                    been restated in <em>Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix
                        Leasing Singapore Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101
                        (“<em>Tat Seng</em>”) at [41] where this
                    Court stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    Given that this appeal largely involves the
                            evaluation of the Judge's finding of facts below, it is apposite that we
                            remind ourselves of an appellate court's role with respect to the
                            finding of facts made in the course of a trial. The appellate court's
                            power of review with respect to finding of facts is limited because the
                            trial judge is generally better placed to assess the veracity and
                            credibility of witnesses, especially where oral evidence is concerned
                                (<em>Seah Ting Soon v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte
                                Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [22]). However, this rule
                            is not immutable. Where it can be established that the trial judge's
                            assessment is plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, the
                            appellate court can and should overturn any such finding (see <em>Alagappa Subramanian v Chidambaram s/o Alagappa</em>
                            [2003] SGCA 20 at [13] and <em>Jagatheesan
                                </em><em>s/o Krishnasamy v PP</em> [2006]
                            4 SLR(R) 45 at [34] – [36]). Furthermore, where a
                            particular finding of fact is not based on the veracity or credibility
                            of the witness, but instead, is based on an inference drawn from the
                            facts or the evaluation of primary facts, the appellate court is in as
                            good a position as the trial judge to undertake that exercise (<em>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                            3 SLR(R) 307 at [54] and <em>Ho Soo Fong v Standard
                                Chartered Bank</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 181 at [20]). In so
                            doing, the appellate court will evaluate the cogency of the evidence
                            given by the witnesses by testing it against inherent probabilities or
                            against uncontroverted facts (<em>Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng
                                Leong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 939 at [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, a finding of fact is subject to appellate intervention where
                    it is plainly wrong or unjustified by the totality of the evidence
                    (“findings of fact test”). The “exceptional
                    circumstances” test as articulated in <em>The
                        Macgregor</em> also falls within the ambit of the findings of fact
                    test as it is triggered when the trial judge has failed to apply his mind to a
                    material fact or has made an order unsupported by the totality of the evidence.
                    The question then arises as to whether there really can be said to be a
                    separate, higher standard of appellate review for appeals concerning the
                    apportionment of liability among two or more defendants and if so whether such a
                    standard is defensible. A close analysis of the English and Australian positions
                    clarifies that in practice, the threshold of review envisioned for both types of
                    appeals is in fact the same. In other words, a unified approach to the appellate
                    review of findings of fact and apportionment of liability has been
                taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     By way of example, in the English Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>Wells v Mutchmeats Ltd</em> and
                    Another [2006] EWCA Civ 963 (“<em>Wells v
                        Mutchmeats</em>”) at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>,
                    the court quoted Brook LJ’s judgment in <em>Plumb v
                        Lisa Ayres and Ryford Ltd</em>, Court of Appeal transcript [1988]
                    1028/2 of 17 March 1999:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is very firmly established that this court will not interfere with a
                        trial judge's apportionment of responsibility <em>unless it
                            can be shown that he erred in principle, or misapprehended the facts, or
                            he is clearly shown to have been wrong </em><em>…</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, the more recent English Court of Appeal’s decision
                        <em>Woodham v M Turner T/A Turners of Great Barton and
                        Peterborough City Council</em> [2012] EWCA Civ 375, is illustrative of
                    the view that when the appellate court is satisfied that the trial judge erred
                    in his analysis of the evidence in relation to the blameworthiness of the
                    parties, it will intervene. The court remarked at [36] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I appreciate that the appellate court is indeed ordinarily slow to
                        interfere in a question of apportionment in cases of this kind. But in my
                        own view, having regard to his primary findings, the judge simply was wrong
                        to attribute the greater share of responsibility to Miss Turner in the way
                        that he did, and was wrong to assess her overall liability as that of 70 per
                        cent. Moreover, I have concerns that the judge, on the issue of assessing
                        relative responsibility and apportionment, may not have had sufficient
                        regard for those purposes of the potential significance of
                        Mr Gladwish's evidence. I am not able to agree with Mr Ferris's
                        submission that the greater share of responsibility lay with
                        Mr Woodham. In my view, on the facts of this particular case, there was
                        no reason to differentiate between the two in terms of apportionment of
                        responsibility. In my view, the appropriate finding should have been, and
                        is, that Mr Woodham was 50 per cent liable for what happened and
                        Miss Turner was 50 per cent liable for what happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Very recently, in <em>Satnam
                        </em><em>Rehill v Rider Holdings Limited</em>
                    [2012] EWCA Civ 628, the English Court of Appeal discussed the applicable
                    principles of appellate review of apportionment of liability (in contributory
                    negligence) by a lower court. In this case, allowing the appeal in part, the
                    court substituted the apportionment of liability of the lower court from
                    one-third to half. Citing its earlier decision in <em>Karen Janet
                        Eagle (By her Litigation Friend E E Giles) v Garth Maynard
                        Chambers</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 1107 approvingly, the court noted, at
                        [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that the correct place to start is <em>Eagle v Chambers</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 1107 ... In that
                        case the driver had struck a young woman walking at night in the
                        carriageway. The trial judge found that she should bear a greater share of
                        the responsibility for her injures and apportioned her contribution at 60
                        per cent. The Court of Appeal substituted a figure of 40 per cent. Hale LJ,
                        giving the judgment of the court, stated at para [10] that there are two
                        aspects to apportioning responsibility between claimant and defendant,
                        namely the respective causative potency of what they have done and their
                        respective blameworthiness. The court rejected an argument, based on the
                        wording of section 1(1) of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act
                        1945, that the primary focus should be on the claimant's conduct and her
                        share in the responsibility: Hale LJ said at para [14] that realistically
                        the court has to compare the two parties. At para [16] she said this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“We also accept that this court is always reluctant to
                            interfere with the trial judge's judgment of what apportionment between
                            the parties is 'just and equitable' under the 1945 Act. <em>But a finding as to which, if either, of the parties was
                                the more responsible for the damage is different from a finding as
                                to the precise extent of a less than 50 per cent contribution. There
                                is a qualitative difference between a finding of 60 per cent
                                contribution and a finding of 40 per cent which is not so apparent
                                in the quantitative difference between 40 per cent and 20 per
                                cent.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It seems to us that an appellate court ought to intervene in appeals
                    against apportionment of liability when it can be shown that the trial judge
                    erred in principle, misapprehended the facts, or is otherwise clearly shown to
                    have been wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     A similar approach to this issue has been
                    taken in Australia as illustrated by the decision in <em>Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd</em> (1985)
                    59 ALR 529 at [8] where Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and
                    Deane JJ merely observed that such findings would not be reviewed lightly
                    as distinct from belonging to a special category of fact finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A finding on a question of apportionment is a finding upon a
                        “question not of principle or of positive findings of fact or law,
                        but of proportion, of balance and relative emphasis, and of weighing
                        different considerations. It involves an individual choice or discretion, as
                        to which there may well be differences of opinion by different
                        minds”: <em>British Fame (Owners) v MacGregor
                            (Owners)</em> [1943] AC 197, at p 201. <em>Such a finding, if made by a judge, is not lightly reviewed.</em>

<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Macquarie Pathology Services Pty Ltd v
                        Sullivan</em> (Court of Appeal (NSW), 28 March 1995)
                    (unreported), Clarke JA said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well established that a trial judge is invested with a very wide
                        discretion in making his apportionment and that he must be allowed much
                        latitude in arriving at a judgment as to what is just and equitable. In
                        these circumstances the onus cast on an appellant who seeks to disturb an
                        apportionment is a high one ... Obviously where one party can point to an
                        error of fact or of law on the part of the trial judge it may not be
                        difficult to argue that his or her determination as to what is just and
                        equitable may be flawed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     While it is important to clarify the approach
                    taken in <em>The Macgregor</em> as cited in <em>TV Media</em>, it is crucial to also appreciate that findings
                    on apportionment import a large number of discretionary considerations. In
                        <em>C (A Child) v Imperial Design Limited</em> [2001]
                    Env LR 33 at [45]–[46] the English Court of Appeal discussed the comparatively
                    narrower approach taken in <em>The Macgregor</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    It is of course well
                            established that the review by this court of the apportionment by the
                            trial judge is of a very limited nature. As Lord Wright said in
                                <em>British Fame (Owners) v. Macgregor (Owners)
                                </em><em>(The Macgregor)</em> [1942] AC
                            197 at 201:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“… I do repeat that it would require a very strong case
                            to justify any such review of or interference with this matter of
                            apportionment where the same view is taken of the law and the facts. It
                            is a question of the degree of fault, depending on a trained and expert
                            judgment considering all the circumstances, and it is different in
                            essence from a mere finding of fact in the ordinary sense. <em>It is a question, not of principle or of positive findings
                                of fact or law, but of proportion, of balance and relative emphasis,
                                and of weighing different considerations. </em><em>It involves an individual choice or discretion, as to which
                                there may well be differences of opinion by different minds. It is
                                for that reason, I think, that an appellate court has been warned
                                against interfering, save in very exceptional circumstances, with
                                the judge's apportionment.</em> The accepted rule was clearly
                            stated by Lord Buckmaster, with the assent of the other Lords, in
                            Kitano Maru (Owners) v. Otranto (Owners) (The Otranto) [1931] AC 194,
                            204, in these words: ‘<em>Upon the question of
                                altering the share of responsibility each has to take, this is
                                primarily a matter for the judge at the trial, and unless there is
                                some error in law or in fact in his judgment it ought not to be
                                disturbed.’</em> I might add that in The Karamea, [1921]
                            page 76 the Court of Appeal varied the proportion of liability because
                            they took a different view of the facts. Their decision was affirmed by
                            this House: Haugland (Owners) v. Karamea (Owners) [1922] 1 AC
                            68.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    Likewise Viscount
                            Simon LC, at page199, said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“If the trial judge, when distributing blame, could be shown to
                            have misapprehended a vital fact bearing on the matter, that, I think,
                            would be a reason for considering whether a change in the distribution
                            should be made on appeal.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As highlighted in the above excerpt, an
                    appellate court should be mindful of the fact that by reason of the
                    discretionary nature of apportionment, wherein the identified causes of damage
                    cannot be clearly attributed to either party, often there is no intelligible way
                    of distinguishing between why a trial judge ordered, for example, 25% and not
                    40% of the liability to be borne by one party. In such cases, the appellate
                    court ought not to readily intervene on the basis that it would have exercised
                    its discretion differently had it decided the matter as a first instance court.
                    That said the review of apportionment discretion should not be made impossible.
                    Judges are obliged to justify their determinations on apportionment with clear
                    reasoning (see <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 676 at [14]–[46]). Particularly, where the apportionment decision of the
                    trial judge is supported by cogent reasons alluding to the interaction of the
                    respective parties’ individual culpability in a myriad of identified
                    causes from which the damages flowed, the appellate court should be slow to
                    intervene. The phrase “exceptional circumstances” used in
                        <em>The Macgregor</em> should be understood in the
                    light of the real concerns surrounding the disturbing of discretionary decisions
                    of the trial judge. Having said that, it is clear that the threshold of
                    appellate review of apportionment of liability in England and Australia is the
                    same as that concerning a finding of fact, <em>ie</em>,
                    when the apportionment was plainly wrong or unjustified on the totality of the
                    evidence before the trial judge. We endorse this approach. In the circumstances,
                    the law on appellate review of apportionment of liability as stated by this
                    Court in <em>TV Media</em> should be read in light of our
                    clarifications here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>We reiterate that the
                        principal objective of the appellate process must be to do justice by
                        correcting plainly wrong decisions. This function, a constitutional
                        responsibility of this Court, is a necessary pre-requisite to ensuring
                        </em>
<em>that public confidence in the administration
                        of justice is maintained. A proper balance has therefore to be struck by
                        appellate courts between due deference and undue deference in relation to
                        </em>
<em>findings of fact (and apportionment) by trial
                        courts. </em>
<em>Arid historical distinctions between
                        correctable errors of law and irretrievable errors of fact no longer
                        resonate. Improvements to the record, such as verbatim transcripts that are
                        electronically recorded, now permit closer appellate review of findings of
                        fact by trial courts. The trial judge’s notes are no longer the only
                        reliable record of what has transpired below. With this development, some of
                        the previously exclusive advantages of triers of fact have
                        shrunk.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We return to the facts. The appellant argued
                    that the apportionment of liability by the Judge in the present case was not
                    just and equitable as the location of the WDU at the WDU Area was the
                    predominant cause of the damage to the paintings in the Art Gallery; which
                    Liquid Advertising was allegedly solely responsible for. For the reasons stated
                    above at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>, Liquid Advertising and the appellant were <em>both</em> responsible for the location of the WDU in the WDU
                    Area. Also, it was precisely because of the absence of clear evidence to
                    establish whether the Water Inlet Hose (<em>ie</em>,
                    hydrolytic degradation and Helical Line Feature) or the location of the WDU at
                    the WDU Area was the predominant cause, that the Judge held that Liquid
                    Advertising and the appellant were jointly liable and held that all three causes
                    contributed to Ho See Jui’s damages. The appellant was found to bear a
                    greater percentage of the liability for its greater responsibility in relation
                    to all three identified causes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The appellant’s alternative submission
                    that the Judge erred in finding that the hydrolytic degradation and the Helical
                    Line Feature were two separate causes was a non-starter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The hydrolytic
                    degradation occurred because the appellant had selected and supplied a hose
                    which was made of material unsuitable for the carriage of water. The Helical
                    Line Feature was a manufacturing feature of the hose which was exacerbated by
                    the improper use of the installed hose intended for the carriage of air rather
                    than water. No evidence was led to establish that the hose would have ruptured
                    notwithstanding the Helical Line Feature or vice-versa, negating the element of
                    causation for one of the identified causes. The Judge was correct in defining
                    the causes separately. In any event, the appellant’s complaint did not
                    further its cause as <em>even if</em> as per the
                    appellant’s suggestion the unsuitable material of the Water Inlet Hose and
                    the location of installation of the WDU were the only two operative causes,
                    apportionment would have been varied to the advantage of Liquid Advertising. The
                    very fact that the appellant was found to be responsible for both causes as
                    compared with Liquid Advertising which was specifically found <em>only</em> to be liable for its responsibility in relation to one of
                    the causes pointed to apportionment in Liquid Advertising’s
                favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Accordingly, in light of the discretionary
                    nature of apportionment and the lack of any clear evidence of error, the
                    apportionment of liability by the Judge was not disturbed.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     While the Rules set out the necessary
                    procedure, as observed by Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Checkpoint
                        Fluidic Systems International Ltd v Marine Hub Pte Ltd and Another
                        Appeal</em> [2009] SGHC 134, it is trite law that indemnity can arise
                    from contract, express or implied, or by conduct. A right to indemnity arises
                    where the relationship between the parties is such that either in law or in
                    equity there is an obligation upon one party to indemnify the other.
                    Chao JA quoted Lord Wrenbury’s observations in the Privy Council
                    decision of <em>Eastern Shipping Company, Limited v Quah
                        </em><em>Beng </em><em>Kee</em> [1924] AC 177 at 182–183 are particularly instructive.
                    Lord Wrenbury stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A right to indemnity generally arises from contract express or implied,
                        but it is not confined to cases of contract. A right to indemnity exists
                        where the relation between the parties is such that either in law or in
                        equity there is an obligation upon the one party to indemnify the other.
                        There are, for instance, cases in which the state of circumstances is such
                        that the law attaches a legal or equitable duty to indemnify arising from an
                        assumed promise by a person to do that which, under the circumstances, he
                        ought to do. The right to indemnify need not arise by contract ; it may (to
                        give other instances) arise by statute ; it may arise upon the notion of a
                        request made under circumstances from which the law implies that the common
                        intention is that the party requested shall be indemnified by the party
                        requesting him ; it may arise (to use Lord Eldon’s words in
                            <em>Waring v Ward</em> [7 Ves 332, 336]; a case of
                        vendor and purchaser) in cases in which the Court will “independent
                        of contract raise upon his (the purchaser’s) conscience an obligation
                        to indemnify the vendor against the personal obligation” of the
                        vendor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Appellant did not owe an obligation to indemnify Liquid Advertising
                under the Reinstallation Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Judge ordered the appellant to indemnify
                    Liquid Advertising’s 30% (to be assessed) on the basis of the breach of
                    implied terms of the Reinstallation Agreement. The implied terms identified
                    pursuant to the SGA were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Water Inlet Hose supplied under
                        the contract for reinstallation of the WDU was to be of satisfactory
                        quality; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     the said Water Inlet Hose was to be reasonably fit for its purpose of the
                        carriage of water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, on the
                    Judge’s reasoning, it is cardinal that the obligation to indemnify arises
                    from the contractual agreement between the parties. It is clear that the breach
                    of the above-mentioned terms relates squarely to the first and second causes
                    identified by the Judge, namely (a) the hydrolytic degradation of the Water
                    Inlet Hose and the (b) Helical Line Feature. It is also important to note
                    that the Judge <em>did not</em> find that Liquid
                    Advertising was responsible for these causes. Rather, she clearly stated that
                    Liquid Advertising’s liability under all three causes of action was
                    premised <em>solely</em> on its responsibility in directing
                    the appellants to install the WDU in the WDU Area rather than the more suitable
                    wet pantry area (<em>ie</em>, the third cause). The
                    Reinstallation Agreement did not relate to the location of installation of the
                    WDU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     While the appellant owed contractual duties to
                    Liquid Advertising consisting of the implied terms stated above, capable of
                    construction as an implied indemnity, as Liquid Advertising’s liability
                    was not premised on the above breaches or obligations, the question arose as to
                    why the appellant was obliged to indemnify Liquid Advertising in the first
                    place. It is trite law that a narrow construction should be adopted in the
                    context of implied indemnities. The location of the installation rather than the
                    material used for the Water Inlet Hose could not be read into the implied
                    obligations upon the appellant of “satisfactory quality” and
                    “fitness for purpose”. Alternatively, the Judge could have
                    considered an indemnity on the basis of breaches of the Third Maintenance
                    Contract which would have related more closely to the cause founding Liquid
                    Advertising’s liability, giving rise to an obligation to indemnify on the
                    part of the appellant. While Liquid Advertising pleaded the Maintenance
                    Contracts as a basis for their contractual indemnity claim, the Third
                    Maintenance Contract expired on 21 June 2007, prior to the rupture of the
                    Water Inlet Hose (above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). Thus the
                    indemnity could not have been founded on this basis either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Accordingly, Liquid Advertising’s
                    application for an indemnity was erroneously founded on the basis of breaches of
                    the above-mentioned implied terms which <em>did not</em>
                    mirror or relate to the liability incurred by Liquid Advertising. In effect, the
                    appellant was ordered to indemnify Liquid Advertising for the breach of an
                    obligation which it did not owe to it under the scope of the implied terms of
                    the Reinstallation Agreement. The lack of congruity between the obligations owed
                    by the appellant and the liability incurred by Liquid Advertising required the
                    Judge’s order of indemnity to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Accordingly, the appeal was allowed partially
                    with Liquid Advertising bearing 30% of the liability for the damage caused to Ho
                    See Jui. The order as to costs was also varied to reflect the apportionment of
                    liability at 30% by Liquid Advertising and 70% by the appellant.</p>
