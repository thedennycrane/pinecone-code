</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) JOS Annex A Item 2 – injuries related to left biceps and shoulder</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Mr Wee claims $17,000 for the injuries related to his left biceps and shoulder, whereas the defendant submits that he is only entitled to $10,000. I award $15,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mr Wee’s injuries were left subscapularis tendinopathy and a near full thickness tear of the anterior to mid fibres of the left supraspinatus tendon. Counsel for the plaintiffs drew a comparison with <span class="font-italic">Ting Heng Mee v </span><span class="font-italic">Sin Shing Fresh Fruit Pte Ltd</span> [2004] SGHC 43 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Heng Mee</span>”), where the claimant was awarded $13,500 for a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon with biceps tendinopathy on his left shoulder. He submitted that the extent of his injury was greater than that in <span class="font-italic">Ting Heng Mee</span>. I note that in the latter case it was observed that “by the time the [claimant] returned for review, the pain had resolved, and the shoulder movement was fairly good and painless.” (see <span class="font-italic">Ting Heng Mee</span> at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In comparison, according to the 30 July 2019 report of Dr Michael Yam (“Dr Yam”), Senior Resident in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Mr Wee’s symptoms “had improved with physiotherapy” some nine months after the accident. I note that Dr Yam did not say that the symptoms had resolved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) JOS Annex A Item 3 – cervical and lumbar spondylosis</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In Dr Yam’s 30 July 2019 Medical Report, he identified “cervical &amp; lumbar spondylosis” in his diagnosis of Mr Wee’s injuries (the “back injuries”). Mr Wee claims $8,000 for these injuries. The defendant initially asserted that the back injuries were not attributable to the accident but were due to pre-existing degeneration. This was untenable given that the 30 July 2019 Medical Report noted “back contusion”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, bruising on the back.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 During cross-examination, counsel for the defendant sought Dr Yam’s agreement that the accident did not cause but merely aggravated the allegedly pre-existing degeneration. Quite properly, Dr Yam declined for the reason that there was no evidence of pre-existing degeneration. He therefore concluded that the back injuries were wholly caused by the Accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I allow Mr Wee’s claim of $8,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) JOS Annex A Item 7 – pre-trial loss of earnings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Mr Wee claims $90,000 for pre-trial loss of earnings based on a monthly income of $1,800 for 50 months from July 2017 to August 2021. He adduced evidence from bank statements showing a monthly cash deposit of $1,473 on average. Whilst the monthly cash deposit fell short of $1,800, the shortfall was accounted for by Mr Wee’s explanation that he did not bank in all his earnings but kept some cash on hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Wee gave evidence that he would have continued operating the canteen stall with his wife if the Accident had not occurred. They had been in the hawker business for 40 years operating canteen stalls at various locations. He was 72 years old at the time of the accident and maintained that he would have continued working until he no longer had strength. Dr Yam, during cross-examination, opined that Mr Wee could have continued to work up to whatever age he desired. He maintained his position despite counsel for the defendant suggesting otherwise on account of Mr Wee’s osteoarthritis of the knee, which was not caused by the Accident.  Mr Wee agreed under cross-examination that the number of people patronising his stall during the COVID-19 pandemic would be fewer; but of course, there was no possibility of adducing any evidence as to the percentage decrease.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant mounted several objections to Mr Wee’s claim for loss of earnings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 First, counsel for the defendant argued that the real reason Mr Wee did not continue to work after the accident was that his wife, who was the main cook at the canteen stall that they ran together, was incapacitated as a result of the Accident. He submitted that such circumstance could not constitute the basis of Mr Wee’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings. It had to be shown that the injuries suffered by Mr Wee himself had resulted in his inability to work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 If Mr Wee himself had not suffered any injuries, the defendant’s contention would be valid. The truth, however, is that Mr Wee was injured too. Although the extent of Mr Wee’s injuries was not such as to render him physically unable to work altogether (even with the pre-existing knee problem), it made him practically unemployable. At his age and hampered by his inability to carry heavy things by reason of his left shoulder and back injuries as well as his difficulty standing for long owing to his knee problem, it strains credibility that he would have been able to secure employment, for example, as a hawker assistant to someone else. While there is no evidence that Mr Wee had tried unsuccessfully to gain such employment, in the circumstances, I accept that he would more likely than not have failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The second objection to Mr Wee’s claim was that any inability to work might also have been contributed to by osteoarthritis of the left knee which, Dr Yam had confirmed, was a new complaint in 2018 and therefore not attributable to the accident. However, as Dr Yam opined under cross-examination, Mr Wee could have continued to work up to whatever age he desired in spite of the knee problem.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In theory, (but for the injuries he himself sustained in the accident) Mr Wee could have continued to work after his wife was incapacitated. It is a matter of conjecture what he would have been able to earn in that compromised physical condition, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with osteoarthritis of the knee. It is incapable of proof since we cannot turn the clock back to before the accident to obtain empirical evidence as to the amount of wages he could have earned. This is through no fault of his. For this reason, the defendant’s argument that the Mr Wee has not discharged the evidential burden of strict proof must be tempered by the special circumstances of the case where through no fault of his, proof is impossible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In <span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin </span><span class="font-italic">and another and another appeal</span> [2019] I SLR 230 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Fong Yvonne</span>”) the Court of Appeal opined at [44]–[46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 We do not think that an adherence to established principles will make it unduly onerous for plaintiffs who find themselves in exceptional circumstances which make it difficult to precisely prove and quantify loss of earnings. The courts do not and will not rigidly or invariably demand the same type or amount of evidence in every claim for lost earnings, but will consider all the circumstances of each case in determining whether the evidence that is available satisfies the court that the loss can be proved on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 We illustrate this with an example. In <span class="font-italic">Zaiton Bee Bee bte Abdul Majeed v Chan Poh Teong</span> [2010] 3 SLR 697 (“<span class="font-italic">Zaiton Bee Bee</span>”), the plaintiff was a henna artist who met with a traffic accident and sustained injuries which affected her level of productivity and the number of hours she could put into teaching henna each day: a [57]. Judith Prakash J recognized the difficulties in quantifying the plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings and the limitations in the plaintiff’s evidence, but nonetheless recognized that the plaintiff had incurred losses in the first two years after the accident during which she was unable to work. The AR below had awarded the plaintiff $46,000 per year for pre-trial loss of earnings, with reference to the plaintiff’s income tax assessments, but Prakash J found that this figure was too low given the plaintiff’s enterprising spirit and the evidence of continuing business enquiries. However, it also would not have been fair to award the plaintiff $92,000 per year, which represented the profits earned for a full year’s work, because the evidence indicated that the nature of her business was more casual in nature and not so sustained as to generate a full year’s profits. Prakash J found it appropriate to take the average between $46,000 and $92,000, which yielded a “mid-figure of $69,000 a year [which] would not be unreasonable based on the available evidence”: at [65]. Hence, the plaintiff was awarded $138,000 for pre-trial loss of earnings over the two years during which she was unable to work.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 Despite the inherent difficulties in quantifying the loss incurred by the plaintiff prior to the date of trial, the court in <span class="font-italic">Zaiton Bee Bee</span> nonetheless found it possible to award the plaintiff special damages for pre-trial loss of earnings in a sum which it considered to be fair in all the circumstances and justified by the available evidence. This adequately met the requirement that special damages must be strictly proved: see Wee Sia Tian ([31] supra) at [15]-[16] and the State Court practitioner’s guide, Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“the Practitioner’s Guide on Assessment of Damages”) at para 1-8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Fong Yvonne</span> went on to clarify at [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 Accordingly, we are not concerned that the law will be too strict by compensating plaintiffs only for their pre-trial loss of earnings (and as a matter for special damages) and not diminished earning capacity. We further clarify that the requirement of strict proof for special damages does not mean that the plaintiff must meet a higher legal burden of proof than a balance of probabilities, only that the loss must be specially pleaded and proved: see <span class="font-italic">Rahman Lutfar v Scanpile Constructors Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGHC 41 at [13]: O 18 r 12(1A) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Happily in response to my request for further submissions, the parties have been able to agree on reference being made to the Ministry of Manpower’s Occupational Wage Tables, 30 June 2020 (the “Occupational Wage Tables”) as a helpful starting point in determining the measure of Mr Wee’s loss of earnings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The parties also agree that the occupation of “Food/Drink stall assistant” and “Kitchen assistant” would be closest to that of Mr Wee as a canteen stall assistant. As between the two, the type of work that bears a closer resemblance to the work that Mr Wee was accustomed to would be that of a “Kitchen assistant”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Given Mr Wee’s age, in my view he should be within the 25th percentile rather than the median or 75th percentile. The applicable basic wage per month is therefore $1,300 according to Table 4.5 of the Occupational Wage Tables.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I agree with the defendant that further reduction should be made to take into account his knee problem (which was not caused by the accident). Unlike the defendant, however, I do not consider it reasonable to reduce the $1,300 by half. That would leave Mr Wee with a paltry notional salary of $650 per month which, in my view, is wholly unrealistic. I consider that a 10% reduction would be more appropriate, leaving Mr Wee with a notional salary of $1,170 per month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I therefore award Mr Wee loss of pre-trial earnings for the period from July 2017 to August 2021 (a total of 50 months) in the amount of $58,500.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) JOS Annex A Item 8 – loss of future earnings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 To determine the appropriate multiplier, reference is made to <span class="font-italic">Actuarial Tables with Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury </span><span class="font-italic">and Death Claims</span> (Singapore Academy of Law, 2021) (the “Actuarial Tables”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Based on the Actuarial Tables, the multiplier is 4.66 years.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As regards this, I have already referred to the opinion of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Fong Yvonne</span> (see [22] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 There is no doubt that Mdm Yew suffered pre-trial loss of earnings. While admittedly the evidence as to the estimate of monthly earnings is sparse, it would be unjust to insist that more has to be provided when no record of her daily takings exists. In light of the inherent difficulties in quantifying the loss, the Court has to do what it can to arrive at a sum which is fair taking account of the available evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As a starting point, I do not consider $1,800 a month excessive. Neither has the Defendant suggested that it is. Under cross-examination, Mdm Yew came across as a credible witness. Her explanation that she did not deposit all her takings is understandable. She had to retain some of the money for household and living expenses. The POSB statements of account do not show frequent withdrawals which one would expect to see if the entirety of the takings were deposited and only withdrawn when needed. In fact, withdrawals were few and far between.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, it is fair that the estimate has to be reduced to take account of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems fair to assume that if Mdm Yew had continued to operate her stall during the pandemic, her takings would likely have been reduced. In the round, I will adopt a 20% discount for the period of 17 months from April 2020 to the end of the pre-trial period in August 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, the pre-trial loss of earnings is the aggregate of ($1,800 x 33) and ($1440 x 17), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $83,880 and I award the same.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">General damages</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) JOS Annex B Item 27 – loss of future earnings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As set out in the JOS, Mdm Yew’s claim is premised on her working till the age of 82 years. Dr Tjan Soon Yin (“Dr Tjan”), Senior Consultant in the Department of Rehab Medicine and Pain Management Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, gave evidence under cross-examination that in his view, but for the Accident, Mdm Yew would have been able to work until 82 years of age.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 However, Mdm Yew’s own evidence at trial became somewhat unclear under cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Initially she confirmed that she was claiming for loss of income until age 82 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 However, counsel for the defendant went on to ask as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Would you agree with me that now that you are 70---now that you are---</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: 73 now, right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q ---73, you know, giving you another 6 more years to work up to 79 years old would be realistic. Do you agree? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Court then reminded counsel that the question should not be premised on her present physical condition but rather as she was before the accident. In other words, but for the accident, would she have intended to work only up to the age of 79 years?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Counsel rephrased his question thus: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q If the accident had not happened, you know, do you agree that 70--- do you agree that 70---sorry. 70---I think, yes. Do you agree that 78 years old would be a fair age to retire? Noting especially the requirements of your job. Without the accident, we are talking about.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Agree. Of course, if nothing happens to me, I will work till 78 or even beyond 78 years old, if I am able to continue working. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further on, in response to counsel for the defendant’s put question that she had not given positive evidence that she would be able to work up to 82 years of age, Mdm Yew replied:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A Yes. What I mean is that, if I’m strong enough, I would work up to the age of 82 years old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 After counsel for the plaintiffs had re-examined Mdm Yew, the Court sought her clarification as to the age at which she would have retired but for the accident. Surprisingly her reply was as follows, “I am not able to think. I am feeling painful in some….in different parts of my body. Then I do with 78.”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 She went on to say as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yes, I accept 78. I can’t ask for more. I wish to go home earlier. I am now in pain. My leg is numb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, under further re-examination with the Court’s leave, this exchange took place:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q …So you think 80 years old is a fair age to retire if not for the accident?”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A 80 or 82 is a fair age.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In these circumstances, I think it would be fair to take 80 years, (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the mean between 78 and 82) as the age at which she would have retired but for the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Based on Table 2-8 of the Actuarial Tables, the applicable multiplier is 6.68 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As for the multiplicand, as was done earlier, a discount has to be given in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not possible to say for how long the pandemic will continue. Whilst it might seem improbable that the negative economic impact would last for the entire 6.68 years, it could very well continue for another 2 years. In the round, assuming this to be the case, a discount to the multiplicand of 20% for first 2 years would in my view be fair. The multiplicand for the remaining period of 4.68 years will remain at $1,800 per month, and the loss of future earnings will therefore be ($1440 x 2 x 12) + ($1800 x 4.68 x 12) yielding $135,648 in the aggregate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Pain and suffering</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) JOS Annex B Item 1 – major depressive disorder</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Madam Yew claims $20,000 for her major depressive disorder.

She was diagnosed as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. She was initially not keen to start on antidepressants but agreed on Mirtazepine (14 November 2017) as her symptoms were not improving on subsequent follow-up appointments. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">She was followed up regularly as an outpatient and was last reviewed on 7 May 2018. At that time, she [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] although there was some improvement in her overall symptoms, she was still depressed with episodes of sadness and tearfulness (crying). … At that time, she was on Mirtazepine 45 mg once a night. She was given a follow-up appointment in 16 weeks but did not return for that scheduled appointment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant seized upon Mdm Yew’s failure to attend any follow-up appointment after 7 May 2018 or to seek further medical treatment thereafter and argued that by not continuing to take antidepressants, she had failed to mitigate the state of her psychological condition. Her reply was that she found her condition remained the same, despite the medication; she still could not sleep nor eat. Moreover, after taking the medication, she did not have any strength or energy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In fairness, this was not a clear case of a patient refusing medical treatment. Mdm Yew had been treated since 14 November 2017 with regular follow-up until 7 May 2018 but then felt that there had been no improvement. She told the court that she felt she had been taking too much medication in spite of which she remained unable to sleep at night nor eat during the day. Although Dr Ang reported that there was some improvement in Mdm Yew’s overall symptoms, it seems to me unlikely that she would have chosen to discontinue treatment if she thought her condition could improve with the medication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As regards the quantum of damages, $12,000 is clearly too low. The precedent relied upon by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">Law Kin Ying (administratrix of the </span><span class="font-italic">estate of Lo Hon Man) and others v Lim Hong Hock</span> [2015] SGHCR 14 bears no factual resemblance at all to the present case. In that case, the widow and son of the deceased were awarded $10,000 and $4,000 respectively for depression as a result of witnessing the deceased’s accident. It should be noted, however, that they were also awarded damages for post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the same accident so that in total the widow was awarded $28,000 while the son was awarded $10,000.

</div> He noted that the pain (together with the “phantom pain of her right leg after the above-knee amputation”) had been present since 2017 and that from December 2020, Mdm Yew had reported worsening of the pain despite medication titrations to the degree that her sleep and mood were severely affected. Dr Tjan was of the opinion that “[d]ue to the chronicity of her pain post injury, how it has affected her function and mood; and her need for continuous analgesic management thus far … Mdm Yew’s pain is most unlikely to remit without maintenance medications, and that she will need long term follow up for pain management”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Following her discharge from hospital, Mdm. Yew was reviewed at the Pain Management Clinic on the 6 October 2017 and 10 April 2018. During both consultations, Mdm Yew reported that she was experiencing minimal pain despite having weaned off her analgesia listed above. However, she reported symptoms suggestive of depression with suicidal ideation. A referral was made to Psychiatry to manage her Major Depression and Rehabilitation Medicine Pain Clinic to manage pain which may develop during her Rehabilitation, listed above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Thus, although Mdm Yew did experience severe pain, she later reported only minimal pain during review on 6 October 2017 and 10 April 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Counsel for the plaintiffs did not differentiate between (i) the pain described above at [101]–[103] (which were caused by the multiple injuries she had sustained in the accident and also by the numerous surgeries she had to undergo as a result); and (ii) the phantom limb pain following the right above-knee amputation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Whilst item (i) would appear to have been largely resolved, except for “pain sensitization of her left thigh” which I refer to below, the phantom pain in item (ii) was not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 As late as 7 May 2021, Dr Tjan in his report of that date noted the “phantom pain of her right leg after the above knee amputation” which together with “pain sensitization of her left thigh had been present since 2017”. He further opined, as noted earlier, that her pain was “most unlikely to remit without maintenance medications, and that she will need long term follow up for pain management”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Taking the above into account and the wound infection of the right knee stump on account of which she had to endure further surgeries (see para 3 of Dr Yeo’s report of 25 June 2019), I am of the view that $115,000 would be a fair quantum of damages. I therefore award $115,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) JOS Annex A Item 9 – paroxysmal/supraventricular tachycardia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Based on Dr Chua’s medical report dated 30 July 2019, Mdm Yew suffered a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia (trauma induced). Mdm Yew claims $12,000 for this injury, whereas the defendant takes the position that Mdm Yew is only entitled to $8,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 There is nothing directly on point in the Guidelines.

The defendant disputes that the injury was directly caused by the Accident. The defendant submits that it was an aggravation of a pre-existing degenerative condition for which damages of $2,000 would be fair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Under cross-examination, the evidence of Dr Chua was that the numbness was not directly caused by the Accident as it was not detected or documented during Mdm Yew’s admission to hospital and was later deduced to be due to carpal tunnel syndrome. He described it as a degenerative condition which could be asymptomatic until the patient is injured or if there are other aggravating factors. In response to questions by the Court, Dr Chua was inclined to the view that because of overuse of her arms from getting around, the numbness from the existing carpel tunnel syndrome might have been precipitated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Dr Chua confirmed the correctness of the Court’s understanding that it could have been a pre-existing condition which might have been exacerbated by Mdm Yew being obliged to use her arms more as a result of the accident.

Mdm Yew has been taught fully on the use of manual wheelchair. Her helper is also proven to be competent in assisting her to use the manual wheelchair.

Therefore, I feel the use of a manual wheelchair should be able to perform the functions of helping her to move about both in the community and in the neighbourhood.

If it happens, there would at least be someone around to help me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Therefore, based on Dr Tjan’s final remarks quoted above the claim for the electric wheelchairs cannot be supported.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 However, in para 33 of her AEIC, Mdm Yew also deposed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 “I am currently using a manual wheelchair. However, I intend to purchase an electric wheelchair to use when I go to the market to buy food. At present, when I visit the market, I am not able to buy everything that I want to buy, as my helper cannot carry so many things and at the same time [push] my manual wheelchair. If I am able to purchase an electric wheelchair, I can move around while my helper carries the groceries.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Counsel for the defendant asked Dr Tjan whether, in light of paras 33–34 of Mdm Yew’s AEIC, he would maintain his position. He replied in the affirmative. During re-examination, counsel for the plaintiffs asked Dr Tjan whether it was “reasonable”, as distinct from “necessary”, for Mdm Yew to use an electric wheelchair. He replied that it was a reasonable option in the specific circumstances set out in para 33 of Mdm Yew’s AEIC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Later in response to questions by the Court, Dr Tjan expressed the opinion that a motorised scooter was not the safest thing to use in the cramped conditions in a wet market. He preferred a smaller sized motorised wheelchair.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The cost of a motorised wheelchair is between $600 to $700. Allowing for five changes, the total cost would be up to $3,500. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In addition, the battery packs would require change every 2 years. Based on a multiplier of 15.03 years, there would be 7 changes at $200 each, totaling $1,400.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In the aggregate, I would allow $4,900 for the motorised wheelchairs and battery pack changes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) JOS Annex B Items 22 and 23 – medical consultation and pain medication</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The parties are in agreement as regards the respective multiplicands in respect of these two items but disagree on the multiplier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Whereas the counsel for the plaintiff has adopted a multiplier of 15.03 years (based on Table 2-10 of the Actuarial Tables) that being the number of years from her present age (73 years) till death, counsel for the defendant has argued that the appropriate multiplier is 10.63 years. Counsel for the defendant arrived at this figure apparently on the assumption that the average life expectancy of a female in Singapore is 85 years and using Table 2-9 of the Actuarial Tables.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As between the two tables, Table 2-10 is the appropriate one as it provides the multiplier for the period from start of payment until death. Example 5 in the Actuarial Tables supports the use of Table 2-10. Table 2-9 is used where the cessation of payments is at a pre-determined age, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, upon retirement at 65 years. I see no compelling reason why we should eschew reference to Table 2-10 in favour of an assumption that Mdm Yew’s life will end at 85 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Accordingly, adopting a multiplier of 15.03 years, I would allow $48,081.72 comprising the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $144 x 15.03 = $2,164.32 for medical consultation; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $3,055.05 x 15.03 = $45,917.40 for pain medication.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) JOS Annex B Item 24 – cost of future care</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Having considered the evidence at the hearing, defendant concedes that the multiplicand should be $1,200 per month. However, the defendant maintains that the multiplier should be 10.63.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 As I have already decided that the appropriate multiplier is 15.03 (see [152] above), the quantum of damages for this item is allowed at $216,432.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) JOS Annex B Item 25 – future transport expenses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The parties have agreed on $1,500 for future transport expenses. I therefore allow $1,500 for this item.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In
