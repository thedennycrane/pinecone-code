The fact that sales were in the US would not have signalled on its own a US COMI: sales may occur in an entirely different country from where the creditors and other third party observers would expect the centre of gravity to be. Similarly, that the primary assets of the first applicant at present (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, its IP rights) may be registered in the US is not a significant determinant: assets may be held in various countries, and the place of registration would not preclude dealings in those assets in other countries. I do not think that any creditor would have been influenced by the location of the registration of such rights.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Similarly, the fact that the second applicant is a US citizen, or may have been largely present in the US, would not also point definitively to the US as the first applicant’s COMI. In this regard, there was little evidence that would have been available to third parties demonstrating that operational decisions of the first applicant were being made in the US. I could not see that any creditor would regard the US as the centre of gravity of the first applicant simply because of the second applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On the other hand, the fact that creditor meetings were held in Singapore or Hong Kong would not seem to help either. These may have been entirely fortuitous or arranged for the convenience of some of the first applicant’s creditors. Furthermore, it would appear that funds were raised by the first applicant from creditors in a number of jurisdictions including Singapore, the US, Hong Kong, China and the United Kingdom, to name a few.

</div> Any alleged non-compliance is a matter solely for the US courts, and is immaterial and irrelevant in Singapore under present law.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The Singapore courts do not compel compliance with foreign injunctions; neither do the Singapore courts expect foreign courts to enforce its injunctions or moratoria. What assistance can be rendered to the US Chapter 11 Proceedings is another matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assistance under the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 From the findings above, assistance would be available on the basis that the US Chapter 11 Proceedings are recognised as a foreign non-main proceeding. The scope of such assistance is not necessarily narrower than that for foreign main proceedings. Under Art 20 of the Model Law, a moratorium automatically operates upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding. In comparison, under Art 21 of the Model Law, the court may in respect of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, grant any appropriate relief where necessary to protect the property of the debtor company or the interests of its creditors, including: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the debtor’s property, rights, obligations or liabilities, to the extent they have not been stayed under Article 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) staying execution against the debtor’s property to the extent it has not been stayed under Article 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any property of the debtor to the extent this right has not been suspended under Article 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) providing for examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the debtor’s property, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) entrusting the administration or realisation of all or part of the debtor’s property located in Singapore to the foreign representative or another person designated by the Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) extending relief granted under Article 19(1); and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) granting any additional relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder, including any relief provided under section 227D(4) of this Act [in respect of a Judicial Management order].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The primary difference is thus that in respect of foreign non-main proceedings, stays and other orders are granted at the discretion of the court. In exercising such discretion, the court will be mindful of a number of considerations. The general inclination would be to grant such orders to assist the foreign representative in the performance of her functions to the same degree and extent as would be granted to a local insolvency representative. This would serve the objectives of modified universalism as endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Beluga</span><span class="font-italic"> Chartering GmbH (in liquidation) and others v Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another (deugro (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party) </span>[2014] 2 SLR 815. That inclination would be displaced where factors point to the need to address any overriding interests within the jurisdiction, such as possible societal concerns or employee rights, for instance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Assistance of a particular form may not be granted if in the same circumstances it may be denied or is not available to a local representative. This issue was considered by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Fibria Celulose S/A v Pan Ocean Co Ltd and another</span> [2014] Bus LR 1041. The court found that the phrase “any appropriate relief” in Art 21(1) of the Model Law did not extend to the granting of relief which would not have been available when dealing with a domestic insolvency (at [108]). Such a reading is also supported by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with Guide to Enactment and Interpretation (2013) <http: 1997-model-law-insol-2013-guide-enactment-e.pdf="" english="" insolven="" pdf="" texts="" www.uncitral.org=""> (accessed 19 November 2019) (“the 2013 Guide”), where para 189 states that “the court is not restricted unnecessarily in its ability to grant any type of relief that is available <span class="font-italic">under the law of the enacting State</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>…” [emphasis added]. </http:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Further, as is noted in the Cross-Border Insolvency: Guide to Enactment of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, UNCITRAL, 30th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/442 (1997) at para 158, the interests and authority of a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding are typically narrower than those of a representative of a foreign main proceeding; care should be taken to avoid giving unnecessarily broad powers to the foreign representative of a foreign non-main proceeding which may interfere with the administration of another insolvency proceeding, particularly a main proceeding elsewhere. But these are questions for another day, as the parties here do not contest these points.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The following may be ordered in the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a moratorium on the commencement of proceedings against the first applicant, save for the qualifications to be dealt with below (at [31]–[40]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an order that no resolution may be passed for the winding up of the first applicant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an order that no execution, distress or other legal process may be commenced, continued or levied against any property of the first applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The primary difficulty relates to the orders sought concerning the barring of the transfer of shares in the first applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Barring the transfer of shares in the first applicant in OS 544/2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The applicants point to s 259 of the CA as showing that a moratorium can be granted to prevent the transfer of shares in the first applicant. This is raised in the context of the applicants’ arguments that OS 544/2019 should be stayed, with the result that TGL is prevented from enforcing the share charge over shares in the second applicant held by GIL (see [5] above).

Where winding up has commenced, any change of the membership of the company or transfer of its shares would go against the freezing of the position of the company as at the point of winding up by the court. The primary objective appears to be to maintain the status quo: see Ian Fletcher, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Insolvency </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2017) at para 26-004. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As s 259 of the CA is concerned with winding up by the court, and is intended to preserve the position on liquidation, it does not provide any indication or guidance as to whether any similar prohibition should be part of the assistance given to a foreign insolvency representative under the Model Law.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Here, the moratorium sought against the share transfer is clearly intended to head off any change in control of the first applicant, and hence the restructuring effort. There is no apparent reason why the Singapore courts should step in to prevent such an event. It may be that any such share transfer would be contrary to the stay imposed in the US Chapter 11 Proceedings (though the non-parties argue that it is not), but that in itself does not require that the Singapore courts similarly bar that transfer.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The point of the assistance in the Model Law is to ensure the orderly and equitable distribution of assets and to facilitate the process of restructuring wherever possible. It is not intended to protect or preserve a party’s position within the company in the case of a dispute between shareholders, or to prevent a different view being taken subsequently in the foreign proceedings about the direction of the restructuring, or whether restructuring efforts should even be maintained. Thus, the assistance in Singapore cannot be directed to prevent the transfer of shares in the first applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In addition, the fact that the parties have subjected the debts in respect of which the share charge over the first applicant’s shares was given by GIL to TGL to dispute resolution, with a determination having been made, would be a factor pointing against any stay or moratorium by the court, especially where no assets or property of the first applicant that would otherwise be available to the general pool of creditors is at stake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In this context therefore, the possibility of the second applicant being displaced from control over the first applicant is a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span> to the protection of and consolidation of assets that would be at the core of the assistance rendered under the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It can be argued that the US Chapter 11 Proceedings would be effectively negated because of the change of control of the first applicant that would follow from the displacement of the second applicant. This may indeed be a possible consequence, but I do not understand the Model Law to require that a recognising court preserve and protect the foreign proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It follows from the above discussion that a stay is not imposed on the proceedings in OS 544/2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Enforcement of S 252/2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Both the applicants and the non-parties took the position in the hearing before me that the proceedings in S 252/2019 should be allowed to proceed against AE and GIL, while enforcement of the summary judgment obtained against the first applicant in those proceedings should be stayed (see [5] above). It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider whether S 252/2019 should be carved out of any moratorium imposed on the commencement or continuation of legal proceedings against the first applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recognition of the foreign representative</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The non-parties argue that the second applicant should not be recognised as the foreign representative.

Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether a foreign main proceeding or a foreign non-main proceeding, where necessary to protect the property of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, the Court may,<span class="font-italic"> at the request of the foreign representative</span>, grant any appropriate relief, including —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) entrusting the administration or realisation of all or party of the debtor’s property located in Singapore to the foreign representative or another person designated by the Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Two observations can be made about the wording of the provision. First, the application for relief is to be made by the foreign representative. Second, the provision entitles the court to entrust the administration or realisation of the debtor’s property to a person other than the foreign representative. Nothing in the provision suggests that the court may, of its own accord, decide to appoint a different person as the foreign representative of a foreign proceeding. In contrast, I find that the wording of Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Model Law actually suggests that the foreign representative cannot be displaced, even if the court is of the view that the interests of local creditors might be better served by having some other person administer or realise the locally-based assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 That being said, I should state that I have some concerns that the second applicant, in acting as the first applicant’s foreign representative, may not discharge his duties even-handedly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Here, the dispute between the parties appears to have gone beyond the background level of litigation that is often a part of modern business life.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>The actions taken by the second applicant on behalf of the first applicant have brought him into direct conflict with its creditors. The second applicant’s actions in causing the first applicant to bring an arbitration disputing the debts owed to TGL caused the latter to incur significant costs (see [44] above). It appears that there was little evidence in support of the first applicant’s claims in the arbitration, with the final award noting that the claim was “largely without merit”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There is also the fact that the second applicant has been adjudged bankrupt in the US, which would bar him from acting as a director of the first applicant here. Such disqualification is provided for by s 148 of the CA, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restrictions on undischarged bankrupt</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">148.</span>—(1) Every person who, being an undischarged bankrupt (whether he was adjudged bankrupt by a Singapore Court or a foreign court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy), acts as director of, or directly or indirectly takes part in or is concerned in the management of any corporation, except with the leave of the Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The prohibition against bankrupts acting as insolvency officers here is founded on local policy considerations. A person who is an undischarged bankrupt is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> not fit to take part in the management of a company, especially one with limited liability: see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Tan Cheng Han gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 7.39. There is no evidence before the court that the second applicant had made such an application to the court or the Official Assignee under s 148(2) of the CA to allow him to continue acting as a director of the first applicant despite his disqualification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Finally, there is the issue of the second applicant’s wilful disobedience of Singapore court orders. Following the hearing of the present application, the second applicant was, on 11 November 2019, found guilty on three charges of contempt by disobedience and sentenced to a fine of $20,000 by Pang Khang Chau J.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 To my mind, these factors taken together demonstrate that the second applicant is ill-suited to adequately protect the interests of the first applicant’s creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the circumstances, given the limitations of the Model Law, the second applicant will continue to act as the foreign representative recognised by the US Chapter 11 Proceedings. Though I am minded to appoint a different person to oversee any assets of the first applicant located in Singapore, there is no evidence that any such assets exist. For the avoidance of doubt, however, I would require a specific application for leave from the applicants before any steps are taken to oversee any such assets. I also note that court to court communications with the court overseeing the US Chapter 11 Proceedings to explore how the interests of overseas and local creditors can be protected may be explored, if needed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Common law recognition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The applicants alternatively invoke common law recognition as a basis on which OS 544/2019 can be stayed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I do not consider that common law recognition is available in the present case. In general, where the Model Law is applicable to the subject matter, the court would be slow to allow common law recognition to be invoked as an alternative. The existence of a detailed recognition regime created by legislation displaces the need for common law doctrine to apply. Thus, in most, if not all, foreign corporate insolvency proceedings, recognition should be made under the Model Law. The invocation of the common law should only be for situations where recognition is not catered for by the Model Law, which would appear to be highly unlikely given its structure. I would thus see the scope for common law recognition to be limited to foreign personal bankruptcy proceedings, and little else besides.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Recognition is granted to the US Chapter 11 Proceedings as foreign non-main proceedings, with assistance granted as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a moratorium on the commencement of proceedings against the first applicant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an order that no resolution may be passed for the winding up of the first applicant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an order that no execution, distress or other legal process may be commenced, continued or levied against any property of the first applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For the avoidance of doubt, the moratorium in (a) does not apply to TGL’s application in OS 544/2019 against GIL to enforce its share charge over the first applicant’s shares. The stay of proceedings similarly does not apply to proceedings brought by TGL in S 252/2019 to enforce guarantees given to it by AE and GIL for the first applicant’s debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Cost directions will be given separately, and time for any appeal or other application is extended in the meantime.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tay Kang-Rui Darius, Lee Lieyong Sean and Loh Yu Chin, Deborah (Blackoak LLC) for the applicants;<br/> Mohamed Nawaz Kamil and Lau Hui Ming Kenny (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the non-parties.<br/></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
