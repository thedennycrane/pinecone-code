In contrast, s 395 CPC falls under Part XX Division 2, labelled “Points reserved”. Indeed, this present proceeding was filed as a criminal motion and not as a criminal revision or appeal. The court’s jurisdiction under s 395(5) CPC is hence best characterised as a form of supervisory jurisdiction, similar to that for bail applications.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 A <span class="font-italic">de novo </span>standard of review should be applied. This was implicit in the approach taken by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chee Soon Juan</span>, although the court<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not explicitly address the issue of standard of review. There, the High Court considered the similar issue of whether the District Court had correctly refused an application under s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCA”) to refer a question of constitutional law to the High Court. The High Court found that s 56A SCA was the predecessor to s 395(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) CPC, and went on to lay down a two-step framework on how the State Courts should decide s 395(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) applications (<span class="font-italic">Chee Soon Juan </span>at [29] to [33]). The High Court then went on to apply the two-step framework and concluded that the District Court in that case had correctly refused the s 56A SCA application (at [34]). Importantly, the High Court stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I am of the view that the trial [j]udges made the correct decisions not to stay the respective criminal proceedings in the courts below in order to refer the purported constitutional challenges to the High Court.

The standard of review applicable for criminal revisions (grave and serious injustice) and for criminal appeals (such as wrong decision as to factual matrix; error in appreciating the material; wrong in principle; or manifest error) would not apply in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural Irregularity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I briefly address a procedural irregularity before going into the merits of the application.

While this is not expressly stated in s 395 CPC, there should not be any confusion or doubt about what it is the court should consider, and what the other side is to respond to. Once submitted, any amendment or variation should be raised to the court first. The court should generally allow such change unless injustice or prejudice would occur, such as undue or prolonged delay, or if there has been constant vacillation in the reference question. The merits and likely success of the question posed will also be material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Applicant’s unauthorised amendment in this case did not cause substantial injustice as the State Court had been content to proceed on the Revised Question, and this is the same question before me now ([10] and [11] above). However, in future cases, the court’s leave should be sought before any such amendment. Any unpermitted amendment may lead to the application for reference being dismissed on grounds of abuse of process.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This irregularity seems to be brought up by the Respondent primarily in order to seek costs against Applicant’s counsel, by arguing that he lacks <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>.

The burden is on the party seeking the reference to show that such a relevant question has indeed arisen. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should assess if the question is appropriate to be referred. The question should be a novel legal issue which has not been settled by a superior court. A new factual situation would not be sufficient as new fact permutations will always arise, and in such cases the settled principles can just be applied or extrapolated. The court should also consider the merits of the reference question to determine if it is a genuine one, or a frivolous one meant merely to delay proceedings.  The discretion of the court is properly exercised by not referring questions which are frivolous, made for collateral purposes, to delay, or are otherwise an abuse of process.

</div>
</div> The question of whether the PP had or had not taken into account these alleged factors is a question of fact, being specific only to this case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As stated above at [40], only questions of law pertaining to the interpretation and effect of the Constitution may be raised under s 395(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) CPC. This factual question hence has to be dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 However, it may be said that there is an inherent question of law in the factual question. Inherent in the factual question of whether the PP has breached Art 12(1) by prosecuting the Applicant and not the PM’s siblings, is the antecedent question of how Art 12(1) operates in relation to prosecutorial discretion, and what the relevant principles are. In other words, it is not possible to determine the fact of whether the PP has breached Art 12(1), without first understanding the law on Art 12(1). If this inherent legal question was what the Applicant had intended to refer, the Applicant should have phrased the Revised Question in more generic terms. In any case, as will be seen below, this inherent legal question also has to be dismissed, as it is settled law and does not raise any novel questions (see [40] above).<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even assuming, as explained above, that the Revised Question raises an antecedent inherent legal question concerning the interpretation and effect of Art 12(1) in relation to prosecutorial discretion, this has been settled by the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>([10] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The principles established in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>are explained here for ease of reference. In <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>, the Appellant argued that the Prosecution’s decision to charge him with the full amount of drugs, whilst charging a related accused person with a reduced amount of drugs, was in violation of Art 12(1) and unconstitutional. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>embarked on a detailed and comprehensive consideration of the law pertaining to the constitutional ambits of prosecutorial discretion under Art 12(1).

It also considered the constitutional basis of prosecutorial power; its nature; the presumption of constitutionality; as well as the approach in other jurisdictions, including US (at [43] to [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 After the lengthy discussion, the Court of Appeal established that: all things being equal, like cases must be treated alike with respect to all offenders involved in the same criminal conduct (at [24], [51]); there must be no bias on the Prosecution’s part and irrelevant considerations must not be taken into account (at [51]); the Prosecution is entitled to take into account many factors in its exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and where the factors apply differently to different offenders, it may justify different treatment between them (at [24], [52]); the burden of proof lies on the offender to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>breach of prosecutorial discretion (at [70] to [72]); and if such <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>breach is proven, the Prosecution must justify its prosecutorial decision to the court (at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Whether the Applicant disputes <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Applicant accepts these established principles, taking great length in his written submissions to set out the legal principles pertaining to prosecutorial discretion under Art 12.

I also note the Respondent’s point that the Applicant had initially explicitly mentioned in the Original Question that <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>should be considered in the present case (at [8] and [25] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In any event, I find that the established legal principles in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>apply to the present case. The Applicant argues that the distinction between <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>and the Applicant’s case is that in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>, both accused were prosecuted, albeit with different charges, whereas in the Applicant’s case, only the Applicant was charged while the PM’s siblings were not prosecuted. This is a tenuous distinction. The crux of the issue in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>was the question of whether the Prosecution’s actions of treating two accused persons in the same criminal enterprise differently, was a breach of Art 12(1). The same principle is involved whether the Prosecution chooses not to charge someone, or chooses to prefer a different/ reduced charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 A similar distinction was attempted but rejected in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>. This argument was in fact made by the present Applicant’s counsel, who was the accused’s counsel in that case. There, he argued that the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>should be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([54] above) because in <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>, the accused persons were charged with the same offence, but merely with different quantities of drugs, whereas in <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span>, the accused persons were charged with different offences. The court dismissed this distinction, finding that all these cases similarly concerned the Prosecution charging two offenders involved in the same criminal acts with offences of unequal gravity (at [64]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having regard to these matters, we are unable to accept the Applicant’s alternative argument that <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span> should be distinguished on the basis that while the co-offenders in that case were charged with different offences (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, abetment of drug trafficking and drug trafficking), in the present case, they were both charged with drug trafficking, but with the charges against one offender (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Sundar) based on a quantity of drugs much less than the actual quantity of drugs trafficked (as forensically determined)… In our view, there is no meaningful distinction between the scenario in <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span> and that in the present case as the underlying prosecutorial decision in each case was the same. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span>, Katheraven was, like Sundar in this case, charged with offences based on a quantity of drugs less than the actual quantity of drugs trafficked. In substance, <span class="font-italic">Thiruselvam</span> and the present case (and, for that matter, <span class="font-italic">Sim Min Teck</span> ([18] supra)) are all concerned with the Prosecution charging two offenders involved in the same criminal acts with offences of unequal gravity. Article 12(1) would apply to all of these cases in exactly the same way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Nevertheless, even accepting the Applicant’s argument that <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>can be distinguished from the present case, and that the principles there would not be strictly binding in the Applicant’s case, no novel question of law is raised. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Johari bin Kanadi and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 422 (“<span class="font-italic">Johari</span>”) at [9] and cited in <span class="font-italic">Chee Soon Juan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([14] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32], it is not sufficient to set out a new factual situation as new fact permutations will always arise, and in such cases the settled principles can just be applied or extrapolated ([40] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To merit a reference under s 56A, the applicant must show that there are new and difficult legal issues involving the Constitution which have not been previously dealt with by the superior courts. It is not sufficient merely to set out a new factual situation because new factual permutations will always arise. Where questions of law have already been decided or principles relating to an article in the Constitution have been set out by the superior courts, a subordinate court need not stay proceedings under s 56A but should proceed to apply the relevant case law or extrapolate from the principles enunciated to reach a proper conclusion on the facts before it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Small differences in fact, such as the one in the present case as compared to <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>, do not raise a novel legal issue because the lower court is expected to either apply the law or extrapolate from it. The lower court does not operate only in a mechanical way in applying decided principles or rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In other words, a s 395 CPC application does not require that the principles laid out be strictly binding to the present case, but is only concerned whether sufficient guidance has been laid down in respect of the law. If there is sufficient guidance putting the issue beyond dispute or controversy such that there is no necessity for the matter to require the attention of a superior court in the midst of the first instance proceedings, the s 395 CPC application should not be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Further, as explained above at [54], <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam </span>had undertaken a comprehensive review of the authorities and policy before laying down the framework for prosecutorial discretion. The framework was meant to be broad ranging and not limited only to the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam; </span>it hence provides sufficient guidance for the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Applicant also argues that questions concerning the effect of the Constitution do not need to be novel, as such question would have to take into account the unique nexus between the effects of that provision to that set of facts (see [18] above). He does not cite any authority for this proposition and I do not accept this as it contradicts the findings in <span class="font-italic">Johari</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chee Soon Juan </span>([65] above) that issues raised by new factual permutations fall outside the reference mechanism in s 395 CPC and s 56A SCA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Whether application of established principles to the facts is a question of law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Applicant argues relying on <span class="font-italic">Gujarat</span> that inferences to be drawn from admitted or proved facts is a question of law, and hence the Revised Question should be characterised as a question of law (above at [15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Gujarat</span> had to deal with two issues: first, whether the respondents were entitled under an easement statute to an irrevocable licence, which depended on the satisfaction of various statutory provisions (at [19]); and secondly, whether the respondents could rely on an equitable doctrine instead to claim the licence (at [21]). The resolution of both questions required the court to determine what the proper inference to be drawn was, based on proved facts. For the first question, the court needed to decide whether the proved facts properly led to the inference that the respondent had executed works on the land while “acting upon the license”, such that an irrevocable licence should be granted (at [20]). For the second question, the court had to decide if the proved facts were sufficient to justify the inference that the appellant had by conduct implied a perpetual licence to the respondent. Importantly, the appellate court held that the proper legal effect of proved facts is a question of law (at [18]), and hence that they were not bound by the decision of the first instance court on the issues. The Privy Council then went on to answer both questions in the negative, allowing the appeal (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Gujarat </span>seems to go against the Court of Appeal authorities set out above at [44] to [46]. Under the rule set out in <span class="font-italic">Teo Chu Ha</span> (at [44] above), the two issues in <span class="font-italic">Gujarat </span>should have been characterised as questions of fact. As stated, the test is whether the question is phrased in generic terms or is only specific to the particular case. In <span class="font-italic">Gujarat</span>, the questions were not phrased in generic terms, but were only specific to the facts of that particular case. The issue of what specific inference of fact can be drawn from specific proved facts, is ultimately also a question of fact. It may be that the question of what inferences can be drawn from facts, phrased generically, could possibly be a question of law. However, this was not so in <span class="font-italic">Gujarat </span>as there was no dispute about the general principles relating to the drawing of inferences from proved facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In addition, <span class="font-italic">Gujarat </span>also contradicts the Court of Appeal authorities at [46] above, which established that the application of established principles of law to the specific facts of the case is a question of fact. In <span class="font-italic">Gujarat</span>, in relation to the first issue, there was some discussion about the law where the court discussed the definition of what it means for the putative licensee to be “acting upon the license”, which was a statutory requirement to grant an irrevocable licence (at [20]). This was correctly characterised as a question of law since it was a general question and not tied to the facts of that case. However, after reaching a conclusion as to the meaning of this requirement, its application to the facts was a question of fact. There was no question of law pertaining to the second issue, since the court found that the grounds were decided in earlier authorities (at [21]), and the question was only one of application, which should be characterised as factual.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Hence, <span class="font-italic">Gujarat </span>seems to contradict the Court of Appeal authorities stated above, and to the extent they are contradictory, I do not follow it, as it is less persuasive as a foreign case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For completeness, I note that the Respondent relies on <span class="font-italic">Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Boon Winston v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] SGCA 67 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Siew Boon</span>”) to argue that every application of an objective test in a specific context is not a question of law.

The established rule was that the Defence had to show reasonable grounds for the court to believe that the Prosecution has in its possession material which should be disclosed (at [10]). The Applicant in that case raised the reference question of how this established test should apply in the context of sexual offences (at [13]). The Court of Appeal held at [13] that:

In our judgment, every test that rests on objective criteria, such as the existence of reasonable grounds, will necessarily be contextual in its application. In other words, what is reasonable will necessarily depend on the context. There is no need, therefore, to add to the “reasonable grounds” formulation in the specific context of sexual offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Contrary to the Respondent’s interpretation, the court did not state that the reference question was not a question of law.
