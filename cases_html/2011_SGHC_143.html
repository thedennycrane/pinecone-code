<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The main issues under consideration in this
                    decision are (i) the right of a party having the control of a derivative action
                    filed on behalf of a company to the documents of the company, and (ii) the duty
                    of the parties who have possession and control over the documents to give the
                    party in control of the action access to the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The company in question is Hiap Seng &amp; Co
                    Pte Ltd (“the company”) a family-run company. It was established
                    by the family patriarch, and subsequently, the running of the company devolved
                    to members of the two following generations. Disharmony and disagreement arose
                    over the running of the company, which led to litigation. The first set of
                    litigation was Originating Summons No. 372 of 2008, an application under
                    s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) by Law Chin Eng and Lau
                    Chin Whatt (the “first plaintiff” and “second
                    plaintiff” respectively, collectively “the plaintiffs”),
                    who are shareholders and directors of the company, but are not involved in its
                    day-to-day running, to bring an action in the name of the company against three
                    directors of the company, namely Lau Chin Hu, Lew Kiat Beng and Law Chin Chai
                    (the “first defendant”, “second defendant” and
                    “third defendant” respectively, collectively “the
                    defendants”) for breaches of their directors’ duties to the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The application was strenuously opposed by the
                    defendants. The first and third defendants were represented by one firm of
                    solicitors and the second defendant was represented by another. After hearing
                    counsel, I allowed the application on 30 September 2009 (see <em>Law Chin Eng and another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd</em>,
                    [2009] SGHC 223). However, I did not grant the plaintiffs <em>carte blanche</em> authority to sue in the name of the
                    company. I went through the plaintiffs’ complaints against the defendants,
                    and I granted the plaintiffs leave to bring an action in the name of and on
                    behalf of the company for breaches of their directors’ duties in five out
                    of the list of complaints put up by the plaintiffs and to facilitate the
                    exercise of the power, I ordered that the plaintiffs are to have control of the
                    action. The defendants appealed against the order, but the second
                    defendant’s appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and the first and
                    third defendants withdrew their appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       With the disposal of the appeals, the present
                    derivative suit was filed against the defendants, but progress in the action was
                    slow. There was persistent non-operation on the part of the defendants, and
                    eventually the company filed a summons (SUM No. 4129 of 2010) for orders
                    that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The application was made on the grounds
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the defendants refused to allow the plaintiffs to
                            enter into the company’s office premises in order that they may
                            fulfill the company’s discovery obligations; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiffs, as directors of the company, were
                            entitled under section 199(3) of the Companies Act to inspect the
                            accounting and other records which explain the transactions and
                            financial position of the company.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In his affidavit filed in support of the
                    application, the first plaintiff deposed that an order had been made in the
                    course of pre-trial hearings in the present action for the parties to file and
                    serve their respective lists of documents and affidavits verifying the lists.
                    The first plaintiff deposed that as he and the second plaintiff were granted
                    leave to bring the action in the name of the company, they had to ensure that
                    the company compiled a list of the documents in the possession, custody and
                    power of the company in relation to the action, and to verify the list by
                    affidavit. For that purpose, the company needed to have access to the
                    company’s documents, but the efforts to inspect the documents in the
                    company’s office premises were thwarted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendants opposed the application. They
                    made their arguments before the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) and
                    maintained the same arguments before me. The main arguments of the first
                    defendant and third defendant were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiffs did not “step into the
                            shoes” of the company when they obtained leave to bring the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The arguments for the second defendant
                    were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application was procedurally flawed. An
                            application made under s 199(3) should be made by way of an
                            originating summons by the plaintiffs as directors of the company, and
                            not by the company;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application, which appeared to the second
                            defendant to be for specific discovery, was flawed because there could
                            not be an application for specific discovery before general discovery
                            was completed;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                        and</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The AR dismissed the plaintiffs’
                    application on the ground that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the leave to commence the derivative action in
                            the name of the company did not enable the plaintiffs to “step
                            into the shoes” of the company;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application was procedurally flawed;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application was oppressive.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The application and the parties’
                    positions on the plaintiffs’ right of access to the documents have to be
                    considered against the plaintiffs’ and the defendants’ rights and
                    obligations under the Order of Court of 30 September 2009. The order gave
                    leave to the plaintiffs to bring an action in the name of and on behalf of the
                    company against the defendants for breaches of their directors’ duties to
                    the company, and the plaintiffs were put in control over the conduct of the
                    action. When the plaintiffs caused the action to be filed in exercise of those
                    powers, they were not suing in their capacities as shareholders or directors of
                    the plaintiffs. As shareholders or directors they did not have the <em>locus standi</em> to sue the defendants for breaches of their
                    directors’ duties as those duties were owed to the company, and not the
                    shareholders or directors. (By the same analysis, the plaintiffs’ reliance
                    on s 199(3) was misplaced as they were not seeking access to the documents
                    for themselves <em>qua</em> directors.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Having been granted leave to institute the
                    derivative action and to have control thereof, the plaintiffs have a duty to
                    exercise the power responsibly and reasonably in the interests of the company
                    and ensure that the action is to be prosecuted properly and diligently. Towards
                    that end, it is necessary for the plaintiffs to review all the documents
                    relevant to the action so that the best case can be pleaded and presented on
                    behalf of the company. The duty is not confined to reviewing documents in their
                    possession, and extends to the company’s documents which are not in their
                    possession. They would be in dereliction of their duty if they neglected to have
                    access to such documents and to review them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Conversely, the defendants must recognise the
                    plaintiffs’ right to pursue the action on behalf of the company. If there
                    are such documents in their possession and control as directors of the company,
                    then the defendants must allow the plaintiffs to have access to the documents.
                    The defendants have had their say on the plaintiffs’ entitlement to
                    prosecute the action on behalf of the company. Having raised their objections
                    and failed, they must acknowledge the plaintiffs’ status and rights. They
                    cannot withhold the relevant documents of the company from the plaintiffs who
                    have the control of the case on behalf of the company, and their refusal to give
                    access was, <em>prima facie</em>, a breach of their
                    directors’ duties to act in the interests of the company, and that
                    includes giving assistance to the company to prosecute the action effectively,
                    and not to hinder its efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is important to bear in mind that the
                    application under consideration is not the usual application for discovery and
                    inspection under O 24, Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed). This
                    application is made in the context of the leave to institute the derivative
                    action. The right of access to the relevant documents of the company flows from
                    the authority to institute the action, and it is not to be confused with the
                    right of discovery between adversial parties in an action or the right of a
                    company director to the records of a company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Counsel for the first and third defendants
                    argued that the plaintiffs did not, as he put it, “step into the shoes of
                    the company”, but that did not add anything to the examination and
                    understanding of the application. Counsel did not make clear what he intended by
                    “step into the shoes” of the company. While it is clear that the
                    Order of Court did not put the plaintiffs in control of the operations of the
                    company; the Order did put the plaintiffs in control of the action on behalf of
                    the company, and thereby to seek access to the documents on behalf of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The AR had more to say about stepping into the
                    shoes of the company. She noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[It cannot be that in all derivative actions where there is usually
                        acrimony between those who have been granted leave of court to bring suit
                        and those who are in actual control of the company, those who bring suit
                        step into the shoes of the company in the sense that their discovery
                        obligation extends to producing <em>all</em> the
                        documents in the [possession, custody and power] of the company which they
                        do not have control of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The observation is not quite apt and it did not take the issue any
                    further because the application was not for the discovery of <em>all</em> the documents, and was limited to the company’s
                    documents which related to the derivative action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Counsel and the AR had overlooked the fact
                    that the application was the company’s application, not the
                    plaintiffs’ application. The plaintiffs were named in the application as
                    the persons to be given access to the documents as representatives of the
                    company. For this reason, the fact that the plaintiffs did not “step into
                    the shoes” of the company cannot be a ground for refusing the
                    company’s request for access to the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the defendants’ complaint that the
                    application was procedurally flawed, the AR noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s submitted by [counsel], this method of applying for inspection by way
                        of SUM in the derivative action at the stage of general discovery is
                        procedurally flawed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and she appeared to agree with the argument that the application
                    should be made by way of an originating summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As I have explained, the application was made
                    by the company pursuant to the Order of Court of 30 September 2009. The
                    right of access asserted is a right arising out of the right to institute the
                    action, and is distinct from the right of discovery between adversial parties in
                    an action, or the right of company directors to the company records. When the
                    derivative action has been instituted in the name of the company, it was
                    procedurally regular and unexceptional that the application be made by a summons
                    as part of the ongoing action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In her decision to dismiss the application,
                    the AR also agreed with the defendants’ argument that the application was
                    oppressive. She stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I take the view that granting this application would be oppressive to the
                        Defendants. If the Plaintiff takes the view that certain documents have not
                        been produced after the completion of the general discovery process, it can
                        avail itself of the specific discovery process in order to ensure that all
                        relevant documents are before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Oppressiveness in discovery applications
                    usually relates to matters such as the scope of discovery or the time for
                    compliance, but the AR was not referring to that as her reference to general
                    discovery and specific discovery points to the form of the application, rather
                    than its content. I have dealt with the issue of form in the preceding
                    paragraph, and as for the content of the application, an application confined to
                    documents related to the derivative action cannot be oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The AR did not address the second
                    defendant’s submission that some of the documents are not in the
                    possession of the company. She may have considered that this was not a material
                    issue, and if she did, she was right. The application did not refer to specific
                    documents, but to documents in the company’s possession. The
                    defendants’ obligation when the application is granted is to give access
                    to such documents that are in the company’s possession; even if some
                    relevant documents are not in the company’s possession, the obligation
                    extends over those documents which are in the company’s possession. (Which
                    documents are relevant, and whether they are in the possession of the company,
                    may bring on further disputes if the state of non-cooperation
                continues.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having examined the issues and reviewed the
                    AR’s decision, I allowed the appeal and ordered the defendants to give
                    access to such documents that are in their possession, control and
                power.</p>
