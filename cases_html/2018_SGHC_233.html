SPH was the ultimate holding company for multiple subsidiaries and affiliate companies. I will refer to this group of companies collectively as “the Suntech Power group”. The Defendant, a company incorporated in Singapore, was previously also part of the Suntech Power group. The Defendant operates as an investment holding company engaged in equity investments. Between 8 October 2007 (the date of the Defendant’s incorporation) and 15 May 2013, it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Plaintiff.

</div> As for the claim for the unpaid share consideration of US$55,560,000, it may be seen from [71] to [77] of Jong’s AEIC that this represented – according to the Liquidators – one of two equity transfer transactions where the consideration for the transfer of shares from the Plaintiff to the Defendant was outstanding from the latter. The summary of all the loan transactions and equity transfer transactions identified by the Liquidators for the period 2007 to 2011 may be seen in the table at [87] of Jong’s AEIC, which shows them as totalling US$288,602,584.12. According to Jong, in bringing the present suit, the Liquidators had elected for various reasons to pursue claims only in respect of the above three loans and the unpaid share consideration of US$55,560,000. As will be seen, this became something the Defendant sought to take issue with during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the course of the trial, the Plaintiff called two factual witnesses – Jong and also an auditor Seah Gek Choo from Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP of Singapore (“Deloitte”) (previously the Defendant’s statutory auditors) – as well as one expert witness who testified on various aspects of PRC law relating to the construction of the Equity Transfer Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In the lead-up to the trial, the Defendant had informed that in addition to calling its own PRC law expert (“Sun”), it also intended to call a factual witness. This was one He Yue, who was stated to be an officer of Shanghai Suntech and whom the Defendant said had conducted an investigation into the transactions in issue in the Plaintiff’s claims. An AEIC was filed on behalf of He Yue in which – <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> – allegations of fraud were made about the underlying treatment of those transactions. However, the Defendant did not at any point apply to amend its pleadings to include these allegations of fraud. In any event, after the Plaintiff had closed its case, the Defendant disclosed that it had decided not to call He Yue. In the circumstances, He Yue’s AEIC was not admitted as evidence in the trial. The Defendant did not call any other witness apart from its PRC law expert.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the key evidence relied on by the Plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In bringing this action, the Liquidators of the Plaintiff relied primarily on accounting and financial documents.

</div> This accounting team was split into two when Wuxi Suntech was placed in bankruptcy administration, such that there came to be two accounting teams – one based in Wuxi Suntech and one in SPH. According to Jong, it was after Wuxi Suntech came under bankruptcy administration that the Liquidators encountered difficulties in obtaining financial documents from its accounting team. The Liquidators were permitted by the Wuxi administrator to download soft copies of such documents or to take photocopies, but were not able to obtain the originals of any of these documents.

It can hardly be unusual for the liquidator in the winding-up of a company to have no personal knowledge of the transactions in which the company was involved during its lifetime, and to rely on his investigation of the company’s financial records to form a view about the company’s assets as well as potential claims to be pursued on its behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As to the Defendant’s submission that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Plaintiff for not calling as witnesses Dr Shi and/or other former members of the Plaintiff’s senior management, I was satisfied that that there was no reason to draw such an inference in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Court of Appeal has made it clear that there “is no fixed and immutable rule of law for drawing such inference”: “[w]hether or not in each case an adverse inference should be drawn depends on all the evidence adduced and the circumstances of the case” (see <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 (“<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment</span>”) at [50]).

In the scheme of our adversarial litigation procedures, it is perfectly permissible for a party not to call witnesses or adduce evidence on any material point in issue. Section 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) mirrors the common law approach that a party cannot take issue with the raising of inferences about matters that the party has chosen to consciously conceal or hold back. The inference must, it has to be emphasised, be reasonably drawn from the matrix of established facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Rajah JC also held, following the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wisniewski v Central Manchester Health Authority</span> [1985] 5 PIQR P324, that whilst the drawing of an adverse inference may “go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness”, there must first have been “some evidence, however weak, adduced by the former on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired inference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue” (at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus in <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment</span>, for example, the trial judge found that as the plaintiffs had failed to make out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on any of its claims and that their main witness was unreliable and unworthy of belief, it was unnecessary to draw any adverse inference against the defendant for not calling certain witnesses whom the plaintiffs contended were material to the defence. It should be noted that the trial judge in <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment</span> also found that in any event, the defendant’s main witness had been involved in various key events from which the dispute between the parties arose, and there was nothing to show that he was not a material or relevant witness to the proceedings. The trial judge’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal (at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Fah</span>, on the other hand, the plaintiff having established that there was an accident in which the defendant’s motorcycle collided with the deceased (the plaintiff’s husband) on a straight road with light traffic, Rajah JC found that the defendant’s decision not to appear at the trial – in the absence of any legitimate reason for absence – warranted an adverse inference being drawn against him. As Rajah JC noted (at [44]): “a common sense approach should prevail. A person who has nothing to conceal would usually want to cooperate in such enquiries and vindicate himself. The defendant was not just a material witness; he was the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> witness to what transpired” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In similar vein, in <span class="font-italic">Chapman v Co</span><span class="font-italic">peland</span> (1966) 110 SJ 569 (cited by Rajah JC in <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Fah</span> at [40]), a case of a fatal road accident where the plaintiff widow relied on evidence of brake and tyre marks, the defendant driver’s decision not to give evidence was held to warrant an adverse inference being drawn. The court in that case explained that whilst there was no obligation on the defendant to give evidence at the end of the plaintiff’s case, given the circumstances in that case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">if he chose not to do so, he could not complain if, on a very narrow balance of probability, the evidence justified the court in drawing the inference of negligence against him … [W]here the defendant, quite legitimately, in a case in which there was nothing but accident mathematics, chose not to give evidence to the contrary, he could not complain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART &amp; another</span> [2015] SGHC 78 (“<span class="font-italic">ARS v ART</span>”), a key aspect of the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant related to two oral agreements which the plaintiff alleged parties had entered into. The first defendant denied the existence of the two oral agreements. It called as a factual witness a sales manager (Zachary) who had been actively involved in the dealings relating to the alleged oral agreements, and who gave evidence denying or doubting the existence of the oral agreements. The only witness for the plaintiff was Saul, its major shareholder and director. The trial judge found it noteworthy that the Plaintiff had not called either Saul’s son-in-law (Abel), or a former employee at its Singapore office (Tobias), both of whom appeared to have been extensively involved in the dealings relating to the alleged oral agreements. The learned judge found that the documentary evidence available to show that these alleged agreements had been validly concluded was “limited”, and that the evidence of both men – especially Abel – would have been material to the issue of whether the two oral agreements existed. He also held that Saul could certainly have arranged for both men to testify, given that Abel was his son-in-law and that he (Saul) was still in touch with Tobias (at [138]). There was no evidence that the two men were unavailable. In addition, the learned judge found Saul to be evasive when asked why Tobias was not called as a witness. He held, therefore, that the circumstances of the case warranted an adverse inference being drawn against the Plaintiff for not calling Abel and Tobias.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the present case, two things need to be borne in mind from the start.

Considerable efforts would have been required to track down the exact whereabouts of the individuals concerned, to interview them, and then to cajole them into travelling to Singapore to testify. In this connection, it should also be noted that the Defendant itself admitted that the previous management of the Plaintiff – or at least Dr Shi – had at one stage left the company under something of a cloud: the Defendant’s closing submissions refer, for example, to Dr Shi having been “forced to leave the Suntech Group in 2012 amidst allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds”.

As noted earlier, Dr Shi and other former members of the Plaintiff’s senior management were out of jurisdiction; and considerable efforts would have had to be made to track them down, to interview them, and then to persuade them to voluntarily travel to Singapore to testify at the trial. I did not find it unreasonable for the Liquidators to have assessed the feasibility of doing so on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, taking into account the evidence they had in hand, and to have determined upon such analysis that they did not need the former directors’ evidence to pursue the present claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 From Jong’s testimony,

</div> it also emerged that SPH’s board of directors – which included Dr Shi – had remained in place at least up until late 2014. The board members – including Dr Shi – were provided with the reporting packages or management accounts which formed part of the evidence relied on by the Liquidators; they could have raised objections to the contents of these reporting packages if they had disagreed with those contents (but there is no evidence that they did); and they were apprised of and authorised the Liquidators’ proposal to commence the present suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I further noted that the Liquidators <span class="font-italic">did</span> in fact make several attempts to contact Dr Shi to procure evidence from him for use in these proceedings. Jong explained that these attempts had been made because their solicitors had informed them that the Defendant had “strongly pushed” the point as to whether Dr Shi would be called as a witness.

</div> In April 2015, for example, attempts were made by the Liquidators to get Dr Shi to affirm an affidavit to be used in the present proceedings, but whilst Dr Shi seems to have kept up a veneer of affability in his email responses, he clearly did not affirm the affidavit forwarded to him.

</div> Another approach to Dr Shi was made in November 2017, when Jong managed to have a brief telephone conversation with him. According to Jong, Dr Shi had told him during this telephone conversation that he (Dr Shi) had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Defendant’s audited financial statements.

</div> The Liquidators then followed up on this telephone call by emailing Dr Shi the draft of a short “Financial Statement Confirmation” to confirm that the contents of the Defendant’s financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 were true and correct.

</div> Again, Dr Shi did not sign this draft statement. The point, however, is that the Plaintiff did take action to procure evidence from Dr Shi – and it was rebuffed. Indeed, the Defendant conceded as much in its closing submissions.

The factual matrix in each of those cases made it reasonable for the trial court to expect one of the parties to call certain witnesses to confirm or to clarify a certain state of affairs – and to infer, in the absence of such witnesses, that the party concerned was deliberately concealing or withholding evidence potentially adverse to its case. In contrast, in the present case, I was of the view that the factual matrix did not justify such adverse inference being drawn against the Plaintiff for not calling Dr Shi and/or other former directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I would add that the Defendant’s description of Jong as a “self-serving” witness was baseless and mischievous. This attempt to cast doubt on Jong’s integrity and objectivity as a witness appeared to be premised on the contention that it was in Jong’s “interests, as professionals involved in the liquidation exercise, to maximise recovery for the Plaintiff”.

</div> These comments were baseless and mischievous because recovery <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the wound-up company’s debts is effected for the benefit of the general body of its creditors; and it was Jong’s duty as liquidator to maximise such recovery. I should not be surprised if he did take some professional pride in his work – but that is beside the point, since there was no evidence at all to suggest that his objectivity and credibility as a witness were tainted by some underlying agenda to advance his professional standing and/or career prospects. Indeed, I observed that Jong was forthright – even guileless – in his testimony he readily admitted, for example, the mistake he had made in approving the filing of a claim by SPH in the Chinese courts for US$13,690,234.84

Nevertheless, since the Defendant’s argument appeared to be that the dropping of some claims cast doubt on the credibility of the documentary evidence relied on for the present claims, I reviewed the testimony given by Jong in explaining the reasons for the dropping of certain claims, as well as the surrounding evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In his AEIC, Jong had already explained that when the statement of claim was filed on 14 January 2014, the Plaintiff had put in a claim for the total amount of US$263,910,599.28 – and not US$288,602,584.12 – because at the point of filing, it did not have available certain supporting documents. Jong’s AEIC also stated that the total amount was amended to US$197,501,785 in July 2014 because the Liquidators were concerned about preventing the Defendant from dissipating its assets in the PRC. The Liquidators found it necessary, therefore, to file proceedings against the Defendant in the PRC by pursuing part of the Plaintiff’s claim in the PRC courts “to support asset preservation action so as to stop the Defendant from dissipating its key assets in the PRC”.

The eventual decision to drop certain claims was also motivated by the consideration that claims that were not so “straightforward” might not be worth pursuing because of the costs which would have to be incurred to prove those claims and the consequent likelihood of “a prolonged hearing and trial”.

I accepted that a key reason was the need to bring part of the claim in the PRC so as to “support asset preservation action”. It will be remembered that in February 2014, Wuxi Suntech had transferred its entire equity interest in the Defendant for US$1 to a BVI company called Fast Fame; and that following this transfer, the Defendant had proceeded in March 2014 to divest itself of several wholly-owned subsidiaries (see [6] to [10] above). As to the cost-benefit analysis which Jong said had been applied by the Liquidators to the claims in Singapore, this too appeared to me to be eminently reasonable. As Jong pointed out, whilst the Liquidators had a duty to maximise recovery for the creditors, they also had to be responsible in evaluating the costs of pursuing claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the circumstances, I did not agree with the Defendant that the amendments to the Plaintiff’s total claim amount revealed some underlying “defect” in their documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Defendant also argued that if indeed the Plaintiff were owed in excess of US$288m (per the Liquidators’ letter of demand) or US$265,604,567.58, it was “baffling that the Plaintiff [was] only pursuing the 4 Alleged Fund Transfers against the Defendant”.

One of the main questions before Rajah J was whether certain transactions between the plaintiffs and the defendants in that case amounted to moneylending transactions – and if so, whether they contravened the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “MLA”). In considering this question, Rajah J found it necessary to determine the preliminary issue of whether the transactions amounted to lending or the loan of money in the first place. Noting at [23] that the MLA “does not assist in explicitly defining what constitutes lending or the loan of money”, the learned judge found assistance instead in the following extract from Clifford L Pannam, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Money Lenders in Australia and New Zealand </span>(The Law Book Company Limited, 1965):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A loan of money may be defined, in general terms, as a simple contract whereby one person (“the lender”) pays or agrees to pay a sum of money in consideration of a promise by another person (“the borrower”) to repay the money upon demand or at a fixed date. The promise of repayment may or may not be coupled with a promise to pay interest on the money so paid. The essence of the transaction is the promise of repayment. As Lowe J. put it in a judgment delivered on behalf of himself and Gavan Duffy and Martin JJ.: ‘‘Lend’ in its ordinary meaning in our view imports an obligation on the borrower to repay.’ Without that promise, for example, the old <span class="font-italic">indebitatus</span> count of money lent would not lay. <span class="font-italic">Repayment is the ingredient which links together the definitions of </span><span class="font-italic">‘loan’ to be found in the Oxford English Dictionary, the various legal dictionaries and the text books.

These “hallmarks”, according to the Defendant, included factors such as “evidence of any board resolution authorising the Plaintiff to dispense the alleged loans (or the Defendant to receive the alleged loans” and “guarantee and/or collaterals provided by the Defendant”. The Defendant also stressed the fact that the alleged loan transactions were not explicitly described as “loans” in the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s accounts.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>”) at [17]. That “he who asserts must prove” is a “trite” common law rule which finds statutory expression in ss 103 and 105 of our EA: see <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> at [17]; also <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 at [14]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I say that “broadly speaking” the legal burden of proof in a loan claim will fall on the claimant because this is not invariably the case in all such claims. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>, the pleadings in a case will determine the incidence of the legal burden of proof. In some cases, the legal burden of proof may fall upon the defendant or alleged borrower, if for example – instead of simply denying the alleged debt or the underlying transactions which it relates to – he admits the existence of the amounts claimed and seeks to avoid liability through the positive allegation of payment (that is, a “confession and avoidance” plea). For example, in <span class="font-italic">Young v Queensland Trustees Limited</span> [1956] 99 CLR 560, a case cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> (at [24]), the executor of the deceased’s will sought recovery from the defendant of a fixed sum of money comprising several loans made to the defendant by the deceased during her lifetime. The defendant admitted in his defence to these loans but stated that he had repaid each of the loans during the deceased’s lifetime. The first instance judge gave judgment for the executor, and on appeal, the defendant argued that the judge should have placed the burden on the executor to disprove the payments. The High Court of Australia rejected this argument, holding that “[t]he law was and is that, speaking generally, the defendant must allege and prove payment by way of discharge as a defence to an action for indebtedness in respect of an executed consideration” (at 569–570).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I pause here to note that in the present case, the parties are agreed that the Defendant has <span class="font-italic">not</span> pleaded a confession and avoidance: the Defendant has simply denied the alleged debts. The Plaintiff does not dispute that it bears the legal burden of proof in respect of its four loan claims. The Plaintiff also does not dispute that it bears the corresponding evidential burden of proof, which has been described as “the need of the party to adduce evidence to discharge his legal burden (or the need of the opposing party to adduce evidence to prevent the proving party from discharging his legal burden)”: <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> at [18]. However – and this seems to be something which (with respect) the Defendant has not appreciated – this evidential burden can and often does shift in the course of a trial. This was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [58] to [60] of its judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 … There are in fact two kinds of burden in relation to the adduction of evidence. The first, designated the legal burden of proof … describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists … The second … falls short of an obligation to prove that a particular fact exists. It is more accurately designated the evidential burden to produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some evidence, whether in propounding or rebutting, will mean a failure to engage the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep this question alive. As such, this burden can and will shift.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 The court’s decision in every case will depend on whether the party concerned has satisfied the particular burden and standard of proof imposed on him. Since the terms ‘proved’, ‘disproved’ and ‘not proved’ are statutory definitions contained in the [EA], the term ‘proof’, whenever it appears in the [EA] and unless the context otherwise suggests, means the burden to satisfy the court of the existence or non-existence of some fact, that is, the legal burden of proof: see ss 103 and 105 of the [EA]. However, this is not to say that the evidential burden, which is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise an issue for the consideration of the trier of fact, does not exist. It exists as the tactical onus to contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence that has been led; there is no distinction between such tactical onus and the evidential burden.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60 To contextualise the above principles, at the start of the plaintiff’s case, the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff. The legal burden of proof – a permanent and enduring burden – does not shift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The manner in which a claimant in a trial who starts out bearing both the legal and the evidential burdens of proof goes about discharging these burdens was also explained in an article by Denning J (as he then was) titled <span class="font-italic">Presumptions and Burdens</span> (1945) 61 LQR 379 (“<span class="font-italic">Presumptions and Burdens</span>”), which was cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd &amp; another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 427 at [37]. Denning J started by noting that where the law imposes on a party the legal burden of proof in respect of a certain fact or issue, that legal burden does not shift. He cited the examples (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) of cases where the issue was whether a defendant was negligent; or whether a ship was unseaworthy; or whether goods had been lost without the default of the bailee; or whether a will was the last will of a free and capable testator. Noting that the burden of proving such issue rested on the person putting forward the proposition, Denning J went on to explain the manner in which such a person would go about adducing such proof (at 379–380):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to discharge a legal burden, the person on whom it lies will often prove relevant facts or rely on presumptions from which he asks the Court to infer the fact in issue which he has to establish in order to succeed. In the instances I have taken he will prove … that the thing which caused the accident was under the control of the defendant; or that the ship was lost within a short time of sailing; or that the goods were stolen; or he will rely on the presumption that the testator was of testamentary capacity. Those relevant facts or circumstances are often said to raise a ‘presumption’ or make a ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>’ case, and so they do in the sense that from them the fact in issue may be inferred, but not in the sense that it <span class="font-italic">must</span> be inferred unless the contrary is proved. The Court will decline before the end of the case to rule whether the fact in issue should be inferred. It will leave it to the other party to take his own course. He may seek to repel the inference by argument, as by submitting that the facts proved only raise a suspicion as distinct from a legitimate inference; or by contradicting the evidence; or by giving evidence of other facts to explain why the fact in issue should not be inferred; or by raising suspicions which counter-balance the presumptions. As the case proceeds the evidence may first weigh in favour of the inference and then against it, thus producing a burden, sometimes apparent, sometimes real, which may shift from one party to the other as the case proceeds or may remain suspended between them. The party on whom it rests must call evidence or take the consequences which may not necessarily be adverse: for the place where the burden eventually comes to rest does not necessarily decide the issue: because at the end of the case the Court has to decide as a matter of fact whether the inference should be drawn or not. These presumptions and burdens are therefore <span class="font-italic">provisional</span> only. It is a mistake to raise these provisional presumptions into propositions having the force of law. They are recognised by the law but their force depends on ordinary good sense rather than on law. They are only guides to the Court in deciding whether to infer the fact in issue or not. [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 From the foregoing passages, it can be seen that there is an important distinction to be drawn between the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> and <span class="font-italic">evidential</span> burdens in each case. The former does not shift and stems from the trite proposition that he who asserts a fact must prove that fact. The latter may shift over the course of the proceedings and is simply an evidential aid to assist the court in deciding whether, in any given case, a fact can be inferred from the surrounding evidence and thus results in the legal burden of proof being discharged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The case of </span>Seldon v Davidson</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I have cited the above authorities and commentaries in some detail because they are useful in aiding our understanding of the judgments delivered in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>.  This was a case which the Plaintiff relied on for the proposition that once it proved the fact of payment of a sum of money in circumstances where a presumption of advancement did not arise, then the evidential burden of proving that the sum of money was not paid as a loan fell to the Defendant, who would have to adduce evidence to discharge this evidential burden. In <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>, the plaintiff sued the defendant – her former chauffer and handyman – for the return of a sum of money which she alleged she had lent him. The defendant admitted receipt of the money but claimed that it had been a gift; alternatively, that if the money was a loan, it was repayable only when he was able to do so. On the case being called on for hearing, the plaintiff submitted that it was for the defendant to begin, and the county court judge so ruled. The defendant obtained an adjournment to appeal that ruling to the Court of Appeal. When the appeal came before the Court of Appeal, the court expressed reservations about whether the ruling by the county court judge had been a “mere ruling in the course of the trial” which did not appear to fall within the rules providing for appeals to the Court of Appeal. Having noted their reservations, the court proceeded nevertheless to hold that it was not prepared to say the county court judge had given a wrong ruling. The appeal was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the trial before me, the Plaintiff relied in the main on the following passage from the judgment of Willmer LJ in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> (at 1088B–G)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Payment of the money having been admitted, </span>prima facie<span class="font-italic"> that payment imported an obligation to repay in the absence of any circumstances tending to show anything in the nature of a presumption of advancement.</span> This is not a case of father and child, or husband and wife, or any other such blood relationship which could have given rise to a presumption of advancement …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Referring to the case of <span class="font-italic">Cary</span><span class="font-italic"> and others, executors of Greatorex v Gerrish</span> (1801) 4 Esp. 9 which was cited to the court] That is a case which no doubt bears a certain similarity to the present case, but it is, I think, distinguishable on grounds which appear from the judgment of Lord Kenyon. When this question was discussed before him, he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘No evidence is offered of the circumstances under which the draft was given; it might be in payment of a debt due by the testator: or the defendant might have given cash for it at the time.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No such considerations arise in the present case; indeed they are clearly ruled out, because we have from the defendant in this case a clear admission of the payment of the money, and no suggestion that it was paid in settlement of an existing debt, or that it was given in return for cash, or anything of that sort. In the absence of any such circumstances, money paid by the plaintiff in circumstances such as these is prima facie repayable on demand. If the defendant seeks to evade repayment of the money which was paid to him, it seems to me that the judge was right in placing the onus upon him to prove the facts which he alleges show that the money was not repayable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Plaintiff also relied on the judgment by Edmund Davies LJ who had agreed with Willmer LJ that “proof of payment imports a prima facie obligation to repay the advancement in the absence of circumstances from which presumption of advancement can or may arise”. The learned judge added that while Willmer LJ had expressed the view that such a loan would be repayable on demand, he took the view that “if not repayable on demand, [it was] at least repayable within a reasonable time of a request for repayment” (at 1090F–G).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It should also be noted that whilst the county court judge in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was reported as having ruled that the defendant bore the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden of proving one or other of his defences (at 1084F–G), neither Willmer LJ’s nor Edmund Davies LJ’s judgment made any reference to the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden of proof being imposed on the defendant instead of the plaintiff. Rather, their view appeared to be that the defendant having admitted receipt of the money and it being clear that no presumption of advancement arose on the facts, the trial should proceed on the basis that it was for the defendant to call evidence of his assertion that he had received the money as a gift. Whilst Willmer LJ referred in his judgment to the “onus” being on the defendant to show that the money was not repayable, it does not appear to me that he believed somehow that the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden of proof had shifted to the defendant: in the same passage, he made it clear that the inference that the money was repayable was only a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>” inference (see <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> at 1088F–G). To paraphrase the words of Denning J in <span class="font-italic">Presumptions and Burdens</span>, Willmer LJ appeared to be doing no more than pointing out that the evidence of payment and the absence of circumstances justifying a presumption of advance were enough to “make a ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>’ case … in the sense that from them the fact in issue [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the obligation to repay] <span class="font-italic">may</span> be inferred, but not in the sense that it <span class="font-italic">must</span> be inferred unless the contrary is proved” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Read in context, therefore, the proposition that proof of payment in the absence of circumstances giving rise to a presumption of advancement “imports a prima facie obligation to repay” the money paid really amounted to a presumption of fact; namely, that a fact in issue in the loan claim – the obligation to repay – “may be inferred, but not in the sense that it must be inferred unless the contrary is proved”. Just like other presumptions (such as the presumption of advancement), such a presumption is an evidential instrument which operates where there is no direct evidence that may reveal the intention of the parties: see for example <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [59]. As Denning J noted in his article, these factual presumptions are not inevitable in every case. These points were made by the New Zealand High Court in <span class="font-italic">Zheng </span><span class="font-italic">and Yu and anor v Qiu and Yu</span> [2007] NZHC 1827

A factual presumption is to be distinguished from a presumption of law (which may be rebuttable or irrebuttable) depending upon its nature and legal characterisation. The basic difference between presumptions of fact and law is the source from which they are derived. Presumptions of law are derived from the law (for example from statute) whereas presumptions of fact are derived from logic and common sense …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[46] With respect to factual presumptions, both the judgments of Willmer and Edmund Davies LJJ in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> make it clear that it is not in every case that the factual presumption (which they found could apply from a payment of money) would be held to apply. In fact, the circumstances in the 19th century cases of <span class="font-italic">Cary</span> and <span class="font-italic">Welch</span> were examples in which the presumption did not apply. The principle that the English Court of Appeal was endorsing in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was that the presumption might not apply in circumstances where the payment was made in settlement of an existing debt, or was given in return for cash or something of that nature. Such an approach is consistent with the notion that, in the case of factual presumptions, the Court may or may not decide to apply them depending upon the particular circumstances of the case: see <span class="font-italic">Cross &amp; Tapper on Evidence</span> (9ed 1999) at 113-114.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In the context of a claimant such as the present Plaintiff who must prove first that he paid the defendant money and secondly that there is an obligation on the defendant’s part to repay the money, <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> enables him to submit to the court that once he proves payment in the absence of circumstances justifying a presumption of advancement, a presumption arises of the obligation to repay. Assuming this factual presumption applies, the evidential burden then shifts to the defendant who must either call evidence to prevent the claimant from discharging his legal burden of proof or take the consequences. If the Defendant is able to discharge this evidential burden, the evidential burden of proof shifts back to the Plaintiff to satisfy the court that the money is repayable.

</div> With respect, this submission was premised on a failure to appreciate the distinction between legal and evidential burdens of proof and/or the nature of the presumption which the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was espousing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In a situation where there is no direct evidence available, the court - in assessing whether the plaintiff has adduced enough evidence to make out his case on a balance of probabilities – will need to draw inferences from the available indirect evidence.  Faced with a situation where one party advances money to another with no discernible explanation for the payment of money (such as a legal obligation to pay under a contract or a factual explanation that the money was a gift to a family member), the natural inference that the court is entitled to draw is that the sum of money was advanced as a loan which would be repaid. Indeed, this is how rational parties who deal at arm’s length typically behave – they do not give away money for no reason. Seen in this light, it is entirely explicable why it should fall to the defendant to raise plausible explanations for why the plaintiff may have advanced him the money once the plaintiff has established that (i) the money was advanced and (ii) on the face of it, there was no good reason why the money was advanced.  This also accords with Edmund Davis LJ’s statement that the ultimate question in principle is “what is <span class="font-italic">to be inferred</span> as to the nature of the transaction when the simple payment of money is proved or admitted between strangers” [emphasis added] (at 1090F–G).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Another argument raised by the Defendant in claiming <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was wrongly decided was the related point that the English Court of Appeal had wrongly treated the defence in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> as being one of a plea of confession and avoidance – and that this error had led it to impose the legal burden of proof on the defendant. For the reasons explained at [83] to [86] above, I rejected this argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Yet another argument raised by the Defendant related to its contention that the judges in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> had erroneously “relied on resulting trust analysis to justify the presumption that the monies paid were repayable on demand”.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Big Island</span>”) – at [91] to [98]. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, Mason NPJ had opined that “the imposition of a resulting trust was designed evidently [by the appellate court in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>] to justify an order for the repayment of the money paid on the footing that it was a loan” (at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 With respect, the above observation was not quite accurate. The decision reached by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did not in fact involve “the imposition of a resulting trust … to justify an order for the repayment of the money paid on the footing that it was a loan”. No such order was made. On the facts available, the Court of Appeal simply decided it was not wrong for the trial to proceed on the basis that it was for the defendant to call evidence of his assertion of a gift. There was no finding by the court that a resulting trust had arisen on the facts. Nor did it appear that the two judges who delivered judgments were unaware that the plaintiff “did not claim that there was a resulting trust” in the house purchased by the defendant (as Mason NPJ noted at [91]): both judges expressly referred to the plaintiff seeking recovery of the money she had paid the defendant (see for example <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> at 1087A–B and 1090B–C). Reading their judgments in context, it appeared to me that the references to a resulting trust of the house meant no more than this: if <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> had been a case where the plaintiff was laying claim to an interest in the house, then it being admitted that the purchase money came from her and that the circumstances did not justify a presumption of advancement, a presumption of resulting trust in the house would have arisen which the defendant would have had to call evidence to rebut. Instead of claiming an interest in the house, however, the plaintiff had claimed recovery of the money paid. In such circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that a court would have been ready to presume a resulting trust in the house had she claimed an interest in it, the court should be ready to presume that the payment of the money imported a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> obligation to repay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The above reasoning would explain Willmer LJ’s remark that this was “not a case of father and child, or husband and wife, or any other such blood relationship which could have given rise to a presumption of advancement”. Mr Sears (the defendant’s counsel) was (at 1088B–D, see also Edmund Davies LJ’s decision at 1089H–1090A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">constrained to admit that the house which had been bought with the aid of the money paid by the plaintiff was no doubt prima facie subject to a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff. <span class="font-italic">That being so, it would be strange indeed if the same considerations did not apply to the money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant to assist him in the purchase of the house</span> [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This would also explain why the English Court of Appeal has in a subsequent case stated that <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a “trust case” but that it was “none the less instructive”: <span class="font-italic">Patel v Mirza</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1046

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Patel v Mirza</span>”) at [90].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I would respectfully add that insofar as it was suggested in <span class="font-italic">Big Island</span> that “the proposition … that the payment of money <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> imported an obligation to repay” should be confined “so that it has no application at all to commercial transactions” (at [99]), I did not see any sound logical or policy reason to adopt such an approach. <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> has certainly been applied by other courts in cases involving commercial transactions. One example from English case law is <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> a company, ex parte Shooter; Re a company, ex parte Broadhurst and others (No 2)</span> [1991] BCLC 267 (“<span class="font-italic">Re a company</span>”).  In that case, Harman J was conducting an inquiry – in the context of minority oppression proceedings – into the status and quantum of payments made to a football club (the company) by one K (the chairman and controlling shareholder of the company) and a company called CIP which K controlled. In finding that certain amounts were due by the company to K and CIP, Harman J considered the decision in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> and held (at 283<span class="font-italic">g</span>–<span class="font-italic">i</span> and 284<span class="font-italic">a</span>–<span class="font-italic">b</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I accept that the law is as Edmund Davies LJ put it, ‘… when the simple payment of money is proved or admitted between strangers … proof of payment imparts a prima facie obligation to repay …’ It seems to me that ruling must apply with additional force to payments by a limited company established for trading purpose to another limited company …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">From that proposition it was submitted that unless there were clear evidence that a payment to a company was a gift, referred to in argument as a donation which is merely a longer word for the same thing, the mere fact that [K] was the chairman of the company and so perhaps likely to wish it well did not establish that his payments were gifts.

What is perhaps interesting, even telling, is that having examined <span class="font-italic">Big Island</span>, the Court of Appeal held at [27] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[w]hat <span class="font-italic">Big Island</span> demonstrates is that, if the Respondent in this case [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>] had simply run its defence on the basis that the debt disclosed by the three invoices did not exist, then the burden would have been squarely on the Appellant to prove that the debt did exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whilst Mason NPJ had in <span class="font-italic">Big Island</span> “described the creditor in such a situation as also carrying the burden of proving the debtor’s ‘failure to repay’”, the Court of Appeal clarified that it understood him as simply saying “that the creditor in these circumstances must prove that his claim is premised on a subsisting debt in order to make good his case”: the court did:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">not read this part of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Big Island</span> as suggesting that the creditor must conclusively show a lack of repayment on the part of the debtor for that would essentially place on him (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the creditor) the all too onerous burden of proving a negative</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> (<span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies </span>at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Following from the last observation, there would seem to be nothing in our case law to suggest our courts have rejected or would be inclined to reject <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Lee</span>”), the plaintiff and several other persons were shareholders in the defendant company. The defendant was the developer of a residential property. Each shareholder had contributed to the defendant’s paid-up capital and advanced loans to the defendant for the purchase of the land, development expenses and payment of interest on bank loans. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the recovery of the sums he had advanced to it, claiming that these were loans repayable on demand. The fact that the advances were loans was not disputed: the question before the court was whether there should be an implied term in respect of when the loans were repayable. Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) held that in order to give business efficacy to the property development project, and applying the test of necessity, there should be an implied term that the loans would be repaid only after all moneys due to the defendant had been received and all creditors had been paid their dues. Tay JC cited <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> as an authority for this proposition. It is pertinent to note that in so doing, he expressly acknowledged the principle stated in that case that “[i]n ordinary circumstances, payment of money imports a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> obligation to repay the money in the absence of circumstances from which a presumption of advancement can or may arise” (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Meng v Harjantho Johnny</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 738

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Meng</span>”), the appellant was a general manager in a company incorporated by the respondent and his wife. The appellant was entitled to a share of the company’s profits as part of his remuneration. Subsequently, when the appellant’s friends Koh and Neo invested in the company, the appellant was allotted 40,000 shares. The respondent sued the appellant for the repayment of a loan of S$40,000 allegedly provided to the appellant to pay for his shares. The appellant contended that he had given up his profit-sharing arrangement with the company on the basis that it would be replaced by the allotment of the 40,000 shares; and that he did not know whether the respondent and Koh had paid for those shares or whether Koh alone had paid for the shares. The district judge dismissed the respondent’s appeal but he appealed successfully to the High Court. The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed his appeal. The Court of Appeal noted that the district judge had accepted the appellant’s assertion about giving up his profit sharing arrangement with the company on the understanding that it was to be replaced by the allotment of 40,000 shares in the company; and that the district judge had also found that the appellant would not have accepted this arrangement if he had been required to pay for the shares. The Court of Appeal also noted that the appellant’s defence showed that he denied the existence of a loan and asserted that he was not required to pay for the shares. It followed that it was “open to the district judge to find that the appellant had not taken a loan from the respondent even though Koh had not paid for the shares” (<span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Meng </span>at [13]). In coming to this conclusion, the Court of Appeal held that this case was clearly distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> whilst clearly – if implicitly – accepting the principles stated in that case. The court explained as follows (at [15]–[16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 [In <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>], Willmer LJ explained … that his decision was premised on the fact that there had been a clear admission of the payment of the money, and ‘no suggestion that it was paid in settlement of an existing debt, or that it was given in return for cash, or anything of that sort’. In the absence of such circumstances, money paid by the plaintiff in circumstances such as these is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> repayable on demand. As such, if the defendant wanted to evade repayment of the money which was paid to him, the trial judge was right in placing the onus upon him to prove that the money was not repayable …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 Unlike the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span><span class="font-italic"> v Davidson</span>, the appellant in the present case denied that he had received any money from the respondent in the form of a loan. He has proven that he took the 40,000 shares in exchange for his right to a share of the company’s profits. Thus, although the respondent used his own money to pay for the appellant’s 40,000 shares, it did not follow that the money had been loaned by the respondent to the appellant to enable the appellant to purchase the 40,000 shares in question …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The fact that our appellate court took pains to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> on the facts clearly indicated its implicit acceptance of the correctness and validity of the decision in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The proposition highlighted above in Willmer LJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> has also been reproduced in <span class="font-italic">Specific Contracts</span> at para 6.2.13.

</div> in which the English Court of Appeal had to deal with a dispute between two co-habitants. One of them (Mr Chapman) had moved into the home of the other (Mrs Jaume) and had paid for building works on the home. Subsequently, their relationship ended, and Mr Chapman brought a claim for repayment of the payments made for the building works. The first instance judge rejected his claim. On appeal, his counsel cited <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> to the Court of Appeal; specifically, the passages from the judgments of Willmer and Edmund Davies LJJ reproduced above at [81]–[82]. The Court of Appeal remarked that it was unfortunate that the attention of the first instance judge had not been drawn to <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [23]). Noting that there was authority that no presumption of advancement existed between co-habitants, the Court of Appeal went on to apply the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> and concluded that “on the facts found by the judge, he ought to have drawn the inference that the money was repayable within a reasonable time after demand” (at [25]) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Having examined the English cases mentioned by the Defendant in its closing submissions, I rejected the Defendant’s statement that “none of the cases … had critically reviewed [<span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>]”.

Until such time as the UK Supreme Court might express a different view, the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> – that “proof of payment imports a prima facie obligation to repay the advancement in the absence of circumstances from which presumption of advancement can or may arise” – certainly represents the current position in English law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The second and final point I make regarding <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> concerns the line of Australian cases which the Defendant referred to (but did not elucidate) in which <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> was not followed.

</div>
</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Heydon</span>”). In this regard, it should be observed that <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span> was decided before <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>, and that the High Court’s judgment is a brief one. In <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span>, the plaintiff brought a claim – as the executor of the estate of one Bessie Albo de Bernales – for the recovery of a sum of £150 from the defendant on the basis that this sum had been a loan by the deceased, or alternatively, on the basis of money had and received. The defendant admitted receiving the deceased’s cheque for £150 but alleged that the money was a gift. On appeal, the High Court held (at 113) that the plaintiff bore “the burden of proving the facts in support of either one or other cause of action set out in the statement of claim”. Insofar as this appeared to be a reference to the legal burden of proof, and having regard to the views I expressed above (at [80]–[99]) on how <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> may be understood, I did not think the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span> was in any way contrary to the reasoning adopted in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>. Insofar as the evidential burden was concerned, it may be noted that the defendant had given evidence of her friendship with the deceased and of the deceased’s intention to make her a gift of the £150. The High Court recorded that the plaintiff conceded he had “no further evidence to offer now than he had then” (at 113), before going on to state that the “evidence thus given did not satisfy any of the Judges that in fact any case had been made out, or that the money had been lent, and it does not satisfy us either that any of the allegations made in the statement of claim are correct.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the circumstances, it appeared to me that all the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span> was saying was that the legal burden of proof did not shift from the plaintiff; and the defendant having given some evidence of her allegation about a gift to which the plaintiff had no further evidence in response, the evidential burden to give some explanation of the fact that she received the money would have been discharged. Since the plaintiff did not have any further evidence to contradict the defendant’s explanation, the legal burden, which had always remained on the plaintiff, was not discharged. Thus, insofar as the Australian cases that the Defendant cited had declined to follow <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> on the basis of <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span>, I would respectfully differ from the analysis in those cases.  For the reasons set out above, I was of the view that the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Heydon</span> only dealt with the issue of the legal burden, not the evidential burden; and to that extent it could be read consistently with <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I summarise the applicable legal principles as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) A loan is in essence a payment of money to or for someone on the condition that it will be repaid.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Accordingly, the Plaintiff must prove first that it paid the Defendant money; and secondly that there is an obligation on the Defendant’s part to repay the money.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The English authority of <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is applicable in Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> does not alter the general principles on legal burden of proof which are encapsulated in ss 103 to 105 of our EA. Instead, <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> enables the Plaintiff to submit that once he proves payment in the absence of circumstances justifying a presumption of advancement or any other plausible explanation as to why the sum of money was advanced, the court is entitled to infer that the sum of money was meant to be repaid and thus a presumption arises of the obligation to repay.  The question really is whether in each case there is something in the circumstances surrounding the payment of money that would disentitle the plaintiff from asking the court to infer that an obligation to repay can be inferred from the payment of money. It is a factual question to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Assuming the factual presumption applies, the evidential burden shifts to the Defendant. If the Defendant is able to discharge this evidential burden, the evidential burden of proof shifts back to the Plaintiff to satisfy the court that the money is repayable. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced by the Defendant, it may be concluded from the Plaintiff’s evidence that the legal burden is also discharged and a finding against the Defendant may be made on the issue of its obligation to repay.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Having set out the applicable legal principles, I turn now to explain how these principles applied to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Defendant s arguments in rebuttal of the Plaintiff’s case on the loan claims fell into two main categories. First, the Defendant focused on criticising the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff. The upshot of these criticisms appeared to be that the Plaintiff could not invoke the presumption of fact in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> because the Plaintiff could not rely on the evidence which showed that the transfers had been made. Second, the Defendant referred to some other documents which, in its submission, showed that the transfers of the sums of money were for reasons other than loans. This second set of arguments appeared to go towards the submission that even if the presumption of fact in <span class="font-italic">Seldon</span> applied and the evidential burden shifted to the Defendant, the burden was discharged. I address each of these categories of criticisms in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s criticism of the quality of the Plaintiff’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In its amended Defence the Defendant had put the Plaintiff to strict proof of the relevant transfers of monies on which the loan claims were premised. In its closing submissions, however, the Defendant conceded that “there is evidence of the Alleged Transfers”.

</div> Notwithstanding this concession, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff could not rely on its own accounts as evidence, nor could it rely on the Defendant’s accounts as evidence because the Defendant was an affiliate of the Plaintiff. The Defendant thus appeared to be arguing that although these accounts showed that the transfers had been made, the Plaintiff could not rely on either set of accounts and thus the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the transfers of money had been carried out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I rejected these submissions for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the Plaintiff could rely on its own accounts as evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108  First, the Defendant argued that s 34 of the EA precluded the Plaintiff from relying “exclusively” on its own accounts to establish the Defendant’s liability for the claimed loans. This proposition did not take the Defendant’s case very far, since the Plaintiff did not dispute it as a general statement of principle. Instead, the Plaintiff asserted that its case was supported not just by its own accounts but by other documentary evidence including the Defendant’s audited financial statements and documents relating to the Wuxi restructuring exercise.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Chandradhar</span>”), for example, where the respondents (a bank) sued the appellants for the recovery of monies allegedly advanced to them, one of the main questions raised in the High Court was whether a sum of Rs 10,000 was proved to have been advanced to the appellants on 19 March 1947. The appellants denied any such advance, and the main appellant – in whose name the bank account was – gave testimony. The respondents did not produce any evidence of it other than a copy of an entry in their account books which simply stated: “To amount paid to Gauhati branch as per D/advice, dated 6th March 1947”. The appellants disputed that the advance had been proved and cited s 34 of the Indian Evidence Act (which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with our s 34). In hearing the appellant’s appeal against the judgment given by the High Court, the Indian Supreme Court held that in light of the appellants’ pleadings and the main appellant’s testimony (at 1968):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the bank had to prove that the sum of Rs. 10,000 was in fact advanced on March 19, 1947, and could not rely on mere entries in the books of accounts for that purpose. This is clear from the provision in s. 34 of the Evidence Act … Section 34 says that such entry alone shall not be sufficient evidence, and so some independent evidence had to be given by the bank to show that this sum was advanced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The court noted that the bank had merely produced the single entry in the account books; and that the only witness called on behalf of the bank was an officer who had nothing to do with the branch where the transactions had been entered into. In the court’s view:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [i]f this amount of Rs. 10,000 was paid by the bank on the order of the appellants or any one of them that order should have been produced in support of the entry, and then the entry would have been helpful to the bank as a corroborative piece of evidence. But the bank did nothing of the kind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Having regard to s 34 of the EA, therefore, the appellants could not be charged with liability for the sum of Rs 10,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 From the above, it is clear that the evidence relied on by the respondents in <span class="font-italic">Chandradhar</span> was so sparse as to be non-existent. This was certainly not the position the present Plaintiff found itself in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Also clearly distinguishable on the facts was the Singapore case of <span class="font-italic">Re Ice-Mack Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 283 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Ice-Mack</span>”). In this case, the applicant company – AA Valibhoy &amp; Sons (1907) Pte Ltd – filed a proof of debt against Ice-Mack Pte Ltd (“the company”) which was in liquidation. The applicant and the company were associate companies as they were both managed by one Mr Mohd Yunus Valibhoy who was a director of both companies and held a “dominant position” in both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 On the applicant’s appeal against the liquidator’s rejection of its proof of debt for a sum of S$2,428,418.49, the High Court noted that the applicant had presented its case “in a series of bits and pieces”, and that its case “depended almost entirely on the acceptance of the evidence of its accountants and its own audited accounts, which it allowed to surface at need” (at [20]). In gist, the evidence offered by the applicant to substantiate its claims comprised – apart from its own audited accounts – pages extracted from its own ledgers, an isolated certificate from its own accountants, and an audit confirmation signed by Mr Valibhoy himself. Despite the liquidator repeatedly requesting documentary evidence of the alleged debt (such as “credit and debit notes, the vouchers and receipts, and other documentary evidence”), such evidence was not forthcoming (at [21]). The court also noted that in exhibiting extracts from its own audited accounts, the applicant had gotten itself into “an unenviable position” whereby it appeared that “as at 31 December 1982, just before it was wound up on 11 March 1983, the company did not owe any money to the applicant at all”; that in fact, the audited accounts as at end 1982 appeared to show Mr Valibhoy himself owing the applicant S$2,538,190.19; and that it appeared the applicant had then found it “necessary” to “reconstruct its claim against the company” (at [9]). This it sought to do by producing the certificate from its accounts which purported to “confirm” that a sum of S$2,428,418.49 owing from the company to the applicant had been “transferred to the account of [Mr Valibhoy]”; and it was then alleged by Mr Valibhoy that he had agreed with the applicant that despite the “transfer” of the S$2,428,418.49 debt to him, the applicant would claim the said sum from the liquidator and account to him for the same (at [8]–[9]).

</div>
</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Popular Industries</span>”), the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had failed to deliver goods allegedly contracted for and that they were entitled to loss of profit resulting from the non-delivery. The plaintiff sought to prove the alleged loss of profit by relying on the oral testimony of their auditor and a sheet of calculations he produced. It was not disputed that the auditor’s testimony and his sheet of calculations were based on the plaintiff’s account books – but strangely, these accounts were never produced in evidence. Edgar Joseph Jr J found this a “glaring omission” and held the auditor’s oral evidence as well as the sheet of calculations inadmissible as a result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In the present case, the Defendant has cited Edgar Joseph Jr J’s further remarks to the effect that even had the plaintiffs’ accounts been produced in evidence, they:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… could not by themselves have been sufficient to charge the defendants with liability having regard to the provisions of s 34 of the Evidence Act so that the entries themselves would have had to be proved by someone having personal knowledge of the transactions reflected in such entries. The accountant and auditor Mr So, despite what he might say, was not such a person as he, like any accountant, would of necessity have to rely upon information derived from documentary sources and explanations provided by his clients when preparing the accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 It would be neither appropriate nor helpful, however, merely to refer to these remarks in isolation from the facts of <span class="font-italic">Popular Industries</span>. The auditor (Mr So) in <span class="font-italic">Popular Industries</span> was the sole witness giving evidence to prove the plaintiffs’ claim for loss of profits. In so doing, he purported to testify as to the plaintiffs’ sales performance, overhead expenses and profit margins over a five-year period. These were transactions which the defendants had no part in and were not privy to. Indeed, Mr So admitted that all his figures were simply derived from the plaintiffs’ own account books and were not corroborated by any other evidence before the court. In those circumstances, it was hardly surprising that Edgar Joseph Jr J should have rejected his assertion that “the plaintiffs would have realized the profits shown” in his sheet of calculations had they received the contracted goods. As the learned judge put it (quoting Wadegaonkar J in <span class="font-italic">Beni</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bisan Dayal &amp; Anor</span> AIR (1925) Nag 445):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[m]ere entries in books of account are not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability (vide s 34 of the Evidence Act). The reason is that a man cannot be allowed to make evidence for himself by what he chooses to write in his own books behind the back of third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In contrast, in the present case the fund transfers for the claimed loans were not only evidenced by supporting documents such as credit and debit notes, instructions to banks and the like, and recorded in the Plaintiff’s own accounts as receivables due from the Defendant; they were also recorded in the Defendant’s accounts as liabilities owed to the Plaintiff. In addition, as seen from Jong’s evidence (summarised earlier at [24] to [32]), the purposes for which the Plaintiff said the fund transfers were made all related to payments which the Defendant had to make – payments relating to investment in a mining project, to enable a shareholder loan to an indirect subsidiary, to finance the purchase of shares – and these corresponding pay-outs were also recorded in the Defendant’s accounts.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>”) as authority for this proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122  First, insofar as the Defendant was suggesting that <span class="font-italic">SIC College</span> had established a general principle barring a corporate plaintiff from relying on the accounts of a related entity as evidence of a debt owing between them, this was clearly an inaccurate over-statement. In <span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>, the respondents – Ken Yeo, Koo and Chua – were three former employees of the appellant. The appellant sued the respondents claiming that they were parties to a scheme to enrich a company they had set up at the appellant’s expense. Nearly a year after the writ was first filed, Ken Yeo brought a counterclaim against the appellant allegedly arising from 18 advances made to the appellant on a running account basis. The appellant denied that there had been any such advances and instead alleged that Ken Yeo had used the accounting books to create fictitious entries. At the trial of the counterclaim, the key piece of evidence relied on by Ken Yeo was a print-out from the appellant’s system, which purported to list the alleged 18 transactions on a running account basis. The appellant challenged the evidence of the print-out. The trial judge eventually allowed Ken Yeo’s counterclaim after excluding several transactions. In allowing the appeal and ordering a retrial, the Court of Appeal made the following observations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 The Appellant contends that the <span class="font-italic">key </span>piece of evidence relied upon by the Judge was the Printout. The Printout had been extracted from the Appellant’s system and provided by Koo, but Koo was not called to give evidence, and the admissibility of this piece of evidence was challenged on the basis of hearsay. While the Printout was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> admissible under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act as a statement made in the course of trade, business, profession or other occupation, the court is nevertheless required to properly consider the discretion to exclude such evidence under s 32(3). This involves a balancing exercise involving weighing the significance of the evidence against its unreliability or other harm which might compromise fair adjudication (with the effect of being substantively unjust or procedural oppressive) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … [T]he Judge found that even though Ken Yeo was not the person who made the entries, he was the supplier of the information on the transactions, which were (partly) substantiated by bank statements … However, the Printout was relied on to <span class="font-italic">corroborate</span> or <span class="font-italic">prove</span> Ken Yeo’s assertions, which was that the moneys were transferred on a certain basis … One of the reasons why Koo should have been called in the first place is to examine the veracity of <span class="font-italic">facts found within</span> the Printout …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 While it was ultimately within the scope of the Judge’s discretion to admit the evidence, the admission of the Printout was not in itself sufficient, without other evidence, to prove a <span class="font-italic">debt</span> because s 34 of the Evidence Act states that such statements ‘shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability’. The obvious danger of relying on account book entries is even greater if the claimant or one of his affiliates was the one who was making the records. This danger remains even if accountants had given an unqualified opinion on the previous consolidated accounts that formed the basis for the first transaction on the ledger.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 It is plain from the above extract that the Court of Appeal did not lay down any general principle barring a corporate plaintiff from relying on the accounts of a related entity to show a debt owing between them. Instead, the court was concerned with highlighting the “obvious danger” of a claimant in a case relying on records that he himself – or someone affiliated to him – had made in order to prove his claim. This is practical good sense. Whether in any case the “danger” of allowing a claimant to adduce accounting entries he (or his “affiliate”) has made as evidence of his claim is so great as to render that evidence “unreliable” – or to “compromise fair adjudication” – is a question that can only be answered on a case-by-case basis. It should be noted that in the same passage in which it made these remarks, the Court of Appeal also stated that it was within the scope of the trial judge’s discretion to admit the evidence of the print-out. The court went on to hold that whilst there was “some merit” to the appellant’s arguments, “taking the evidence that was considered by the Judge in <span class="font-italic">isolation</span>” [emphasis in original], it was “unable to say that Ken Yeo ha[d] failed to discharge his burden of proof on the counterclaim” (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In any event, the Defendant’s argument ignored a number of important factual differences between <span class="font-italic">SIC </span><span class="font-italic">College</span> and the present case. Based on the facts in <span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>, there was basis for the court to conclude that Koo (who had prepared the print-out) was someone “affiliated” with Ken Yeo: in particular, together with Chua, they had filed a common defence to the appellant’s claims against them (at [14] and [16]). In contrast, in the<span class="font-italic"> </span>present case, there was no evidence to suggest that David King – who had, as financial controller of the Suntech Power group, overseen the preparation of the accounts by the group’s accounting department in Wuxi – was in some way “affiliated” with Dr Shi and/or that he was somehow “not independent” of Dr Shi. Even more importantly, the Defendant’s argument ignored the fact that in <span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>, the person who had supplied the information on the transactions in the print-out (Ken Yeo) was the very person whose claim the print-out was intended to prove (Ken Yeo). This was clearly not the case before me, where the person alleged to have been the main source of the information in the Defendant’s accounts (Dr Shi) was not the person putting forward the claims which these accounts were said to provide corroborative evidence of (the Plaintiff in liquidation). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I also noted that the Defendant made the rather sweeping submission that documents emanating from the Wuxi restructuring should not be regarded as independent corroborative evidence but failed to explain why this was so apart from making the bald statement that the documents had been signed by Dr Shi and David King when they “were the Plaintiff’s officer holders”.

</div>
</div> this allegation was not borne out. The Defendant’s only argument in this respect appeared to be based on the fact that the Liquidators’ summation of the individual transactions tallied with the total debt figures shown in the Defendant’s accounts and the Wuxi restructuring documents. This amounted really to a circular argument which – if accepted – would have placed the Liquidators in an impossible “Catch-22” position. If their summation of the individual transactions had not resulted in a total debt figure matching the total indebtedness in the Defendant’s accounts and/or the Wuxi restructuring documents, no doubt the Defendants would have said that such discrepancy showed the Liquidators’ computations to be arbitrary and baseless – and yet perversely, when the summation of the individual liabilities tallied exactly with the total debt shown in the other documents, such consistency was denounced as being indicative of “reverse engineering”. Moreover, insofar as the Defendant appeared to be insinuating some sleight of hand on the Liquidators’ part, this was entirely unwarranted. As seen from Jong’s evidence (summarised earlier at [24] to [32]), each individual transaction making up the Defendant’s total indebtedness to the Plaintiff was evidenced not only by entries in the parties’ accounts but also by other documentary evidence such as payment applications, instructions to banks, bank credit/debit notes, and (where applicable) contractual documents and bills. The Liquidators’ computations have been carefully explained on affidavit; and I did not find their explanations at all contrived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Defendant also argued that in any event, insofar as proving the four loan claims was concerned, the Plaintiff must be barred from referring to evidence of any fund transfers or individual transactions or liabilities other than the four loan claims <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span>”) (at [24]) for the above proposition. With respect, however, <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span> provided no support for the Defendant’s argument. The passages in the judgment which precede the paragraph relied on by the Defendant made it clear that the Court of Appeal was simply reaffirming the well-established principle that facts material to a party’s claim (or defence) must be pleaded (see <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span> at [22]–[23]). This principle is encapsulated in O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The same rule – which the appellate court cited at [22] of <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span> – states clearly that it is material facts which must be pleaded, “but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved”. In respect of the four loan claims, the material facts were the transfer of the relevant sums of money, the purpose of these transfers, and the obligation on the Defendant’s part to repay the sums. These have been pleaded by the Plaintiff. In respect of other transactions which did not form part of the four loan claims, these formed evidence which went towards supporting the Plaintiff’s case on the four alleged loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Defendant contended that the Plaintiff’s reliance on evidence of transactions other than the four alleged loans constituted an “ambush” which had “effectively deprived the Defendant of an opportunity to properly investigate and respond to these transactions”.

</div> With respect, this contention was in my view disingenuous. At the very latest, the Defendant would have been well aware upon receipt of Jong’s AEIC of 24 April 2017 that the Plaintiff was making reference to evidence of transactions other than the four alleged loans. The previous 2017 trial dates had been vacated by virtue of the Defendant’s last-minute striking-out application. I found it unbelievable that the Defendant should have had no opportunity at all to “investigate and respond to these transactions” in the intervening period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It must also be pointed out that throughout these proceedings, the Defendant had repeatedly asserted prior to the trial its lack of access to relevant documents and lamented its disadvantaged position as a result of this alleged lack of access.  In Bai Yun’s 13th affidavit filed on 9 February 2018, for example, it was stated that when he and the present directors of the Defendants took over, “the Defendant had no documents relating to the Audits” previously conducted of its finances, and that it was the Plaintiff which had disclosed “records purportedly belonging to the Defendant”.

According to Bai Yun’s affidavit, when it “became clear to the Defendant” in “the course of the trial” that a certain issue had to be checked arising from documents adduced by the Plaintiffs, the Defendants made a request to Wuxi Suntech – and were provided with images of the relevant documents “on 16 May 2018, which were then tendered to Court on the same day” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the third day of the trial).

For the reasons I have set out in this section, I found that the documentary evidence was sufficiently detailed and cogent such that, in the absence of further explanation by the Defendant, I would have reached the conclusion that the Plaintiff had transferred the sums of money to the Defendant as loans. It would then also be incumbent on the Defendant to furnish an explanation for these transfers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s submission that the transfers were not meant to be loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In attempting to discharge its evidential burden, the Defendant contended that there was evidence showing that the transfers were never meant to be loans. I also did not accept these arguments for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138  First, in respect of the alleged loan of US$27,000,015, the Defendant harped on the fact that the documentation relating to this transaction had described the transfer of this sum from the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a “transfer” and had not used the word “loan” – whereas the subsequent transfer of this sum from the Defendant to Rietech (the Defendant’s subsidiary) was described in the documentation as a “Shareholder Loan to Rietech for capital injection to Zhenjiang Rende”.

</div> signed by Dr Shi and David King (the then-financial controller of the Suntech Power group), in referring to this transfer by the Plaintiff and a corresponding transfer of US$10m by SPH to the Defendant, it had been stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[i]n 2010, there was a transfer of funds from [SPH] and [the Plaintiff] to [Rietech] for the capital investment and injection in [Rietech] of US$37,000,015.

Having considered [28] of the letter against the contents of the Defendant’s audited financial statements for that financial year, I did not find that this paragraph had the effect of negating any obligation on the Defendant’s part to repay the US$27,000,015 received from the Plaintiff. As seen from the italicised words above, the representation that the Defendant would “not be liable to repay” the amount to the Plaintiff was plainly stated to be conditional on a default by Rietech in repaying the Defendant. In the audited financial statements, the amount of US$27,000,015 continued to be included in the liabilities owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff as at 31 December 2011, thereby accounting for the total amount of US$288,602,584 shown to be payable to the Plaintiff.

</div> The basis for this contention appeared to be an internal email dated 15 December 2010 which alluded to the funds for the US$20m transfer coming from the proceeds of sale of “Asia Silicon”. The Defendant alleged that Asia Silicon was its subsidiary company. However, this allegation did not appear to be borne out on the evidence available. As the Plaintiff pointed out, the evidence available suggested that Asia Silicon had become the Plaintiff’s subsidiary by the time of the sale to Gigawise: the Defendant’s own sub-ledger records showed that in December 2010, the Plaintiff had incurred a liability to the Defendant for “Transfer of Asia Silicon shares”, and that this had the effect of increasing the Plaintiff’s total liabilities <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Defendant from US$2,999,979.05 to US$22,999,979.05.

More importantly, the assertion that the US$20m transfer was not repayable because it came from the Defendant’s own funds was never pleaded as part of the Defence.

Secondly, it claimed that Yang had also agreed in cross-examination that he would “likely be engaged by the Plaintiff to enforce a judgment of this Court (comprising a ruling on the Share Transfer Claim) against the Defendant in the PRC”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Insofar as the second point was concerned, Yang in fact said no such thing. When the Defendant’s counsel suggested that he would expect his law firm to be “spearheading enforcement of the Singapore judgment in China”, Yang had stated that this was “theoretically” possible but had then pointed out that the limited amount of assets available for enforcement in the PRC proceedings made it “very unlikely” that there would be “duplicate” proceedings in the PRC to enforce a Singapore judgment. It is helpful in this regard to reproduce Yang’s response to counsel in full:

But on the other side, actually, in Shanghai court, there was [an] issue discussed, what I state to the court was, because apparently Shanghai Suntech’s assets and liabilities, they have very limited net value, so for any enforcement, even if when the plaintiff wins enforcement judgment in Shanghai, probably the case would already been wipe out in the company. So it’s very unlikely to have duplicate enforced proceedings. Why that was raised was, in the Shanghai court, it was raised by the defendant counsel say – say Shanghai court, if you exercise jurisdiction, all other claims are also going to come to Shanghai court. That could be a burden to the court. Then I explain to the court, in my view, because the assets [are] so limited, probably couldn’t satisfy all the claims, so long as we have judgment, we enforce even the 11 million, maybe the company is gone, so there’s no need for additional claim. So because of that, I think what you raise, theoretically, it’s natural, but, in this case, I don’t know whether it’s really realistic or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Insofar as the remark about “general duty” was concerned, this came about after the Defendant’s counsel had cross-examined Yang about a letter he sent on 4 September 2014 to the Plaintiffs’ then-solicitors, informing them of a potential disposal by the Defendant of Shanghai Suntech shares which was not covered by the freezing order imposed on the Defendant in the PRC proceedings.

</div> It was in response to this suggestion that Yang replied: “I think I would agree. I have a general duty.” The Defendant’s counsel did not follow up to suggest to Yang that this “general duty” therefore precluded him from being able to function act independently as an expert witness. Subsequently, Yang explained that prior to taking on the appointment as expert witness, he had obtained an express waiver from the Plaintiff whereby the latter had acknowledged that as expert witness, his first duty would be to the court and not to them. He also explained that he had required the Plaintiff – via this waiver – expressly to waive any claim against him or his firm, because he wanted to avoid the possibility of the Plaintiff “later thinking … what [he] told in court … might make them cause their damages or cause their difficulty”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Whilst Yang was indeed acting as counsel for the Plaintiff in the PRC proceedings, there was no evidence to show that the success of those proceedings depended on the success of the Singapore proceedings – or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. As seen from above, an attempt was made to show that Yang had a selfish interest in ensuring the success of the Singapore proceedings because it would mean that his firm would be handling subsequently enforcement of the Singapore judgment within the PRC – but the attempt was rebuffed by Yang, and no evidence was called to contradict him. Any suggestion that he might nevertheless wish to appease an erstwhile client (albeit in a different jurisdiction) by giving an expert opinion skewed in its favour was met with the fact that he had obtained from the Plaintiff a waiver which acknowledged the primacy of his duty to the court and waived any claims it might otherwise bring against him as a result of any evidence he gave as expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 To support its arguments about Yang’s lack of independence, the Defendant cited the case <span class="font-italic">Kaufman, Gregory Laurence </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Datacraft Asia Ltd and another</span> [2005] SGHC 174 (“<span class="font-italic">Kaufman</span>”)

</div> as an authority involving a “similar” situation. However, there was nothing “similar” at all about the facts in <span class="font-italic">Kaufman</span>. In that case, the dispute centred on the interpretation of an agreement entered into by the plaintiffs and the defendants (“the Letter Agreement”), which was governed by the laws of Japan. The plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled, by reason of the provisions of the Letter Agreement, to be given certain information and documents by the defendants; and they also wanted an account of what was due to them by reason of the provisions of the Letter Agreement. They argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the terms of the Letter Agreement created a relationship of entrustment between the parties. The defendants denied that the Letter Agreement had any such effect. Both sides produced expert witnesses on Japanese law to persuade the High Court of its interpretation of the Letter Agreement. The plaintiffs objected to the defendants’ expert, one Mr Okada, on the ground that he had been for years a partner of Freshfields, which was the law firm that had <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>advised the defendants and had been involved in the negotiations on the wording of the Letter Agreement. Prior to the commencement of the action, Freshfields had also responded to the plaintiffs’ solicitors by taking a position on the meaning and effect of some of the clauses in the Letter Agreement, and these were the very same clauses that Mr Okada was required to give his opinion on. The High Court noted that Mr Okada was not a member of the team defending the defendants and had not given instructions to counsel. The court held that “Mr Okada’s independence cannot be impugned”. It went on to hold, however, that it could not dismiss the possibility that if the defendants lost the action, they might consider recovering costs by taking action Freshfields if they judged that Freshfield’s advice on the interpretation of the Letter Agreement had caused them to incur unnecessary costs in defending the action. The court held that because of this “remote” but “distinct” possibility, it would scrutinise Mr Okada’s evidence with care where it conflicted with that of the plaintiffs’ expert (Mr Abe): it should accept such conflicting opinions only where it found them to be reasonable, measured and backed by authority or where Mr Abe’s contrary evidence was clearly unsound or had not been properly arrived at after consideration of all relevant factors (at [33]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 From the foregoing, it is clear that the expert in <span class="font-italic">Kaufman</span> was placed in a much more sensitive and difficult position than Yang in the present case – and even in those circumstances, the High Court did not find the expert’s independence to be impugned. The court assessed that there remained a “remote” possibility of conflict of interest because of the risk of the defendants suing Freshfields if they lost the case – but that “remote” possibility did not even exist in the present case because of the express waiver given by the Plaintiff to Yang. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For the reasons set out above, I did not find Yang’s independence to be impugned, and I rejected the Defendant’s argument that his expert evidence should be given no weight. In my view, the most that could be said by the Defendant was that since the Plaintiff continued to be Yang’s client, even with an express waiver, he might be subconsciously predisposed towards wanting the Plaintiff to do well in the litigation. I stress that there was no evidence before me of any such predisposition on Yang’s part: indeed, he struck me as quite a candid witness. It was out of an abundance of caution that I decided I should scrutinise Yang’s evidence with care where it conflicted with Sun’s, and accept such conflicting opinions only where they were reasonable, measured and backed by authority or where Sun’s contrary evidence was clearly unsound or had not been properly arrived at after consideration of all relevant factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Additionally, whilst the Defendant has claimed that Yang was straying beyond his remit as an expert witness and advocating on the Plaintiff’s behalf in the course of his evidence

</div> She also stated that since there was only one method of payment provided for in cl 3.2, cl 14.3 of the Equity Transfer Agreement would have required any amendments to that one method of payment to be made in writing signed off by the parties.  However, this interpretation entailed ignoring entirely the second sentence in cl 3.2 – without any explanation as to what the effect of this second sentence might be. When Sun was asked what meaning should then be attributed to the second sentence in the clause beginning with the word “or” after the semi-colon”, she was unable to provide any coherent response.

</div> This regrettably did not make much sense because the second sentence in cl 3.2 did in fact expressly refer to “the method of payment” of the share price and the transfer of the shares by stating that they “may be carried out in any manner as recognized by the Parties”.  It is reasonable to expect that corporate entities entering into a commercial contract must have intended each distinct sentence in a contractual clause to bear some distinct meaning – unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise.  Yang’s interpretation, which would give effect to every sentence in cl 3.2, should <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be preferred over Sun’s interpretation, which would render the second sentence in cl 3.2 otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I should add that although in its Closing Submissions, the Defendant argued that the words “method of payment” could not under PRC law be construed as encompassing or referring to the timing of the payment,

</div> this proposition was never put to Yang in cross-examination; and Sun herself gave no such evidence in her expert report. Indeed, in her evidence, Sun spoke at times of “the method of payment and the time of payment” but also at times of “only one method of payment, and that is within ten working days as from the transfer effective date”. She was not asked by the Defendant’s counsel to confirm that “method of payment” could never under PRC law encompass or refer to the timing of payment. In the circumstances, the Defendant had no basis for arguing that under PRC law, the words “method of payment” would never be capable of referring to the timing of the payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I also noted that whilst Sun claimed that cl 14.3 required that all amendments to the contract be in writing and signed by both parties before they could be valid, she did not manage to explain how the words of cl 14.3 gave rise to this requirement. The relevant portions of cl 14.3 state as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.3.1 The Parties agree that, after this Agreement goes into effect, the Parties may have further negotiations as regards any matter under this Agreement and enter into another written agreement, which constitutes an integral part of this Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.3.2 This Agreement may be modified if such amendment is in writing and signed by both the Parties, and such modification will constitute an integral part of this Agreement[.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 These clauses appeared therefore to be couched in permissive terms: there did not appear to be any word or phrase capable of being construed as mandating strictly the signed documentation of all amendments as a pre-requisite to validity.

</div> that “no evidence of any purported amendment or variation shall be admissible” in the absence of signed written amendments appeared to be her own gloss on cl 14.3 which was not supported by the terms of the said clause or by any provision of PRC law. I found it telling that in the further expert report enclosed in her second affidavit filed on 19 April 20018, in repeating that cl 14.3 “<span class="font-italic">requires</span> that <span class="font-italic">all</span> variations be recorded in a written agreement signed by both parties”, she merely cited again the same paragraph from her first expert report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Sun also refused to engage on the issue of how Arts 36, 37 and 77 of the PRC Contract Law might affect her argument as to why cl 14.3 should be read as allowing only written, signed amendments. Yang had cited these provisions of the PRC Contract Law in order to demonstrate that PRC law expressly empowered parties to form (including to amend) contracts through their conduct, even if there existed a prior requirement of written form.

These provisions of the PRC Contract Law raised question marks over Sun’s insistence that cl 14.3 be read – even in the absence of any mandatory language – as allowing only written and signed amendments. It was regrettable that she chose not to address the effect of these legislative provisions beyond making the bald assertion that they were “not relevant”.

</div> (“the Sign-off Memo”). This was essentially a document signed by the then-management team of the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s ultimate parent company (SPH), endorsing the transfer of the equity interest in Shanghai Suntech and alluding to certain aspects of the transaction. The signatories included Dr Shi and Amy Zhang, whom parties agreed were also common directors of both the Plaintiff and the Defendant at the material time. As such, it was not disputed as between the parties that the Sign-off Memo provided an indication of their mutual understanding of the terms of the equity transfer. What they disagreed on was the nature of that understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In this connection, two main points of interest arose from the Sign-off Memo.  First, it will be recalled that Sun had given evidence that cl 3.2 “expressed … only one method of payment, and that is within ten working days as from the transfer effective date”; further, that any amendment to the timeline for payment would have to be effected in writing and signed off by both parties. Although the Defendant claimed the Sign-off Memo provided supporting “contextual evidence” for Sun’s interpretation, it in fact stated a different timeline for payment from that postulated by Sun: instead of referring to “<span class="font-italic">ten</span> <span class="font-italic">working days</span> as from the <span class="font-italic">Transfer Effective Date</span>”, the Sign-off Memo stated the payment timeline as “Within <span class="font-italic">10 days</span> from <span class="font-italic">Signing Date</span>”. The Defendant argued that this showed that parties “intended for payment to be made within a <span class="font-underline">fixed duration</span>, i.e. within 10 days after the share transfer or the signing date of the ETA” [emphasis in original].

</div> With respect, this argument was not only contrived – it did not even represent Sun’s evidence. Indeed, the proposition that parties had provided in cl 3.2 for payment “within a fixed duration, i.e. within 10 days after the share transfer or the signing date of the ETA” was not even put to Yang when he pointed out the differences between the first limb of cl 3.2 and the “term of payment” stated in the Sign-off Memo.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 It should be noted that the Sign-off Memo alluded to a different timeline for payment from that stated in the first sentence of cl 3.2 without any evidence of such modification having been the subject of a signed, written contractual amendment. Moreover, whilst the first sentence in cl 3.2 referred to payment via transfer of monies into a bank account nominated by the transferor, the Sign-off Memo stated that the payment could “be offset completely without actual payment because the Transferee [was] 100% owned by the Transferor” – again with no evidence of such modification having been the subject of a signed, written contractual amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 As things turned out, the share consideration was not paid within ten days of the signing date, nor has there been any evidence of it being “offset”. The point, however, is that insofar as it specified payment arrangements clearly differing from what was stated in the first sentence of cl 3.2, the Sign-off Memo contradicted Sun’s thesis that the parties had drafted cl 3.2 so as to permit only one method of payment and that any modifications had to be in writing and signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Secondly, the purpose of the contract was stated in the Sign-off Memo to be an “internal shareholding restructuring” for “better corporate tax planning at Suntech Holding level”. Notably, the Sign-off Memo did not say the timing for the payment of the share consideration was important; it said that the timing for the equity transfer was important because Shanghai Suntech was “currently a relatively new company with limited profit record so the transfer can be priced at paid-in capital of the Company, otherwise the share transfer has to be based on market value which will result in much higher transfer cost”. This evidence appeared to me to provide support for Yang’s proposition that given the main purpose of the Equity Transfer Agreement was to effect a share transfer, a PRC court would likely find that “the timing of the payment of the share transfer price was not the key focus of the parties”.

</div>
</div> This fundamental factual error led me seriously to question whether Sun had even examined the Defendant’s audited financials before dismissing their evidential value. She did not cite in any event any specific provisions of PRC law and/or judicial pronouncements to support her assertion that the audited financials would not be given any weight by the PRC courts in interpreting the Equity Transfer Agreement. Indeed, given the definition of “trade practices” in Art 7(1) of the Interpretation of the Supreme Court on Certain Issues Concerning the Application of the PRC Contract Law (II), there appeared to be no reason why parties’ accounting practices in respect of a particular debt should not be relevant evidence in the court’s consideration of the contractual clause relating to that debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In the circumstances, I accepted that in determining the meaning of cl 3.2, the accounting treatment accorded by the parties to the amount of US$55,560,000 formed relevant evidence to be taken into consideration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Plaintiff’s claim for the unpaid share consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Having considered the facts before me, I did not find Sun’s evidence to be sound, nor did she appear to have arrived at her conclusions after consideration of all relevant factors. In contrast, I found Yang’s evidence to be reasonable, measured and backed by authority. As I have explained, I did not find Yang to have crossed the line into advocating for the Plaintiff. Whilst he did at various points in his evidence speak of how he thought the PRC courts would treat a particular issue or a piece of evidence put forward by the Plaintiff, there was nothing impermissible or untoward about this process (see [158] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I accepted his evidence that cl 3.2 provided for two alternative approaches to payment. The first approach – which was the default position – stipulated that the transferee [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Defendant] would transfer the money entirely to the bank account designated by the transferor [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff] at one time within ten working days from the Transfer Effective Date. If this “default” approach was not adopted, then the alternative, “second approach” would be for payment to be carried out in “any manner as recognised by the Parties”. I rejected the Defendant’s submission that the “second approach” was invalid under PRC law. I also rejected the submission that assuming the “second approach” was valid in law, any agreement on an alternative “second approach” had to be made in writing and signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I next considered the Plaintiff’s submission that the parties had, using the “second approach” provided for in cl 3.2, agreed that the outstanding share consideration should be payable on demand. I considered the evidence of the words and sentences used in cl 3.2, the purpose of the contract, and the parties’ trade practices (in terms of the accounting treatment accorded to the amount of US$55,560,000). Having regard to the matters examined at [161] to [187] above, I found that the evidence did indeed show the parties to have come to a consensus that the outstanding share consideration would be payable on demand pursuant to the “second approach” provided for in cl 3.2. I do not find it necessary to repeat all the evidence examined in these preceding paragraphs, but will say that I found the following to be especially helpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The words and sentences used in cl 3.2 – and in particular the alternative provision for payment to be “carried out in any manner as recognized by the Parties” – indicated clearly that the parties never intended to put in place a single inflexible set of terms for payment of the share consideration. This is borne out by the fact that the Sign-off Memo signed by SPH senior management (including individuals who were common directors of the Plaintiff and the Defendant) on the same day as the Equity Transfer Agreement expressly alluded to payment terms which differed from the default “first approach” stated in cl 3.2 (see [178] to [180] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Moreover, although the “first approach” provided for the Plaintiff to nominate a bank account into which payment would be made, no bank account was nominated, and there was no evidence either of the Defendant having requested the Plaintiff to make such nomination. This supported the Plaintiff’s case that the parties had intended all along to adopt a flexible approach towards the payment of the share consideration. The reason for this became clear when one considered that the purpose of the equity transfer – as stated in the Sign-off Memo – was to effect “internal shareholding restructuring” for “better corporate tax planning at Suntech Holding level”. In other words, the equity transfer was effected for strategic purposes: the flow of funds to the Plaintiff arising from the transfer of the shares was not the parties’ key focus. Subsequent to the equity transfer taking effect, the fact that the outstanding payment was booked by the Defendant in its accounts as part of the total unsecured liabilities payable on demand to the Plaintiff – as well as the corresponding records in the Plaintiff’s accounts – showed that there was a consensus between the parties that the outstanding amount would be payable on demand. The demand was duly made by the Liquidators in their letter of 23 December 2013; and the writ in these proceedings having been filed in January 2014, the Plaintiff was well within the two-year limitation period specified under PRC law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 For the reasons given above, I found that the Plaintiff had made out its claim for the unpaid share consideration of US$55,560,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remaining points raised by the Plaintiff and the Defendant at various stages of the proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Finally, I address a number of remaining points which were raised by the Plaintiff and the Defendant respectively at various stages of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff’s causes of action were extinguished or relinquished</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195  First, it will be recalled that the Defendant had pleaded in its Defence that the Plaintiff “ceased to have any relevant right of action against the Defendant in respect of all or part of such alleged liability, following upon the acquisition by Wuxi Suntech of the Plaintiff’s interests in the Defendant”.

</div>  This was a positive assertion on which the Defendant would have borne the legal and the evidential burden: see [75] above. However, the Defendant chose not to call any factual witnesses. No evidence was produced by the Defendant to support the assertion that the Wuxi Suntech restructuring had resulted in the Plaintiff’s causes of action against the Defendant being somehow extinguished or relinquished. Indeed, the issue was not brought up by the Defendant at all in the course of the trial, and no questions relating to this issue were put to Jong. As such, the only finding possible was that the Defendant had failed to make out this aspect of its pleaded Defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s plea of set-off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Secondly, in its Closing Submissions, the Defendant argued that “even if the Plaintiff [succeeded] in establishing the Alleged Loan Claims, the amount owing by the Defendant should be set-off against the amount [of US$22,999,979.05 owing] to the Defendant”. However, this purported right to a set-off was never pleaded by the Defendant; and the court cannot make findings on facts which have not been pleaded (see <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng </span>(<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [142]) at [41]. The Defendant sought to rely on [8(d)] of the Defence, but I did not find it possible to read the words “the Plaintiff ceased to have any relevant right of action against the Defendant in respect of all or part of such alleged liability” as being an adequate pleading of the defence of set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In any event, as the Plaintiff pointed out, there was no evidence to suggest that there had been – or that there should be a netting-off between the amounts owed by the Plaintiff to the Defendant and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. Jong, in re-examination, stated clearly that he did not agree there had been any set-off of the liabilities owed between the parties. Conversely, the Defendant’s own sub-ledger consistently showed that the liabilities of the Plaintiff to the Defendant remained on the Defendant’s ledger until the amount of US$22,999,979.05 was written off as a bad debt following the Plaintiff’s liquidation in November 2013.

Bearing in mind the guiding principles established in these authorities, I considered the respective roles played by Bai Yun and He Yue in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 In respect of Bai Yun, as the Plaintiff has pointed out, he affirmed nearly all of the Defendant’s affidavits in these proceedings up to the point the trial commenced – and even thereafter.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Given the positive assertions made by Bai Yun as to “integral” aspects of the Defendant’s defence, it was extremely odd that the Defendant elected not to call him as a witness in the trial, nor to offer him for cross-examination. The Defendant proffered no explanation as to why Bai Yun was unavailable as a witness in the trial; and given that he filed a 16th affidavit on the Defendant’s behalf not long after the evidence in the trial was concluded, it did not appear that he was in any way incapacitated or inhibited from testifying as a defence witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 I also noted that Bai Yun had filed the affidavits verifying the Defendant’s lists of documents in these proceedings – which affidavits required him to affirm that “[n]either the Defendant, nor its solicitors nor any other person on its behalf” had or ever had in its possession, custody or power any documents relevant to any matter in question in this action. What was interesting was that while Bai Yun had filed his 3rd affidavit verifying the Defendant’s 3rd list of documents on 7 March 2018, the Defendant’s 4th and 5th lists of documents were filed on 14 May 2018 and 18 May 2018 respectively without any verifying affidavits. Bai Yun’s 16th affidavit verifying these two additional lists of documents – as well as a 6th list of documents – was eventually filed on 13 June 2018, after evidence-taking in the trial had been completed and whilst parties were preparing their closing submissions. The belated filing of this 16th affidavit, coupled with the Defendant’s failure to call Bai Yun as a witness, meant that the Plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to question him about the Defendant’s access to relevant evidence. This was a relevant issue given that the Defendant had maintained throughout the proceedings its lack of relevant documents.

It was also represented that these details were based on his “review of the relevant documents” and “confidential discussions”

All that was said in the Defendant’s closing submissions was that the Defendant’s directors had no “personal knowledge of the various transactions in issue”, and that “[a]ccordingly, in light of such objections taken by the Plaintiff against He Yue’s [AEIC]’, a decision had been made “not to lead evidence from” him.
