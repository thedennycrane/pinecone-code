<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction and background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In January 2008, Internech Systems Pte Ltd
                    (“Internech”) commenced an action against LaserResearch (S) Pte
                    Ltd (“LaserResearch”) for the sum of $81,451.15 in unpaid invoices
                    (“the DC Suit”). LaserResearch admitted 14 out of the 25 invoices
                    Internech’s claim was based on, and the former duly made payment after the
                    Writ of Summons was issued in the District Court (<em>ie</em>, the DC Suit). It disputed the remaining 11 invoices, which
                    totalled $62,142.94, on the basis that the goods under those documents were not
                    delivered to it or to persons who had authority to accept the goods on its
                    behalf. Internech applied for summary judgment for the balance of its claim on
                    the 11 invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the hearing of the application for summary
                    judgment, the Deputy Registrar entered judgment on four of the invoices,
                    totalling $1,260.31 and granted LaserResearch leave to defend the claim against
                    the remaining seven invoices, totalling $60,884.63, on the condition that it
                    furnished a banker’s guarantee in Internech’s favour.
                    Internech’s appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s conditional order
                    was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       LaserResearch duly put its bank in funds and
                    secured the required banker’s guarantee on 28 August 2008. On
                    24 April 2009, Internech filed an Affidavit Verifying List of Documents.
                    No further formal steps in the proceedings were taken in the DC Suit after
                    that. The parties’ lawyers continued to communicate, however, in the
                    search for a settlement. The date of the last correspondence between the
                    parties’ lawyers on the matter was 4 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 15 May 2009, LaserResearch went into
                    provisional liquidation and a provisional liquidator was appointed on
                    15 May 2009 by way of directors’ resolution and accompanying
                    statutory declaration of the company’s inability to continue with the
                    company’s business. Both documents were duly filed with the Accounting and
                    Corporate Regulatory Authority. In the normal course of events, Internech
                    received a letter dated 18 May 2009 giving it notice that a
                    creditors’ meeting was to be convened on 12 June 2009. While at that
                    time it had been in the midst of preparing affidavits of evidence-in-chief of
                    their witnesses for the trial, its solicitors advised that the DC Suit had been
                    stayed as a result of the winding up and that the company could not proceed with
                    the DC Suit except by leave of court. Rather than seek leave of court to
                    continue with the proceedings, Internech instead filed proof of debt against
                    LaserResearch on 1 June 2009. On 12 June 2009, at the creditors’
                    meeting, a liquidator was appointed. It is common ground that commencement date
                    of the creditors’ voluntary winding up of LaserResearch was 15 May
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 5 February 2010, LaserResearch’s
                    solicitors wrote to Internech requesting that the banker’s guarantee be
                    returned together with a written confirmation that the former could proceed to
                    effect cancellation of the banker’s guarantee in view of its liquidation.
                    In the same letter, LaserResearch’s solicitors drew attention to
                    Internech’s inaction in DC Suit since May 2009. Internech was also
                    informed that an application would be taken out should the request not be
                    acceded to by 5.00 pm on 18 February 2010. No reply was received by
                    that deadline and the liquidator, accordingly, commenced the present application
                    (viz Originating Summons No 495 of 2010 (“OS 495”)) for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an order to cancel the
                    banker’s guarantee on the ground that DC Suit was deemed discontinued
                    under O 21 r 2(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). It is common ground that more than one
                    year had lapsed since the last step in the proceedings on 24 April 2009
                    (“the trigger date”). OS 495 was filed more than one year after
                    the trigger date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The facts are undisputed, and for the purpose of
                    OS 495, the narrow issue before me was simply whether time continued to run
                    under O 21 r 2(6) of the ROC even though the proceedings had already
                    been stayed by virtue of s 299(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) on 15 May 2009. This issue turns on the interpretation
                    of, and inter-relationship between a statutory stay of proceedings pursuant to
                    s 299(2) of the Companies Act and the strict language of O 21
                    r 2(6A) which refers only to stay of proceedings pursuant to an order of
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion and conclusions on the issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The relevant parts of O 21 r 2 read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    Subject to paragraph 6(a), if no party to an
                            action or cause or matter has, <em>for more than one
                                year</em> (or such extended period as the Court may allow
                            under paragraph (6B)), taken any step or proceeding in the action, cause
                            or matter that appears from records maintained by the Court, the action,
                            cause or matter is deemed to have been discontinued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6A)  Paragraph 6 shall not apply where the action,
                            cause or matter has been stayed pursuant to an order of
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6B)  The Court may, on an application by any party
                            made <em>before</em> the one year referred to in
                            paragraph (6) has elapsed, extend the time to such extent as it may
                            think fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is also convenient to now set out the text of
                    s 299(2) of the Companies Act pertaining to creditors’ voluntary
                    winding up:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) After the commencement of the winding up no action or proceeding shall
                        be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the
                        Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before me, opposing arguments were canvassed on
                    the inter-relation of the two provisions above. Internech, who was represented
                    by Mr Ng Yeow Khoon (“Mr Ng”), pointed out that since DC
                    Suit was already stayed under s 299(2) of the Companies Act, O 21
                    r 2(6) did not apply. Mr Ng submitted that the purpose of the deeming
                    provision is to catch tardy litigants, not actions that are automatically stayed
                    by legislation like, for example, s 299(2) of the Companies Act. In
                    contrast, counsel for LaserReasearch, Mr Terence Tan
                    (“Mr Tan”) asserted that even though the DC Suit was stayed
                    by virtue of s 299(2), time continued to run under O 21 r 2(6) as
                    the statutory stay was <em>not</em> “pursuant to an
                    order of court” as prescribed by O 21 r 2(6A). In effect,
                    Mr Tan contended that the proper procedure Internech ought to have adopted
                    was to first seek leave of court to lift the statutory stay on the DC Suit, and
                    to follow thereafter with an application for an order of court to stay the same
                    DC Suit under O 21 r 2(6A) (hereafter referred to as “the
                    suggested procedural steps”). The suggested procedural steps would have
                    to be taken <em>before</em> the guillotine date as time
                    continued to run O 21 r 2(6). Mr Tan also suggested another way
                    to avoid the guillotine date by extending the 12-month period under O 21
                    r 2(6B). Again there is a need to first lift the stay under s 299(2)
                        <em>before</em> resorting to O 21
                    r 2(6B).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Section 19(c) of the Interpretation Act
                    (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), which Mr Ng directed my attention to,
                    provides that “no subsidiary legislation made under an Act shall be
                    inconsistent with the provisions of any Act”. In a conflict between
                    subsidiary legislation and a primary legislation, the latter will prevail.
                    However, this is not an instance of conflict falling within the ambit of
                    s 19(c). Rather, the rival submissions of counsel point to two possible
                    readings of the inter-relation of a statutory provision and a rule in a
                    subsidiary legislation. The starting point, therefore, is to ascertain the
                    rationale of s 299(2) of the Companies Act and O 21r 2(6) of ROC,
                    and thereafter examine their differences, if any, in terms of their respective
                    purpose and function.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I begin with s 299(2) of the Companies
                    Act. The prohibition against commencing or proceeding with an action or other
                    proceeding against a company upon the commencement of a creditors’
                    voluntary winding up without leave of court is found in s 299(2) of the
                    Companies Act. This statutory stay is an important statutory feature with
                    respect to liquidation of companies. Upon commencement of winding up, a
                    statutory regime (which provisions are contained in the Companies Act and the
                    Companies (Winding Up) Rules) aimed at the orderly realisation of the debtor
                    company’s assets and the fair and equitable settlement of its
                    creditors’ claims is triggered. Similar provisions are found in
                    s 262(3) of the Companies Act which applies to compulsory winding up, and
                    s 227(c) which deals with judicial management, and also in ss 45(3), 56F
                    and 76 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). The rationale of
                    s 299(2) and the statutory ring fencing regime that arises upon winding up
                    (which also applies with equal force to a bankruptcy) has been considered in
                        <em>Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd
                        (in liquidation)</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 671 (“<em>Korea Asset Management</em>”) at [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is to prevent the company from being further burdened by
                        expenses incurred in defending unnecessary litigation. The main focus of a
                        company and its liquidators once winding up has commenced should be to
                        prevent the fragmentation of its assets and to ensure that the interests of
                        its creditors are protected to the fullest extent. In other words, returns
                        to legitimate creditors should be maximised; the process of collecting
                        assets and returning them to legitimate creditors should be attended to with
                        all practicable speed. Unnecessary costs should not be incurred; liquidators
                        should act in the collective interests of all legitimate stakeholders and
                        not with a view to enhancing their own self-interests or fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In other words (see <em>Woon’s Corporations Law</em>, Issue 34 (2010), LexisNexis at
                    para 3753):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of s 299(2) ... is to preserve the limited assets of the
                        company in the best way for distribution among all the persons who have
                        claims upon them. As the fund is limited, it ought not to be diminished
                        because of costs incurred due to actions against the company. ... The policy
                        in winding up is that all claims should generally be disposed of by the
                        cheap summary procedure of proving a debt in the winding up rather than by
                        dissipating the assets in a multiplicity of suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I keep in mind the purpose and function of
                    s 299(2) as I turn now to examine O 21 r 2 of ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The relevant extracts of O 21 r 2
                    have already been set out above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>.
                    Order 21 r 2(6) is intended to cut down delays in litigation. The rule
                    is intended to ensure that litigants progress the action expeditiously. The
                    deeming provision in O 21 r 2(6) obviates the need for separate
                    applications to strike out dormant actions for want of prosecution. In <em>Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adams</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 181at [20], it was explained that the rationale behind
                    O 21 r 2 was “the maintenance of an efficient judicial system
                    which required less policing, with the imposition of drastic consequences for
                    tardy litigants”. The deemed discontinuance provision does not operate
                    where the action has been stayed “pursuant to an order of court”
                    (see O 21 r 2(6A)). A stay order is granted if the court is persuaded
                    to halt the court proceedings, and with that time stops running for the 12-month
                    period. Another way of avoiding the 12-month guillotine is to extend the
                    12-month period under O 21 r 2(6B) so long as the appropriate
                    application is made <em>before</em> the guillotine
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Given that the purpose of s 299(2) is the
                    preservation of an insolvent company’s assets, and that the purpose of
                    O 21 r 2(6) is to ensure litigants progress actions expeditiously,
                    could the suggested procedural steps advocated by Mr Tan have been intended
                    by the draftsmen? I am not persuaded that it is so. Mr Tan was unable to
                    cite me any cases supporting any of his propositions, and in any event, there
                    are a number of difficulties with his submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     LaserResearch’s construction of
                    O 21 r 2(6A) and s 299(2) of the Companies Act from where
                    Mr Tan’s suggested procedural steps are derived, produces a result
                    that is manifestly at odds with the purpose of s 299(2). Instead of
                    conserving the insolvent company’s assets, adopting Mr Tan’s
                    construction of O 21 r 2(6A) and s 299 of the Companies Act would
                    mean that further cost had to be incurred by the company in winding up for
                    purely procedural reasons. Neither is the purpose of O 21 r 2(6)
                    served (<em>ie</em>, to cut down delays in litigation), as
                    even after following Mr Tan’s suggested procedural steps, the action
                    is to be stayed for an indefinite period of time rather than continued. The only
                    result is duplicity, and a waste of time and costs and the court’s
                    resources</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Tan’s suggested procedural steps
                    produce an absurd result as to the way the rule is to operate. One well-known
                    interpretative presumption of relevance to the issue here is that the court
                    seeks to avoid a construction that produces an absurd result. Several aspects of
                    this general presumption against absurdity come to mind, and they are equally
                    applicable here: (a) avoidance of a futile or pointless result, and (b)
                    pointless legal proceedings. Francis Bennion, <em>Statutory
                        Interpretation</em> (LexisNexis, 2008, 5<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed) (“<em>Bennion</em>”) explains these two
                    aspects as follows (at pp 1000 and 1001):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Futile or pointless result</em> Parliament does
                        nothing in vain, a principle also expressed as <em>lex nil
                            frustra facit</em> (the law does nothing in vain). It is an old
                        maxim of the law that <em>quod vanum et inutile est, lex non
                            requirit</em> (the law does not call for what is vain and
                        useless). Or as it is put in another form: <em>lex non
                            praecipit inutilia</em> (the law does not demand the doing of
                        useless things). The law never compels a person to do that is useless and
                        unnecessary. Through the inevitable limitations of language, it is sometimes
                        nevertheless happens that, in the events that have occurred in the instant
                        case, the literal meaning of the enactment seems to demand the doing of
                        something that would be futile or pointless. Here the court will strive to
                        find a more sensible construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Pointless legal proceedings</em> The court is
                        always averse to requiring litigants to embark on futile or unnecessary
                        legal proceedings. This includes a stage in proceedings that could without
                        detriment to any party be done without. Judges are uncomfortably aware of
                        the costs and delays involved in a legal action, and do all in their power
                        to minimise them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In this present case, the absurdity and
                    irrationality of the construction as described in the passages above in
                        <em>Bennion</em> reside in the suggested procedural
                    steps: an action that has already been statutorily stayed has to be revived for
                    the sole objective of not continuing with the action but to halt proceedings by
                    a court order. That is not all. This approach, which forms the basis of the
                    application, hardly qualifies as a proper ground for lifting the statutory stay.
                    It must be remembered that the court’s power under s 299(2) is to
                    grant leave to <em>proceed</em> or <em>continue</em> with the court proceedings outside of resolution of
                    claims within the insolvency regime. It requires the applicant to satisfy the
                    court that there are compelling reasons for lifting the stay to proceed or
                    continue with the court proceedings as there is a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case to be <em>tried</em> (see
                        <em>Korea Asset Management</em> at [41]). To proceed or
                    continue with court proceedings would mean diverting limited resources from an
                    insolvent company to deal with court proceedings. Normally leave would be
                    refused under s 299(2) if the dispute in the action can be decided in the
                    course of the winding up within the insolvency regime. The first stage of the
                    suggested procedural steps has demonstrably shown itself to be unworkable since
                    the primary objective for granting leave to lift the statutory stay is not
                    likely to be met. One way of testing the correctness of this conclusion is from
                    the court’s case management perspective. If the action had been stayed
                    under s 299(2), the court as part of case management is not likely to
                    intervene in the progress of the action since it is already
                stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The analysis above underlines the different
                    perspective and different intentions of a statutory stay under s 299(2) and
                    the court ordered stay under O21r 2(6A). Contrary to Mr Ng’s
                    contention, there is no inconsistency between the statutory stay under
                    s 299(2) and a stay order under O 21 r 2(6A). Both substantive
                    and procedural laws can co-exist harmoniously, each serving different objectives
                    and functions. Whilst both substantive and procedural laws lead to the same
                    result (<em>ie</em>, the court proceedings are halted), the
                    similarities end there. Even so, at this level, the suggested procedural steps
                    intended to stop time from running is patently unnecessary because as mentioned
                    above they are pointless for duplicity, and a waste of time and costs and the
                    court’s resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On first principles, the better view (and this
                    is not an unreasonable one since both substantive and procedural laws can
                    co-exist) is that whenever an action is automatically stayed by operation of
                    s 299(2) of the Companies Act (or for that matter under the other
                    corresponding provisions in the Companies Act or the Bankruptcy Act on automatic
                    stays listed at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), the action is
                    excluded and <em>not</em> subject to the 12-month period
                    prescribed by O 21 r 2(6). (This is not to say that the creditor whose
                    action is stayed by operation of s 299(2) can take an indefinite amount of
                    time to decide whether it wants to proceed by proof of debt or by litigation in
                    court – one would imagine that should the creditor come before the court
                    after an unreasonably long time to seek a lift of the stay, the court would have
                    justifiable reason to refuse unless otherwise persuaded. See also <em>Korea Asset Management</em> at [47].) I do not read the
                    provision of O 21 r 2(6A) to be exhaustive by implication so as to
                    exclude or disapply a statutory stay prescribed <em>aliunde</em>. It goes without saying that it is a principle in
                    statutory interpretation that unless a contrary intention appears, the ROC,
                    which is a subsidiary legislation, and in particular O 21 r 2(6A) must
                    be construed and applied within the context of the existing corpus of law, and
                    in this case, the primary legislation is s 299(2) of the Companies Act and
                    regard must be given to it in construing O 21 r 2(6A) (see <em>Bennion</em> Part XXIII, Section 327 at p1033; generally
                    s19(c) of the Interpretation Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As stated, upon the commencement of winding
                    up, a statutory regime is triggered; the automatic stay under s 299(2) is
                    meant to facilitate the change in regime. The proper route for a creditor is
                    usually to file a proof of debt with the liquidator instead of continuing with
                    the court process unless it satisfies the court that it meets the broad
                    guidelines set out by Rajah JC in <em>Korea Asset
                        Management</em> at [45] - [57] and obtains the leave of court to
                    commence or continue proceedings despite the fact that the company it wishes to
                    sue is in liquidation. Order 21 r 2(6) is clearly intended to apply to court
                    proceedings that have become dormant because one party had allowed the
                    proceedings to go to sleep. In the present case, the commencement of the winding
                    up of LaserResearch on 15 May 2009 which triggered the automatic stay under
                    s 299(2) of the Companies Act takes the DC Suit out of the ambit of the
                    Rules of Court altogether so that O 21 r 2(6) does not apply to the
                    cause or matter in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For these reasons, the DC Suit has not been
                    deemed discontinued. As such, OS 495 for the return of the bank guarantee is
                    dismissed. In light of the conclusion reached above, there is no need to go
                    further to deal with LaserResearch’s submissions on O 21
                    r 2(6B).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Even if for the sake of argument O 21
                    r 2(6) applies, and the action has been deemed discontinued, Internech has
                    as an additional measure applied to reinstate the action (see Originating
                    Summons No 746 of 2010 (“OS 746”)). If it was necessary, I
                    would have allowed the application seeing that in this instance, especially
                    given the circumstances of the present case, <em>ie</em>,
                    the sole reason why no application for a order to stay the action or to extend
                    the stipulated period under O 21 r 2 was because Internech believed,
                    not unreasonably, that the automatic stay under s 299(2) of the Companies
                    Act was sufficient to render the automatic discontinuance provision inoperative.
                    In the circumstances, I make no order on the application in OS
                746.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For the reasons given above, I dismiss the
                    application in OS 495 with costs. I make no order on the application in OS 746
                    including costs.</p>
