In this regard, the perversity standard, as outlined in <span class="font-italic">Zhang Hong En Jonathan v Private Trustee in Bankruptcy of Zhang Hong’En Jonathan</span> [2021] 4 SLR 139 (“<span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span>”), should not apply. This is for two reasons: first, the application is sought pursuant to s 340 of the IRDA (as opposed to s 43 of the IRDA, which was the relevant provision in <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span>); and second, the determination of the monthly contribution and target contribution of a bankrupt is fundamental to when a bankrupt may be discharged from bankruptcy under the differentiated discharge regime. In the main, the Bankrupt submits that the PT failed to take into account relevant factors. The Bankrupt emphasises that he only earns $4,000 monthly and requires assistance from his friends and family to meet his monthly expenses. His earning capacity is also unlikely to increase. As for the payments made by the Bankrupt pre-bankruptcy, he asserts that these were funded by his companies, and are, in any event, irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the PT’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The PT maintains his determination of the Bankrupt’s monthly contribution and target contribution, which is based on the documents available to him at the point of determination.

Generally, a person other than the Official Assignee (also referred to as the private trustee), may be appointed as the trustee of a bankrupt’s estate: s 36 of the IRDA. When appointed, the private trustee steps into the shoes of the Official Assignee in administering the estate of the bankrupt, with the same functions and duties in relation to the conduct of the bankrupt in question and administration of the bankrupt’s estate: s 39(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. Barring the carve-out of certain provisions in the IRDA that directly pertain to the powers or duties of the Official Assignee, the private trustee is otherwise no different from the Official Assignee: ss 39(2) and 39(3) of the IRDA. Section 39(2), in fact, explicates that any references in the IRDA to the Official Assignee includes a reference to a trustee in bankruptcy. It is therefore unsurprising that the functions and duties of a private trustee are materially similar to that of the Official Assignee, that is, to supervise the conduct and affairs of the bankrupt and to administer the estate of the bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The first iteration of the provisions in Division 2 of Part 3 of the IRDA is found in the Bankruptcy Act 1995. Private trustees were introduced to the bankruptcy regime to encourage unsecured creditors to assume a more active role in bankruptcy proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(25 August 1994) vol 63 at col 402 (Prof S. Jayakumar, Minister for Law). It is notable that since the Bankruptcy Act 1995, the private trustee has had all the functions and duties of the Official Assignee in relation to the conduct of the bankrupt and the administration of the bankrupt’s estate: ss 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act 1995. Material amendments to the provisions concerning private trustees were then made by way of the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill in 2015 (“the Bill”), to require or incentivise institutional creditors to appoint private trustees to administer some bankruptcies. This was done with a view of ensuring a better utilisation of public resources, by having institutional creditors who have sufficient resources and expertise to make credit assessments to consider carefully whether to apply for a bankruptcy order: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(13 July 2015) vol 93 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Law). In the course of the Second Reading of the Bill, the role of the private trustee vis-à-vis that of the Official Assignee was explained by Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Law: regardless of whether the Official Assignee or a private trustee is appointed by the court, the same functions will be performed, that being, to administer the bankruptcy by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, investigating the bankrupt’s financial affairs to ascertain what is available for distribution. Since then, the provisions have been largely ported over from the Bankruptcy Act to the IRDA in their current form: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(1 September 2018) vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law). Consistently, the private trustee is envisaged to administer and supervise the affairs and the estate of the bankrupt, much like the Official Assignee. Nothing in the legislative history suggests otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Division 2 of Part 3 the IRDA, read alongside its legislative history, invariably suggests that the private trustee is entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the bankrupt. This is done with an eye towards both promoting recovery for the creditors and rehabilitating the credit of the bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 No specific duty, however, is owed to either the creditors or the bankrupt. As explained, the duty of the private trustee is no different from that of the Official Assignee, namely, to carry out the statutory obligations outlined in the IRDA. As for the supervision of the private trustee, this is largely left to the court. In doing so, the court would not generally interfere with the discretion exercised by the private trustee: for the private trustee to carry out his functions, the trustee must be empowered to act in respect of the bankruptcy estate and to exercise his own discretion. As succinctly explained by Harman J in <span class="font-italic">Re A Debtor (No 400 of 1940)</span><span class="font-italic">; Ex parte The Debtor v Dodwell</span> (<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Trustee) </span>[1949] 1 All ER 510 at 512, “[a]dministration in bankruptcy would be impossible if the trustee must answer at every step to the bankrupt for the exercise of his powers and discretions in the management and realisation of the property”, a view that this Court accepted at [42] of <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Lack of good faith or abuse of process would be reason to interfere, but the court would not readily find such being made out. Any bankrupt making such allegations should have good grounds in support, lest it be found that the bankrupt has himself committed abuse of process through making unwarranted allegations. Counsel putting forward such arguments on behalf of a bankrupt should be mindful of their instructions and would be expected to exercise their professional judgment and expertise in advising their bankrupt clients accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standard for review</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under the IRDA, s 43 establishes the general supervisory jurisdiction of the court over the acts, omissions or decisions of a private trustee.

Parties’ disagreement over the applicable standard for review concerns whether the perversity standard, as per <span class="font-italic">Jonathan </span><span class="font-italic">Zhang</span>, should apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Briefly, the perversity standard was held in <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang </span>to be the applicable standard of review in respect of s 43 of the IRDA. This Court found that it adequately balanced the considerations of, on one hand, the court having broad powers to disturb the private trustee’s decision and substitute its own, and on the other, to give the private trustee the control and management of the estate: <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span> at [42] and [43].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Bankrupt contends that the perversity standard is inapplicable as the application is made pursuant to s 340 of the IRDA.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This is unpersuasive. The application being made under s 340 of the IRDA does not detract from the supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the court over a private trustee via s 43 of the IRDA. The ordinary language of s 43 of the IRDA makes clear that it applies to all decisions of a private trustee. This is even more apparent when the section is viewed contextually. Section 43 is parked under Part 3, Division 2 of the IRDA which contains provisions that are of an overarching application to the private trustee. Even applying the interpretive principle that generally the specific provision excludes the general nothing in s 340 of the IRDA, either expressly or impliedly, suggests that a different standard from that in s 43 of the IRDA is required. Section 340 of the IRDA does not address the standard of review to be applied; it predominantly sets out the procedural steps involved in an application for review. Nothing in s 340 suggests that s 43 of the IRDA, and the standard it imports, is to be disapplied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 While the Bankrupt sought to distinguish the nature of the present review from other applications, in that the monthly contribution and target contribution affects the Bankrupt’s possible discharge from bankruptcy under the differentiated discharge framework, this should not be overstated. In <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span>, the bankrupt sought to impugn his private trustee’s decision to grant him sanction to defend a third-party action only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. The participation (or lack thereof) by the bankrupt in the third-party proceedings would have had a bearing on his estate, and consequently, on his discharge. Quite simply, most, if not all, of the decisions by a private trustee have a bearing on a bankrupt’s discharge, and it is an inadequate basis to suggest that a different standard should apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Given the above, the standard of review of the decisions of the private trustee would, I accept, be based on the perversity standard, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Jonathan</span><span class="font-italic"> Zhang</span>. The PT’s determination of monthly contribution and target contribution is a function of his business and commercial judgment. It is part and parcel of his administration of the Bankrupt’s estate. For the PT to do so effectively, he cannot be in a position where he is constantly looking over his back. This is consonant with the exposition of the role of the private trustee in the bankruptcy regime, as outlined above, and is further consistent with the court’s general reluctance to interfere too readily with the decisions of the private trustee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On the perversity standard, the question to be asked is if no other private trustee would have done what the Private Trustee has done; in other words, was the Private Trustee’s decision so absurd that no private trustee properly advised or properly instructing himself could have so acted: <span class="font-italic">Jonathan Zhang</span> at [31] and [46].

Moreover, the bank statements of Tera Realty Limited merely indicate a transfer of moneys to the Bankrupt, and do not show that moneys were used to repay the debts in the SOA.

</div> At its highest, Mr Loganathan’s affidavit merely confirms that he invested moneys into Tera Realty Limited but does little to cure the other defects of the Bankrupt’s claim: critically, it remains indeterminate if the moneys were used to repay the debts listed in the SOA. For context, all of this information was only provided in or after the Bankrupt’s fourth affidavit (dated 1 July 2022) in the present application. It is peculiar and puzzling that all of the above (including the allegation that the payment originated from a loan taken from Tera Realty Limited), which was well within the Bankrupt’s knowledge, was only first raised to the PT by way of his reply submissions dated 21 April 2022, with the relevant information being drip-fed to the PT via various affidavits and documents.

The PT thus assessed the Bankrupt’s financial situation with reference to that position.

</div> Full details of Mr Chua and Mr Tan’s assistance were only provided when the Bankrupt filed supplementary affidavits, when all this information was well within his possession previously.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Given the above, the assessment made by the PT was not so perverse that the Court should interfere. The PT’s determination was based on the information available to him at that point. His determinations were neither unreasonable nor objectionable. Documents that were subsequently provided were also done so in a haphazard manner, suggesting that the Bankrupt has failed to ensure complete and candid disclosure. There is no absurdity on the PT’s decision that requires intervention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 But given the information coming in such a way as was done here, I will direct the PT to require the Bankrupt to submit within three weeks all supplementary information (with all relevant documentation). This is to be consolidated in a single letter, and for the PT to thereafter conduct a final determination of the Bankrupt’s monthly contribution and target contribution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cost orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Directions for submissions on costs will be given separately.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For these reasons, the application is dismissed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Siraj Omar SC and Joelle Tan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Hui Li Debby and Cheng Si Yuan Shaun (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tito Shane Isaac, Wong Hui Min and Sindhu Nair (Tito Isaac &amp; Co LLP) for the private trustee.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
