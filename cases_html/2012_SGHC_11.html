<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Mdm Ong Lay Peng (“Mdm
                    Ong”), appealed against the decision of the Assistant Registrar
                    (“the AR”) regarding the damages awarded to the respondent,
                    Mr Menjit Singh s/o Hari Singh (“Mr Singh”), with
                    respect to the consequences of a whiplash suffered as a result of a relatively
                    minor accident (“the accident”) in a Housing and Development Board
                    car park (“the car park”) on 11 November 2006. Mr Singh,
                    who was a teacher and Head of the Humanities Department at the Holy
                    Innocents’ High School (“the school”) at the time of the
                    accident, had claimed that he was so physically disabled by the accident that he
                    could no longer work as a teacher even though there was ample evidence that he
                    was still fit enough to walk 3.2 km and could still drive his car and turn his
                    neck while reversing his car. The AR found that Mr Singh could in all
                    likelihood have continued his work as a teacher, with perhaps some adjustments
                    to his work environment. Despite this important finding, she upheld
                    Mr Singh’s claim for damages for loss of pre-trial and future
                    earnings as a teacher, which formed the bulk of the damages of more than $1m
                    claimed by the latter. Hence, Mdm Ong appealed against the AR’s decision
                    on the alleged loss of pre-trial and future earnings as a teacher.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At around 11 am on 11 November 2006,
                    Mr Singh reversed his vehicle bearing vehicle registration number SFS 9623Y
                    out of a parking lot in the car park. At the same time, Mdm Ong, who was looking
                    for a lot to park her vehicle bearing vehicle registration number SFT 8196P,
                    reversed her car at around 15 km per hour and hit the back of
                    Mr Singh’s car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       According to Mdm Ong, the accident was so minor
                    that her four year-old son, who was strapped to a child-seat in the rear
                    passenger seat, continued to play with his toy. However, Mr Singh, who
                    claimed that he suffered a whiplash as a result of the accident, did not return
                    to the school to teach and remained on medical leave for several months. More
                    than 8 months after the accident, he exhausted his medical leave on 19 July
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As Mr Singh continued to insist that he
                    could not work as a teacher, the Medical Board (“the Medical
                    Board”) of the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) met on
                    23 August 2007 to determine whether or not he was unfit to work as a
                    teacher. In a letter dated 13 November 2007, MOE informed him that the
                    Medical Board had found him unfit for further service as a Senior Education
                    Officer and that his last day of service was to be 12 December 2007. By
                    then, the Ministry of Education (“MOE”) had subsidised his medical
                    costs for a year and paid him his annual salary of around $113,000 while he
                    stayed at home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 10 March 2008, Mr Singh was
                    employed as a zone manager (special projects) at Educare Cooperative Ltd
                    (“Educare”), a Singapore Teachers’ Union co-operative. His
                    starting salary was $1,700 per month. On 1 April 2009, he was appointed the
                    head of Educare’s business development unit. To help him cope with his
                    work, Educare purchased a hands-free desk phone and adopted a sympathetic
                    approach to his need to go on medical leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 20 June 2008, more than six months after
                    leaving the service of MOE, Mr Singh commenced the present proceedings
                    against Mdm Ong. He claimed that the accident had caused him to suffer permanent
                    physical disability, especially to his neck, and that this affected his daily
                    life and prevented him from earning his pre-accident salary as a teacher and
                    Head of Department. He claimed $956,060 for loss of future earnings, $224,724
                    for loss of pre-trial earnings, and $91,080 for future medical and transport
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 14 January 2009, the parties agreed to
                    have interlocutory judgment entered against Mdm Ong, with her liability assessed
                    at 95%. The Court recorded a consent order which provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiff’s damages [are] to be assessed by the Registrar and
                        [the] parties hereto [are] at liberty to address the issue of causation in
                        relation to matters relevant to quantum of damages and the matters relevant
                        to quantum of damages include the scope of injuries, [the] issue of whether
                        the injuries were caused solely by the accident and financial losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Assessment of damages by the Assistant Registrar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Damages were assessed by the AR from 25 to
                    29 January 2010 and on 18 February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Singh called two expert witnesses to
                    testify on his behalf. The first, Dr Li Yung Hua
                    (“Dr Li”), an orthopaedic specialist from Orthopaedic
                    Associates, saw him on 48 occasions from 2007. The second expert witness,
                    Dr N Venketasubramaniam Ramani (“Dr Ramani”), a senior
                    consultant neurologist at the National University Hospital, saw him on 11
                    occasions from 2007. Mdm Ong called one expert witness, namely Dr Chang Wei
                    Chun, (“Dr Chang”), an orthopaedic surgeon from Orthopaedic
                    &amp; Traumatic Surgery Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Video tapes of Mr Singh’s daily
                    activities (“the video tapes”) over a period of time were
                    furnished to the AR by two of Mdm Ong’s insurers’ private
                    investigators, Simmon Security &amp; Investigation Services Pte Ltd
                    (“Simmon”) and Sterling Response Pte Ltd
                    (“Sterling”). The video tapes showed that contrary to the picture
                    painted by Mr Singh about his disabilities, he was able to walk more than 3
                    km at a time, move his neck up and down, and drive and reverse his car without
                    apparent difficulty. After viewing the video tapes, the AR concluded that
                    Mr Singh seemed “perfectly capable of going about his activities of
                    daily living” and “did not seem to exhibit any debilitating
                    stiffness or pain in the neck or shoulder region”. More importantly, she
                    stated that Mr Singh would in all likelihood have been able to continue his
                    work as a teacher or Head of Department, with perhaps some modification in his
                    work environment and habits. She mentioned that he could take more frequent
                    breaks and have his computer equipment adjusted. Despite finding that
                    Mr Singh could continue to work as a teacher, the AR awarded him damages
                    for loss of pre-trial and future earnings on the basis that he was permanently
                    disabled from earning his pre-accident salary as a teacher and Head of
                    Department.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The AR held that Mr Singh’s loss of
                    pre-trial earnings amounted to $233,855. For the purpose of assessing
                    Mr Singh’s loss of future earnings, the AR accepted that he would
                    have worked from the age of 46 until the age of 62. She adopted a multiplier of
                    7 and a multiplicand of $84,590. As such, loss of future earnings was quantified
                    at $592,130. The specific amounts awarded by the AR as damages were as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After taking into account
                    Mr Singh’s liability for 5%, the AR held that he was entitled to
                    $873,035.75.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Scope of Mdm Ong’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There are two aspects to Mr Singh’s
                    claim for damages for personal injury resulting from the accident. The first
                    concerns the whiplash suffered by him. A whiplash, which is often associated
                    with motor accidents, arises from a sudden and abnormal force applied to the
                    neck that causes it to move beyond its normal range of movement. It causes soft
                    tissue neck injury. In regard to this injury, Mr Singh was awarded $12,000
                    for pain and suffering and $21,000 as special damages. Mdm Ong did not appeal
                    against these awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The second aspect of Mr Singh’s
                    alleged injury, which is the subject matter of the appeal, concerns
                    “whiplash injury”. While people usually recover from a whiplash,
                    some accident victims complain of continuing headaches, pain in the neck,
                    tingling in the arms, dizziness, lumbar pains and fatigue. Mr Singh claimed
                    to be suffering from such chronic whiplash injury and that this prevented him
                    from continuing to work as a teacher. Mdm Ong contended that Mr Singh
                    should not have been awarded damages for loss of pre-trial and future earnings
                    as he could have continued to work as a teacher if he had wanted
                to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As the parties amicably settled their dispute
                    on the award of $60,000 for the cost of future medical care and transport and
                    Mdm Ong did not appeal against the award of damages for pain and suffering
                    ($12,000) or special damages ($21,000), the only issue before this court was
                    whether or not Mr Singh was entitled to damages for loss of pre-trial and
                    future earnings. Much depended on whether Mr Singh suffers from whiplash
                    injury and if he does, whether or not the pain and discomfort prevented him from
                    working as a teacher or Head of Department.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In a claim for damages for personal injuries,
                    the general rule is that the plaintiff has to prove the damage he claims to have
                    suffered as a result of the defendant’s actions and the so-called
                    “but for” test is applicable. In <em>Sunny Metal
                        &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<em>Sunny
                        Metal”)</em>, V K Rajah JA explained (at [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the determination of whether a defendant's wrongful conduct is a cause
                            <em>in fact</em> of the damage to a claimant, the
                        test, which has almost universal acceptance, is the so-called "but for"
                        test.... In other words, one should, in order to determine whether an act or
                        omission was a cause of the loss, eliminate the act or omission mentally and
                        consider whether or not the loss would still have occurred. If the loss
                        would not have occurred when the act or omission is eliminated, the act or
                        omission is a <em>condicio sine qua non</em> for the
                        loss. If the loss would still have occurred, even when the act or omission
                        in question is disregarded, the loss has not been caused by this act or
                        omission.... However, even if the test yields a positive answer, <em>ie</em>, the loss would not have occurred but for the
                        defendant's act or omission, it merely qualifies the act or omission as a
                        possible, though by no means necessarily, sufficient cause for legal
                        purposes.... [T]his act or omission must then be regarded as the cause
                            <em>in law</em> and then pass an additional test of
                        remoteness. In other words, "but for" is a necessary but not a sufficient
                        condition of legal responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The “but for” test has its
                    limitations and may not always produce a fair result. In <em>Sunny Metal</em>, V K Rajah JA referred to the inadequacy of this
                    test (at [69]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, it has been said by many that the "but for" test is,
                        in some circumstances, insufficient to lead to a just result. McLachlin J of
                        the Canadian Supreme Court, writing extra-judicially in "Negligence Law -
                        Proving the Connection" (in <em>Torts Tomorrow: A Tribute to
                            John Fleming</em> (Nicholas J Mullany &amp; Allen M Linden eds)
                        (LBC Information Services, 1998) pp 16-35), has pointed out (at
                        p 18) that the problem is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[S]ometimes when the answer to the but-for test is negative, the
                            circumstances nonetheless cry out that the defendant was a cause of the
                            plaintiff's injuries and must be held liable. There is a tension between
                            the traditional but-for, all-or-nothing, approach to cause-in-fact and
                            the need to compensate persons who are likely victims of wrongful
                            conduct, but who would be denied recovery under the traditional
                            test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">McLachlin J then goes on to list three situations in which the "but for"
                        test is "troublesome", <em>viz</em>, in (a)
                        indeterminate defendant cases; (b) indeterminate claimant cases and (c)
                        indeterminate harm cases. For indeterminate defendant cases, the claimant
                        has been tortiously injured, but it is not clear who, among a group of
                        potential tortfeasors, was the cause in fact of the loss. As for the
                        indeterminate claimant cases, the defendant has engaged in tortious conduct
                        which has caused loss to a number of persons, but it is not clear whether
                        the claimant belongs to the group of persons injured by the defendant's
                        conduct. Finally, in respect of the indeterminate harm cases, a defendant
                        has engaged in tortious conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                        claimant, but it is not clear whether the defendant's conduct actually
                        caused harm to the claimant. All that can be said is that the defendant's
                        conduct increased the risk of harm in that the claimant lost a chance of
                        avoiding harm or of achieving a better result. These problems with the "but
                        for" test were also recognised by this court in <em>The
                            Cherry</em> (at [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Where the “but for” test does
                    not produce a just result, other approaches are available. One approach noted in
                        <em>Sunny Metal</em> (at [73]) concerns the burden of
                    proof. In appropriate cases, the court may adopt a commonsensical approach to
                    causation and “although the burden of proving cause in fact is not
                    reversed and no actual presumption of causation is created, an inference of
                    causation may be drawn even in the absence of affirmative scientific evidence of
                    causation, or where the claimant's evidence of causation is minimal”
                        (<em>Sunny Metal</em> at [73]). Another approach
                    referred to in <em>Sunny Metal</em> (at [74]) relates to a
                    loss of chance, which requires the causal link to be viewed on the basis of
                    proportionate loss and the plaintiff’s damage is “effectively
                    re-categorised as the <em>chance</em> of obtaining a
                    benefit or avoiding a loss, rather than the loss itself” [emphasis in
                    original].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Singh’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In an attempt to bolster his case that his
                    chronic whiplash injury was caused by the accident, Mr Singh asserted as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_i"></a>(i)     Mdm Ong’s car was moving at a
                        high speed when the accident occurred and that his car was badly damaged in
                        the accident;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     His car was badly damaged as a result of the accident;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     He had
                        suffered from 23 symptoms (“the 23 symptoms”) of whiplash
                        injury, and he had consulted Dr Li and Dr Ramani on all these
                        symptoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As for whether Mdm Ong was driving her car at
                    a high speed at the time of the accident, Mr Singh admitted that he knew
                    that the speed at which the two vehicles collided was an important factor for
                    determining the impact of the collision as well the extent of his injuries.
                    Despite this, when he went to the Independent Damage Assessment Centre
                    (“IDAC”) on the day of the accident to file a report (“the
                    IDAC report”), he did not state that Mdm Ong had reversed her car at a
                    high speed. In fact, he had agreed all along that Mdm Ong’s car was moving
                    at only “about 15 to 20 km” per hour when the accident occurred.
                    Furthermore, if Mdm Ong had reversed her car at a high speed, Mr Singh
                    could have suffered some injury apart from the whiplash. Although he testified
                    that he knew that he was required to lodge a police report if he had suffered
                    even a slight injury in the accident, he stated in the IDAC report that he had
                    no injuries and he did not lodge any police report on the day of the accident.
                    He was not unfamiliar with an IDAC report because in his IDAC report in relation
                    to an earlier accident in November 2004 (“the 2004 accident”), he
                    stated that he had been injured in that earlier accident. I thus agree with Mdm
                    Ong’s counsel that Mr Singh’s assertion that she had reversed
                    her car at a high speed was unfounded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As for the alleged damage to
                    Mr Singh’s car, the photographs produced by the workshop showed that
                    the car had only been slightly damaged. Mr Singh conceded that he did not
                    mention in his affidavit for the assessment of damages that his car had been
                    badly damaged. More importantly, when cross-examined, he finally admitted that
                    the only problem he had with his car after the accident was that he had some
                    difficulty opening the car boot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Singh’s evidence in relation to
                    the speed at which Mdm Ong reversed her car before his car was hit and the
                    alleged severe damage to his car showed that he was quite prone to exaggeration
                    and this was confirmed by his evidence in relation to the 23 symptoms.
                    Mr Singh claimed to have suffered from the following symptoms of whiplash
                    injury:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)     Pain in the neck commencing as mild
                        pain initially after the accident becoming severe the next

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Recurring shooting pain from his neck to his left arm and into the fingers
                        of his left hand between 19 and 21 November 2006 when he was
                        hospitalised.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     The shooting pain radiated to his right arm after a few months around March

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_ix"></a>(ix)     Recurring giddiness beginning in December

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_xv"></a>(xv)     A feeling like his neck was getting locked
                        starting in November 2006.</p>

                        fingers when he tilts his head backwards or even when he rests on a couch,

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_xxiii"></a>(xxiii)    Inability to concentrate starting around April or May
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mdm Ong’s counsel, Mr Vinodh
                    Coomaraswamy SC (“Mr Coomaraswamy”), wryly observed that
                    Mr Singh had looked at the entire list of possible symptoms of chronic
                    whiplash injury and claimed all of them as his own in his attempt to claim a
                    massive amount of damages for the consequences of a minor
                accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Singh claimed that he had related the
                    23 symptoms to his doctors, including Dr Li and Dr Ramani, as soon as
                    he began to notice them. He added that all 23 symptoms had manifested themselves
                    by the time Dr Li wrote his latest report. However, in that report,
                    Dr Li only referred to Mr Singh’s neck ache, shoulder pain and
                    headaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr Li’s evidence on the 23 symptoms
                    contradicted Mr Singh’s testimony. When cross-examined on why he had
                    not recorded many of the symptoms Mr Singh claimed to be suffering from,
                    Dr Li said that he only recorded orthopaedic symptoms. Subsequently, he
                    mentioned that Mr Singh did complain to him about numbness in the fingers
                    and weakness in the right hand but he did not record these because he
                    “did not find any objective loss of sensation” in the fingers or
                    “objective weakness” in the hand. Dr Li added that
                    Mr Singh had complained to him about numbness in the right cheek but he
                    referred this to Dr Ramani, who is a neurologist, to treat this condition.
                    Even if the additional evidence of Dr Li is taken into account, the fact
                    remains that Mr Singh did not consult him on quite a number of the 23
                    symptoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As for Dr Ramani, who treated
                    Mr Singh’s neurological problems, he mentioned symptoms such as neck
                    pain, finger numbness and headaches in his report on 4 April 2008 and left
                    out many of the 23 symptoms. However, he testified that Mr Singh had also
                    complained to him about giddiness, numbness and pain along the right jaw and
                    difficulty in lifting heavy objects or sitting for too long. All the same, the
                    fact remains that Dr Ramani did not see it fit to record these additional
                    problems in his report and he testified that he could not recall that
                    Mr Singh had complained to him about difficulty in squatting and sitting
                    down to pray. Furthermore, he could see nothing in his medical notes about
                    Mr Singh’s anxiety, sadness or difficulty in sleeping, all of which
                    were part of the 23 symptoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     When cross-examined, Mr Singh claimed
                    that while he had noticed the omission of many of his symptoms in
                    Dr Li’s report, he did not point this out to Dr Li or his
                    lawyers because he respected Dr Li. However, the inescapable conclusion was
                    that contrary to Mr Singh’s testimony that he had consulted his
                    doctors on all the 23 symptoms, quite a number of them had never been disclosed
                    to his doctors. This unnecessary attempt to bolster his claim for damages, as
                    well as his assertion that he was involved in a high-speed accident and that his
                    car was badly damaged in the accident, dented his credibility and made it
                    necessary to ask whether any possible exaggeration by him of his pain and
                    discomfort was taken into account by his doctors. After all, neck and shoulder
                    pains are not uncommon problems and there is justifiable concern that some
                    accident victims may exaggerate their neck and shoulder pains to make exorbitant
                    claims against insurers on the basis of whiplash injury. It was thus not too
                    much to expect Mr Singh’s doctors to conduct objective tests to
                    verify his claims of pain and discomfort before coming to the conclusion that he
                    deserved such prolonged medical leave as well as a medical assessment that he
                    could no longer work as a teacher.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The medical experts’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Singh’s expert witness,
                    Dr Li, who has had 15 years of experience as an orthopaedic specialist, was
                    quite aware of the need to conduct objective tests to verify
                    Mr Singh’s claims of pain and discomfort. After all, he was aware of
                    the biopsychosocial model of chronic whiplash injury (“the
                    biopsychosocial model”), in respect of which there is much medical
                    literature. This model suggests that the development of chronic symptoms after a
                    whiplash incident may be linked to psychological, cultural and social factors.
                    Apparently, in countries where the general population has very little knowledge
                    or expectation of chronic whiplash injury, the incidence of whiplash injury is
                    very low. However, where information on the potential for chronic pain after a
                    whiplash is widely available, the expectation of future chronic pain by some
                    accident victims may lead them to become hyper-vigilant for symptoms and to
                    regard some normal bodily sensations as abnormal or alarming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     When cross-examined on the biopsychosocial

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Coomaraswamy submitted that
                    Mr Singh’s complaints of chronic whiplash injury may be accounted for
                    by the biopsychosocial model. He pointed out Mr Singh’s family
                    doctor, Dr Wilmot Rasanayagam (“Dr Wilmot”), had
                    testified that he was “the type of chap who’s very – very,
                    very curious about his health”. He also noted that Mr Singh had
                    testified that he had done research on the consequences of a whiplash incident
                    and had been told by others, including his sister, a nursing officer, that the
                    pain could be very severe for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Dr Chang took the view that the severity
                    and range of the symptoms allegedly suffered by Mr Singh were
                    psychologically caused and/or were due to his personal psychological
                    magnification of his symptoms. Significantly, Dr Li agreed that there was
                    some evidence that Mr Singh’s case falls within the biopsychosocial
                    model and that the latter had exaggerated his symptoms by 30%. When
                    cross-examined, Dr Li stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Do you consider his pain and his whiplash to fall
                            within what was described as the biopsychosocial model [of] chronic
                            whiplash?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>I think he does have some
                                evidence of that.</em> A person with chronic pain syndrome
                            tends to have also some psychological inference into it, which sometimes
                            cause a little bit of magnification. But to some extent <em>I believe he has both</em>, which is very difficult
                            to distinguish what is the component, but <em>I think the
                                genuine part is probably may be 70 per cent</em> and then
                                <em>another 30 per cent is probably affected by his

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I agree with the AR’s conclusion that
                    Mr Singh’s symptoms were “likely to [have been] magnified by
                    the biopsychosocial model of chronic whiplash”. The question which arises
                    is whether Mr Singh’s doctors had sufficiently checked whether
                    Mr Singh’s complaints of pain and discomfort were genuine or
                    exaggerated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of objective medical tests by Dr Li and

                    Mr Singh for several months after the accident, agreed that he owed a duty
                    to the latter’s employer to make sure that the prolonged medical leave was
                    justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What a patient tells his doctor is of course
                    the starting point for the latter’s diagnosis. However, bearing in mind
                    that Dr Li thought that Mr Singh had exaggerated his symptoms by 30%
                    (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>, above), it was rather disturbing
                    that he relied primarily on the latter’s description of symptoms when he
                    decided to grant the latter medical leave for such a long time.
                    Dr Li’s following answers during cross-examination showed just how
                    much he relied on Mr Singh’s words:</p>

                    biopsychosocial model of whiplash syndrome. While there may be other ways to
                    objectively assess Mr Singh’s condition, the fact remains that
                    Dr Ramani relied primarily on Mr Singh’s description of his pain
                    and discomfort for his diagnosis. In the light of Dr Li’s admission
                    that he had not “followed good practice” when he did not compute a
                    current Visual Analogue Scale and Neck Disability Index, Dr Ramani must
                    also be faulted for not relying on these tests or other objective tests for his
                    diagnosis of Mr Singh’s condition. In any case, Dr Ramani, who
                    said that his approach to whiplash was primarily from a neurological
                    perspective, testified more than once that where his diagnosis differed from
                    that of Dr Li, he would defer to the latter who, being an orthopaedic
                    specialist, was in a better position to diagnose Mr Singh’s
                    condition. Admittedly, Dr Ramani subsequently wanted an opportunity to
                    “rethink” and “revise” his previous responses where
                    he had agreed to defer to Dr Li. However, Mr Coomarawamy rightly
                    pointed out that “defer” is an ordinary word which Dr Ramani
                    understood perfectly and that the latter was in fact trying to change his
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Unlike Dr Li and Dr Ramani,
                    Dr Chang, who has had 34 years of experience in the field of orthopaedic
                    and trauma surgery, was convinced that Mr Singh had faked his neck
                    immobility and part of his discomfort and pain. Dr Chang, who examined
                    Mr Singh and studied his medical records as well as the private
                    investigators’ surveillance reports and video tapes, asserted that when he
                    examined Mr Singh on 24 March 2009, the latter had deliberately
                    refused to move his neck. He deduced that Mr Singh’s alleged neck
                    immobility was feigned for a number of reasons. First, Mr Singh held his
                    neck in a stiff position although there was no muscle spasm. While Dr Chang
                    conceded that a surgeon cannot tell from a physical examination whether or not a
                    spasm is genuine, he had called for an x-ray to confirm his diagnosis. Secondly,
                    Mr Singh’s x-ray results on the same day revealed a normal curvature
                    in his spine, which was inconsistent with his physical display of stiffness.
                    Thirdly, a person with severe pain in the neck can usually move a few degrees
                    but Mr Singh “absolutely” refused to move his neck. Finally,
                    it appeared from the private investigators’ video tapes that after leaving
                    his clinic on 24 March 2009, Mr Singh was far more mobile than he had
                    claimed to be during the medical examination at his clinic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Apart from not conducting sufficient objective
                    tests to determine Mr Singh’s true condition, the credibility of
                    Dr Li’s diagnosis was affected when he withdrew his original
                    diagnosis of the former’s cervical spondylosis, which could give rise to
                    many of the symptoms in question. Dr Li had initially taken the position
                    that the accident had caused Mr Singh to have a disc bulge, which is an
                    aspect of cervical spondylosis, and stenosis, which is an abnormal narrowing of
                    the spinal canal. Symptoms of stenosis include pain in the neck or back,
                    numbness as well as weakness or pain in the arms, all of which were included in
                    Mr Singh’s complaints about his condition. He informed
                    Mr Singh’s lawyers about this diagnosis. However, when
                    cross-examined, Dr Li contradicted what he had told Mr Singh’s
                    lawyers and agreed that his advice that the accident had caused the cervical
                    spondylosis was wrong. The relevant part of the proceedings is as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Dr Chang, who noted that
                    Mr Singh’s cervical spondylosis was not uncommonly seen in the
                    latter’s age group, stated that there was “clear-cut evidence of
                    degenerative changes of [Mr Singh’s] spine”. He explained that
                    Mr Singh’s disc bulge was caused by degenerative process rather than
                    by trauma during the accident. When cross-examined, he testified that if the
                    disc problem had been caused by the accident, one would see a herniated disc
                    instead. He added that a disc bulge, which is secondary to a degenerative disc
                    disease, arises when the disc bulges out of a weak wall. In contrast, a
                    “herniated disc”, which can be caused by the degenerative process
                    as well as trauma, refers to a situation in which the discrete disc material
                    comes through the annulus in a discrete manner and compresses on a
                nerve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Whatever may have been the cause of
                    Mr Singh’s cervical spondylosis and stenosis, Dr Li’s
                    change of position on this matter would have been unnecessary if he had not
                    given the wrong medical opinion to Mr Singh’s lawyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     When considering Dr Li’s diagnosis
                    of Mr Singh’s neck problems, it must be borne in mind that he had
                    assumed that the latter had not complained about neck pain prior to the accident
                    in 2006. However, the truth was that Mr Singh had been involved in a
                    similar accident in 2004 and he had stated in his IDAC report on 22 July
                    2004 (“the 2004 IDAC report”) that he suffered from head and neck
                    pain. This fact was not disclosed to Dr Li. In fact, the 2004 IDAC report
                    was only disclosed on 21 January 2010, four days before the hearing on the
                    assessment of damages commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     When cross-examined, Mr Singh agreed that
                    the 2004 accident was “almost exactly the same as what happened in
                    November 2006” in that his car was hit from the rear at about the same
                    speed. Dr Li testified that if he had known about the 2004 accident, it
                    would have been relevant to his consideration of Mr Singh’s
                    condition. He also agreed that if Mr Singh had complained of neck pain
                    after the accident in 2004, that pain would be regarded as a whiplash injury.
                    Most important of all, he accepted that if a person in a car had been struck
                    from behind by another car in July 2004, it is quite possible that what he
                    claims to be experiencing now could be due to that earlier accident. On this
                    point, he testified as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So somebody could have a whiplash injury, say, in
                            July 2004, ... and then show symptoms only in 2007; is that
                            right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Maybe even 10 years down the road.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     To sum up, I preferred the evidence of
                    Dr Chang, which is that while he does have residual neckache and stiffness
                    from the accident, he was not as debilitated as he claimed to be as a result of
                    the accident. The next question to be considered is whether
                    Mr Singh’s medical condition after the accident, shorn of his
                    exaggerations, affected his ability to teach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mr Singh’s pain and discomfort affected his
                ability to teach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is one thing for a doctor to say that his
                    patient suffers from neck and shoulder pain and another to say that the patient
                    suffers from so much neck and shoulder pain that he can no longer teach. As
                    Mr Singh did not return to the school to teach after the accident in
                    November 2006, how did Dr Li and Dr Ramani conclude that Mr Singh
                    could no longer teach?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Surprisingly, Dr Ramani testified that he
                    could not recall ever having spoken to Mr Singh about returning to work as
                    a teacher. As for Dr Li, he testified that he had assumed that
                    Mr Singh had gone back to work while the latter was on medical leave and
                    had found it difficult to cope with his work. This was a false and fundamental
                    assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Dr Li admitted that the “only
                    basis” for his conclusion that Mr Singh could no longer work as a
                    teacher was that he accepted at face value what Mr Singh told him. When
                    cross-examined, he stated as follows:</p>

                    had tailed Mr Singh for many days and their video tapes shed some light on

                    the hearing of the appeal, I viewed the video tapes. I noticed that while there
                    were a few occasions when Mr Singh was seen rubbing his neck for a little
                    while, he appeared to have handled his daily activities, including walking for
                    hours at a time and driving and reversing his car, quite well. It appeared from
                    the video tapes that Mr Singh had exaggerated his pain and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As I have found that Mr Singh had
                    exaggerated his symptoms and could have continued to work as a teacher, what he
                    told the Medical Board about his medical condition was not a true picture of his
                    symptoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The views of Dr Li and Dr Ramani
                    were relevant to the deliberations of the Medical Board. Dr Li submitted
                    reports on Mr Singh’s condition to MOE while Dr Ramani was one
                    of two members of the said Board. When cross-examined on why he thought in
                    August 2007 that Mr Singh was still unlikely to be able to return to the
                    school to teach, Dr Ramani showed just how much his opinion was based on
                    what Mr Singh himself said when he testified as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">.... My question is: in August 2007, what was the
                            basis for you to think that he was still unlikely to return to his
                            previous job, when he hadn’t been required to perform those duties
                            in the entire intervening period?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did record here on 21 August 2007 that he was

                            up and down comfortably because of the stiff neck and the pain in his
                            neck, headache and giddiness were there, and couldn’t lift
                            objects, even notebooks, and couldn’t sit for too

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As has been mentioned, the failure of
                    Dr Ramani and Dr Li to satisfy the court that Mr Singh was
                    permanently disabled from working as a teacher undermined Mr Singh’s
                    claim for damages for loss of pre-trial and future earnings. As the Medical
                    Board’s decision was based on the same defects as the evidence of
                    Dr Ramani, Dr Li and Mr Singh at the hearing on assessment of
                    damages, I hold that the said decision does not stand in the way of a finding
                    that Mr Singh could have returned to work as a teacher before he was
                    medically boarded out by the MOE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<b><em>Conclusion on Mr Singh’s
                    condition</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     A victim who suffers from chronic whiplash
                    injury after a motor accident should be awarded an appropriate amount of damages
                    for the injury. However, as chronic whiplash injury can be easily faked, there
                    must be adequate proof of such an injury. Where possible, objective medical
                    tests must be conducted by the doctor to test the veracity of an accident
                    victim’s complaint of chronic whiplash injury. A doctor should not rely
                    primarily on what an accident victim claims are his symptoms of chronic whiplash
                    injury to form an opinion that the victim can no longer work. Otherwise, the
                    door will be open to anyone involved in a minor accident to mount frivolous
                    claims for damages for such an injury, and especially so when many people who
                    have not been involved in road accidents also suffer from neck and shoulder
                    pain, which are two of Mr Singh’s main complaints. If caution is not
                    exercised, the general public will have to bear the burden of higher premiums on
                    their motor insurance policies. In <em>Heil v Rankin and another
                        and other appeals</em> [2001] 1 QB 272, Lord Woolf MR (at
                        [35]) referred to <em>Wise v Kaye</em> [1962] 1 QB 638 at 669-670, where Diplock
                    LJ stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]nsurance removes the immediate burden of paying damages from the
                        individual defendants and spreads it ultimately over the general body of
                        premium-paying policy-holders. Here it increases in most cases the general
                        cost of goods and services, in some cases merely the cost of private
                        motoring, with consequent hardship to the public as a whole. To avoid fixing
                        the scale at a level which would materially affect the cost of living or
                        disturb the current social pattern is a factor, Benthamite no doubt in
                        origin, in the empirical process by which the maximum/datum is
                        determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the present case, Dr Li and
                    Dr Ramani relied primarily on what Mr Singh had told them about his
                    alleged symptoms and did not do enough to verify Mr Singh’s claims.
                    After taking all circumstances into account, I accept Dr Chang’s
                    evidence that while Mr Singh suffers from a residual neckache and stiffness
                    from the accident, it is “highly unlikely that the symptoms were so
                    severe that he is unable to continue his previous job as a teacher and Head of
                    Department”. In view of this, I hold that that it was not proven that
                    Mr Singh suffered from such chronic and permanent disability as a result of
                    the accident that he could not continue to work as a teacher or Head of
                    Department.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damages for loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As it was not established that Mr Singh
                    could no longer work as a teacher or Head of Department as a result of the
                    accident, the question of an award of damages for loss of earnings does not
                    arise and the AR’s award for loss of pre-trial and future earnings is set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     A question arises as to whether an award of
                    damages for loss of earning capacity is appropriate. Such an award is made to a
                    plaintiff whose chances in the future of getting work as well paid as before the
                    accident have been lessened by the injury. In <em>Fairley v John
                        Thompson (Design and Contracting Division) Ltd</em> [1973] 2 Lloyd's
                    Rep 40, Lord Denning MR made it clear (at 42) that while compensation for loss
                    of future earnings is awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence,
                    compensation for diminution in earning capacity is awarded as part of general
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel v
                        Shaw Linda Gillian</em> [2010] 3 SLR 587, the Court of
                    Appeal stated (at [36]) that “[i]t is
                    trite that an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the
                    plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded <em>if there
                        is a substantial or real risk</em> that the plaintiff could lose his
                    or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working
                    life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage
                    in the open employment market” (emphasis in original). In the present
                    case, there was no basis for an award for loss of earning capacity. Apart from
                    the fact that there was insufficient evidence that Mr Singh could not teach
                    or that there was a substantial or real risk of losing his teaching appointment
                    had he not decided to stay away from the school for such a prolonged period,
                    there was also no evidence before the court that there was a substantial or real
                    risk that he would lose his present job. Mr Singh confirmed that his
                    present employer is “sympathetic and understanding”. In view of
                    this, the question of damages for loss of earning capacity need not be further
                    considered.</p>
