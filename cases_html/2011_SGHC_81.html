<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involves a dispute between siblings
                    over the ownership of a property at People’s Park Complex (“the
                    Property”). The Property was registered solely in the name of the
                    defendant, the sister. There is, however, no dispute that the bulk of the
                    purchase price for the Property, some 85%, was funded by her two brothers, the
                    plaintiffs. The parties were at loggerheads whether the funding by the
                    plaintiffs was by way of “friendly loans” or as a co-investment in
                    the Property. However, if they were loans as alleged by the defendant, based on
                    the monthly repayment to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff from the
                    distribution of the rental income earned from the Property, it would take the
                    defendant almost thirty years to repay the “friendly loan” to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After the purchase of the Property, the
                    defendant wrote to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to suggest that
                    they buy “one <em>more</em> PPK complex
                    unit”. In her effort to persuade the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    plaintiff to purchase another unit at People’s Park Complex
                    (“PPK”) with her, the defendant assured the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff that she would not cheat him or
                        “<em>makan the hse [sic] for
                    herself</em>”. Ironically the plaintiffs’ worst fears were
                    confirmed when the defendant refused to recognise their respective shares in the
                    Property and sought to claim the Property for herself thereby necessitating the
                    commencement of the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       When it became clear that the defendant’s
                    “loan” case theory was tenuous, she resorted to rely on the
                    defence of illegality to preclude the plaintiffs from claiming their
                    proportionate shares in the Property. Not only was this defence not pleaded,
                    which is not necessarily a bar in itself, a review of the relevant cases exposed
                    the defence to be devoid of any merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs’ claim is for a declaration
                    that the Property is held by the defendant in resulting trust for the benefit of
                    the plaintiffs and the defendant in proportion to each party’s direct
                    capital contributions and that the Property be sold and proceeds divided
                    according to the parties’ respective shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The purchase price of the Property was
                    $320,000.00. There is no dispute that the plaintiffs contributed an aggregate
                    sum of $285,436.04 towards the purchase price of the Property (“the
                    Sums”). Specifically, the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff paid
                    $3,200.00 as the initial option fee of 1%. The balance deposit of 9%
                    ($28,800.00) was paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. At
                    completion, the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff paid further amounts of $126,200.00
                    and $127,236.04 respectively. In contrast, the defendant contributed only a
                    total sum of $50,000.00 towards the purchase price of the Property. However
                    notwithstanding the plaintiffs’ respective contributions, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    plaintiffs agreed between themselves (settling their own accounts <em>vis-a-vis</em> each other) that their respective shares in
                    the Property were 64.1% and 20.3% instead. The defendant’s contribution
                    was 15.6% ($50,000 of $320,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       However, the parties offered very different
                    versions as regards the purpose for the payments of the Sums. The
                    plaintiffs’ case is that the purchase of the Property was a co-investment
                    by all parties and that the Sums constituted their contributions to that
                    investment. In contrast, the defendant argued that the Sums were simply loans,
                    “repayable on demand”, which were advanced to her by the
                    plaintiffs, as her brothers, to enable her to purchase the
                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Neither the co-investment nor the loan was
                    documented in any formal agreement. After the purchase of the Property was
                    completed, two documents were prepared in connection with the Property. First, a
                    Power of Attorney dated 27 November 2005 (“POA”) was executed by
                    the defendant in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs. Under the POA, the plaintiffs
                    were empowered by the defendant to carry out various acts on behalf of the
                    defendant in relation to the Property including, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, collection of rent, granting of leases and tenancies,
                    payment of taxes, rates, charges and other outgoings and instituting legal
                    proceedings to recover possession of the Property. In executing the POA on
                    29 November 2005, the defendant added the words “for purpose of
                    collecting rent &amp; tenancy” in her own handwriting next to her
                    signature. Second, a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) was
                    prepared by the plaintiffs which was allegedly to be executed by all parties to
                    reflect the proper percentages and other terms of the co-investment to avoid any
                    future dispute. According to the plaintiffs, the MOU was allegedly forwarded to
                    the defendant in December 2005, a claim which the defendant denied. She alleged
                    that the first time she received the MOU was on 14 November 2008 at the
                    office of the plaintiffs’ solicitor but she refused to sign the MOU
                    because she did not agree with its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There are two main issues before this
                    Court:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the Sums were disbursed as the
                            plaintiffs’ contributions as co-investment in the Property or as
                            loans to the defendant; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">if the Sums were disbursed as the
                            plaintiffs’ contributions to the co-investment, whether the
                            doctrine of illegality operates to rebut the resulting trust in favour
                            of the plaintiffs.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I will deal with each issue in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The purpose for which the Sums were disbursed </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before I begin my evaluation of the evidence as
                    to whether the Sums were disbursed as the plaintiffs’ contributions to the
                    co-investment in the Property or as loans to the defendant, it is important to
                    highlight that there is no halfway house between the two competing case
                    theories. If I find that the Sums were not loans, then it must follow that they
                    were instead the plaintiffs’ contributions as co-investment in the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant sought to rely on the following
                    to either prove the loans or to disprove the alleged co-investment with the
                    plaintiffs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiffs did not inform the
                        solicitor who was engaged to handle the purchase of the Property of any
                        trust arrangements in relation to the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The unchallenged evidence of the
                        defendant’s daughter that the defendant had told the plaintiffs at a
                        meeting in the plaintiffs’ solicitor’s office on
                        14 November 2008 that the draft MOU to reflect the proper percentages
                        of the parties and other terms of the co-investment was not previously
                        provided to the defendant as alleged by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The POA dated 27 November 2005
                        supports the defendant’s case that she had executed the POA in favour
                        of the plaintiffs merely to allow either of them to collect the monthly
                        rents from the tenant(s) directly, deduct the respective sums of $1,147.00
                        and $358.00 in accordance with the monthly instalment plan (being repayments
                        of the respective loans to the plaintiffs) and for reimbursement of
                        outgoings, before paying the balance amounts over to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While it is true that none of the above proved
                    that the Property was a co-investment by the parties, it is equally true that
                    they do not inexorably establish that the monies were advanced as loans for the
                    purchase of the Property. Therefore, even if the defendant’s arguments are
                    taken at its highest, it is clear that they are, at best, neutral with respect
                    to either of the case theories put forward by the plaintiffs and the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>Sums entirely consistent with
                        co-investment</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Having reviewed the evidence before me, I find
                    that the Sums were disbursed by the plaintiffs as their contributions to the
                    co-investment in the Property and not as loans to the defendant. There is a
                    multitude of reasons to support this finding, to which I elaborate below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, I accept the evidence of the
                        plaintiffs that the agent for the Property, Ms Koo Suit Har
                        (“Ms Koo”), was appointed by the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. This was corroborated by
                        the evidence of Ms Koo who testified that all instructions in respect
                        of the purchase of the Property came from the 1st plaintiff. Although
                        the defendant alleged in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that she had
                        specifically instructed Ms Koo to approach the owners of the Property
                        to find out whether they were willing to sell the Property, Ms Koo
                        testified under cross-examination that there was no such instruction from
                        the defendant. In fact, Ms Koo further testified that the
                        defendant’s name was inserted in the option to purchase the Property
                        on instructions from the 2nd plaintiff and interestingly, she verified those
                        instructions not from the defendant, but from the 1st plaintiff instead. If
                        the monies were extended as loans to the defendant, there would be no
                        conceivable reason for the 1st plaintiff to appoint an agent to source for a
                        unit at PPK. Such an act, in addition to the fact that the 1st plaintiff had
                        issued all instructions in respect of the purchase of the Property down to
                        naming the defendant as the purchaser, was more consistent with the
                        plaintiffs having an investment interest in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the defendant’s claim
                        that she was “a bit tight with money at that point of time”
                        and hence had requested the plaintiffs to advance her $3,200.00 and
                        $28,800.00 for the 1% option fee and the 9% balance deposit respectively is
                        not supported by the objective evidence. The defendant admitted during
                        cross-examination that at the material time, she owned four properties,
                        including two condominiums in Singapore, a “5-star”
                        condominium in Malaysia and a Housing Development Board
                        (“HDB”) flat at Tanglin Halt Road (“the Other
                        Properties”). Moreover, she also had about $150,000.00 in her various
                        fixed deposit accounts which were “liquid”, <em>ie</em>, they could be withdrawn anytime. Therefore, by her own
                        evidence, there was strictly no necessity for the defendant to borrow any
                        money from the plaintiffs to purchase the Property in the first place. If
                        the Property was intended as a purchase for the benefit of the defendant
                        alone, she could have easily utilised her own financial resources to
                        purchase the Property as she did for her purchase of the Other
                        Properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, it is undisputed that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff
                        and the defendant sought to secure loans from banks to finance the purchase
                        of the Property as co-borrowers. Two banks, <em>ie</em>
                        RHB Bank Berhad and Hong Leong Finance Limited, were approached by the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and/or the defendant to finance
                        the purchase of the Property. Although the loan application was subsequently
                        aborted, such conduct in seeking a loan as co-borrowers was more consistent
                        with the purchase of the Property as a co-investment rather than a loan. If
                        the loan application had gone ahead, it would be ludicrous for the defendant
                        to contend that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff became a
                        co-borrower from the bank in order to lend the money to the defendant to
                        finance the purchase. After the loan application was aborted, the monies for
                        the purchase substantially came from the plaintiffs. There is no reason to
                        view the purchase of the Property as anything other than a co-investment
                        because the plaintiffs had made direct financial contributions instead of
                        securing finance from the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Further, the defendant was able
                        to obtain financing for her purchase of the Other Properties. No reason was
                        provided by the defendant as to why she could not have raised her own
                        financing for the purchase of the Property without any involvement of the
                        plaintiffs if the Property was indeed not intended to be a
                        co-investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the defendant alleged at the trial that she had made three requests
                        for loans from the plaintiffs. These requests added up to the Sums disbursed
                        by the plaintiffs. However, not only were details on these loan requests not
                        pleaded by the defendant, she was also unable to provide details of the
                        terms of the alleged loans under cross-examination, except for a bare
                        allegation that the loans were repayable on demand:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the defendant’s
                        pleaded case is that the alleged repayment to the 2nd plaintiff was $358.00
                        per month. It is not disputed that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff contributed a total of
                        $127,236.04 to the purchase of the Property. It is difficult to believe that
                        the 2nd plaintiff, who does not own any private property and is nowhere as
                        financially secure as compared to the defendant, would advance such a huge
                        loan to the defendant, without interest, which would take about thirty years
                        to repay based on a monthly repayment of $358.00. I find that the monthly
                        payments of $1,147.00 and $358.00 were instead the 1st and 2nd
                        plaintiffs’ respective shares of the rental income. The initial rental
                        income for the Property was $2,200.00 per month. The net rental after
                        deductions amounted to $1,792.00. The monthly payments of $1,147.00 and
                        $358.00 to the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs respectively represented 64% and 20%
                        of the net rental income which matched the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs’
                        shares in the Property. This was no coincidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, the defendant’s claims
                        that the Sums were loans which were repayable on demand and that she has not
                        repaid the outstanding amount to the plaintiffs in spite of the commencement
                        of the present proceedings because they have not demanded repayment are
                        likewise inconsistent with the evidence. The defendant claimed during the
                        trial that she had repaid the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff a sum
                        of $15,000.00 on 27 January 2006 without any request by the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. The defendant did so even
                        though the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was only paid $358.00
                        per month. The defendant’s repayment is more consistent with the
                        plaintiffs’ claim that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff had advanced $15,000.00 on the
                        defendant’s behalf at Completion (as part of the defendant’s
                        $50,000.00 contribution towards the purchase of the Property) and that the
                        defendant was simply repaying the $15,000.00 advance which was paid on her
                        behalf by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff at
                    Completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_g"></a>(g)     Seventh, the plaintiffs attended the Completion of the Property at the
                        solicitor’s office and were the parties who ensured that the Sums were
                        duly paid to the relevant parties with respect to the purchase of the
                        Property. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff was also heavily
                        involved with respect to the Property, having paid all monthly maintenance
                        and other outgoings, and also undertook all renovation works jointly with
                        the defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff also
                        frequently sourced for tenants and pursued some of the tenants for payment
                        of rent during the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                            2<sup>nd</sup> tenancy periods. Such acts are entirely
                        consistent with co-ownership of the Property rather than a loan. The
                        defendant also admitted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff
                        sourced and collected the rent because he was <em>managing</em> the Property:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Again there was no logical reason for the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff to manage the Property if he
                        had merely extended loans to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_h"></a>(h)     Eighth, the tenant of the Property, one Ng Sze
                        Mee Therese, filed an affidavit dated 10 December 2010 which stated that the
                        defendant had informed her that she needed to consult the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff before confirming the tenancy.
                        Her affidavit was accepted without cross-examination. This undisputed fact
                        is again more consistent with the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff
                        having a share in the Property rather than being a creditor of the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_i"></a>(i)     Ninth, the plaintiffs were able to produce a copy of the notebook entries
                        recorded by the defendant. The defendant claimed that she was no longer in
                        possession of the original notebook. On one of the pages (PB 124) the
                        figures of “64%”, “20%” and “16%”
                        were written on it. It was also written on the same page that the amounts of
                        money which each party had contributed towards the purchase of the Property
                        were “Brother share $205k”, “Mui $50k” and

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>It was not suggested nor put to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        plaintiffs that the allegedly disputed entries were written by them instead.
                        In the circumstances, I find that all the entries at PB 124 were written by
                        the defendant. It is no coincidence that the percentages and payments stated
                        on PB 124 matched the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff’s, the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s and the
                        defendant’s respective shares of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_j"></a>(j)     Tenth, in her email dated 3 May 2007
                        to the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, the defendant asked the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to buy “one <em>more</em> PPK complex unit” using the monies left
                        behind by their mother. In that same email, the defendant assured the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff that she would not cheat him or
                            “<em>makan the hse [sic] for
                        herself</em>”. In my view, it is clear from this email that the
                        defendant recognised that the Property was purchased as a co-investment and
                        that she was inviting the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to
                        undertake another co-investment in another PPK unit similar to the
                        Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_k"></a>(k)     Finally and perhaps most crucially, the Certificate of Title to the
                        Property was kept by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. In
                        addition, although the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs lodged a caveat against
                        the Property claiming an interest on 18 May 2009, the defendant did not
                        take any step to challenge the validity of the caveat until after the
                        commencement of the present action by the plaintiffs. The safe keeping of
                        the title deeds by the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff together
                        with the absence of any protest by the defendant as regards the lodging of
                        the caveat are entirely consistent with co-investment of the Property by the
                        plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In light of the above reasons, I find that the
                    Sums were disbursed by the plaintiffs as their contributions to the
                    co-investment in the Property, and not as loans to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant’s main defence eventually
                    rested on the doctrine of illegality to rebut the resulting trust. The bulk of
                    the defendant’s closing submissions was directed to address this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for the defendant accepted that if the
                    court finds that the payments by the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiffs were capital contributions and not
                    loans to the defendant, a resulting trust in the proportions of their respective
                    capital contributions would follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the defendant submitted that even if
                    this was so, the fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff had
                    already made a booking to purchase a HDB Build-to-Order flat (“BTO
                    flat”) meant that he could not then retain any beneficial interest in the
                    Property because this would contravene s 47(1) of the Housing and Development
                    Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“HDA”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) No person shall be entitled to purchase any flat, house or other
                        living accommodation sold subject to the provisions of this Part if such
                        person, his spouse or any authorised occupier —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) is the owner of any other flat, house, building or land or has an
                        estate or interest therein; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) has, at any time within 30 months immediately prior to the date of
                        making an application to the Board to purchase the same, or between the date
                        of such application and the date of completion of the purchase of the flat,
                        house or other living accommodation, sold any flat, house, building or land
                        of which he was the owner, or divested himself of any interest
                        therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant further argued that since the plaintiffs’ case is
                    built upon the premise of a valid, legal and enforceable trust, and that such a
                    trust would entail a breach of s 47(1) of the HDA, it is therefore wholly
                    void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the circumstances, the defendant argued
                    that the illegality affects the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff in
                    the same way that it affects the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff as the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was equally aware of the reasons
                    for the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s inability to own the
                    Property in his own name given that both plaintiffs filed a joint affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“Joint AEIC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is important to note that the defendant did
                    not plead illegality in her Defence and O 18 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) clearly requires a party
                    to specifically plead any matter showing illegality. Moreover, at the conclusion
                    of the trial, no leave to amend the pleadings was applied for. Be that as it
                    may, where a transaction is manifestly illegal on its face, the court can
                    intervene on its own motion and refuse to enforce it, even if the illegality was
                    not specifically pleaded or alleged (see <em>Econ Corp Ltd v So
                        Say Cheong Pte Ltd</em> [2004] SGHC 234 at [11]). In this case, there is no issue of
                    prejudice to the plaintiffs as regards this unpleaded point since it was clearly
                    stated in their Joint AEIC that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff
                    could not own the Property because he had already made a booking for a BTO flat
                    at the material time. Paragraphs 27 and 28 of the Joint AEIC provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Later the 2nd Plaintiff discovered from a conversation with his Church
                        friend that as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff had booked to
                        buy a Build-to-Order Flat (HDB) the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff
                        under HDB rules cannot purchase any private property. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was not aware of this ruling as
                        it was the first time he was buying a direct purchase flat from HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the premises it was then mutually decided by all three (3) of us that
                        the Option would be granted in the sole name of the Defendant who will hold
                        the Property in trust for all three...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Likewise this was admitted as such by the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant’s written submissions made
                    references to several well-established cases on the doctrine of illegality.
                    Having examined those cases, I find them to be of no assistance to the
                    defendant’s case whatsoever. It is clear from those cases that when a
                    court considers the defence of illegality, the focus is whether the claimant is
                    required to rely on the deception and/or illegal purpose in order to ground the
                    claim. This principle is clearly borne out by cases such as <em>Palaniappa Chettiar v Arunasalam Chettiar</em> [1962] MLJ 143
                        (“<em>Palaniappa</em>”), <em>Suntoso Jacob v Kong Miao Ming</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R)
                    524 (“<em>Suntoso Jacob</em>”), and <em>American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 (“<em>Hong Lam
                    Marine</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Palaniappa</em>, a
                    father transferred to his son without consideration 40 acres of a rubber
                    plantation with a view to avoiding the Rubber Regulations then in force in
                    Malaysia and thereafter sought to recover from his son the land he had
                    transferred. The Privy Council held that for the father to succeed in his claim,
                    he had to prove not only that the property was transferred to his son without
                    any consideration, but had to also rebut the presumption of advancement in
                    favour of his son in respect of the property, and he could only succeed in
                    discharging these burdens by disclosing that he had practised a deception on the
                    public administration. Hence, the Privy Council decided that it would not lend
                    its aid to him to recover the property. As Lord Denning held at p 145:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In these circumstances it was essential for the father to put forward a
                        convincing explanation why the transfer took the form it did, and the
                        explanation that he gave disclosed that he made the transfer for a
                        fraudulent purpose, namely, to deceive the public administration into
                        thinking that he only held 99 acres of land and his son 40 acres, whereas in
                        truth he himself meant to hold the whole 139 acres. Once this disclosure was
                        made by the father, the courts were bound to take notice of it, even though
                        the son had not pleaded it: see <em>Scott v Brown, Doering,
                            McNab &amp; Co</em> [1892] 2 QB 724.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>Suntoso
                    Jacob</em>, the appellant transferred shares to the respondent to
                    circumvent the administrative guidelines promulgated by the Registrar of Ships.
                    The appellant subsequently decided to transfer the said shares to another party
                    and requested the respondent to hand over the share certificate so as to effect
                    the registration of the transfer. When the respondent refused to do so, the
                    appellant initiated an action seeking a declaration that the respondent was not
                    entitled to the said shares and that he only held them as trustee for the
                    appellant. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge’s decision and
                    dismissed the appellant’s appeal. Specifically, the Court of Appeal held
                    at [13] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant's claim is not based on any independent right of ownership
                        of the said shares; like the father in the <em>Chettiar</em> case (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em>) he had transferred the property to the
                        transferee on the understanding that the latter was to hold it on trust for
                        him. <em>To recover the property he has to rely on the trust
                            created in his favour and in so doing the illegal purpose of the
                            transfer that gave rise to the trust emerged</em>. Even if the
                        appellant is relying on the resulting trust of the said shares by virtue of
                        the transfer thereof to the respondent without any payment, the unlawful
                        purpose of the transfer cannot be ignored. It is too artificial to sever the
                        purpose from the transaction, <em>ie</em> the transfer
                        of the said shares to the respondent without any payment, and look at only
                        the transaction in isolation and say that it was not tainted by the unlawful
                        purpose. The intention of the parties and the purpose of the transaction are
                        clearly relevant. Where a transaction which on the face of it is lawful is
                        entered into for an unlawful purpose or to achieve an unlawful end, the
                        transaction is tainted with illegality and is unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the other hand, <em>Hong Lam
                        Marine</em> can be distinguished from both <em>Palaniappa</em> and <em>Suntoso Jacob</em>. In
                        <em>Hong Lam Marine</em>, a shipbuilding agreement was
                    backdated to enable a vessel to be registered as a Singapore ship. The
                    appellants argued that the bonds (issued by the appellants and procured in
                    favour of the respondent by the shipyard) should have been held by the
                    arbitrators to be unenforceable because the respondents had used the
                    shipbuilding agreement to deceive the Registrar of Ships. Dismissing the
                    appellant’s appeal, the Court of Appeal held at [67] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he purpose of the shipbuilding agreement was not to deceive the
                        Registrar. In fact, the purpose of the agreement was perfectly legitimate
                        and proper. The building of the vessel involved no illegality. Even the
                        backdating itself was not illegal and it was the purpose of the backdating
                        which was tainted with illegality; in other words, the backdating only
                        became illegal when it was used for an illegal purpose - to obtain
                        registration of the vessel in Singapore, which it was not entitled to...
                            [<em>T]he respondents did not need to rely on the
                            backdating in order to succeed in their counterclaim against the
                            shipyard. It was not necessary for them to found their claim against the
                            shipyard as the owners of a Singapore-registered ship, as their cause of
                            action was based on the delay in the delivery of the vessel in breach of
                            a specific term of the shipbuilding agreement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In short, <em>Palaniappa</em> and <em>Suntoso Jacob</em>
                    illustrate the point that illegality would only be a bar to enforcement of a
                    claim if the claimant had to rely on or to disclose the illegal purpose in order
                    to enforce that claim. However, <em>Hong Lam Marine</em>
                    makes it clear that illegality <em>per se</em> is not a bar
                    for enforcement if the claim itself is not grounded on that
                illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, the defendant’s
                    counsel readily conceded that the plaintiffs need not rely on either the alleged
                    deception or the illegal purpose to enforce the resulting trust against the
                    defendant. This must be right, given that there is no deception with respect to
                    the Property. The resulting trust arises from the plaintiffs’ capital
                    contributions towards the purchase of the Property. It follows that the alleged
                    illegality does not preclude the declaration of the resulting trust in favour of
                    the plaintiffs based on their capital contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It also bears mention that the plaintiffs are
                    seeking to enforce their claims in respect of the Property and not some HDB
                    flat. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s purpose in
                    registering the defendant as sole owner of the Property is distinct from his
                    decision to contribute to the purchase price of the Property. Consequently, the
                    presumed resulting trust arising from the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    plaintiff’s contribution to the purchase price and which grounds his cause
                    of action remains untainted by the illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I also note that s 47(1) of the HDA does not
                    expressly provide that it is illegal for an HDB flat owner to own a share in a
                    private property. Therefore, s 47(1) of the HDA, on its face, does not
                    prohibit the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff from owning a share in the
                    Property. Instead, it only prohibits the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    plaintiff from owning a HDB flat if he is already the owner of another
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, the defendant’s counsel
                    submitted that it is “<em>impliedly”</em>
                    illegal under s 47(1) of the HDA for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    plaintiff to have a share in the Property as he was already an owner of a BTO
                    flat. In support of his contention, the defendant relied on the decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Cheong Yoke Kuen and others v Cheong Kwok
                        Kiong</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1126 (“<em>Cheong
                        Yoke Kuen</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Cheong Yoke
                        Kuen</em>, the property (unlike the present case) which was the
                    subject matter of the litigation was an HDB flat. It was initially registered in
                    the names of the respondent and his mother. Subsequently, the respondent decided
                    to purchase another HDB flat. However, the respondent could not do so since he
                    was already a registered owner of another HDB flat with his mother. The
                    respondent then transferred his share to his mother and thereafter bought
                    another HDB flat. Later, when the respondent’s mother passed away, the
                    respondent commenced a suit for a declaration that the property was held in
                    resulting trust for him and did not form part of the mother’s estate. The
                    Court of Appeal declined to grant the declaration because the resulting trust
                    was expressly stated to be void under s 51(4) of the HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I find <em>Cheong Yoke
                        Kuen</em> to be of no assistance to the defendant. First, just like in
                        <em>Suntoso Jacob</em> and <em>Palaniappa Chettiar</em>, the respondent in <em>Cheong
                        Yoke Kuen</em> failed in his action because he had to rely on the
                    illegal purpose of the transfer to enforce his resulting trust claim. Here, the
                    plaintiffs need not rely on either the alleged deception or the illegal purpose
                    to enforce the resulting trust against the defendant. Accordingly, the alleged
                    illegality does not preclude the declaration of the resulting
                trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Second, the defendant’s counsel sought
                    to rely on [23] of <em>Cheong Yoke Kuen</em> to support his argument that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff is prohibited from holding a
                    beneficial interest in the Property:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>By virtue of this provision, the respondent was
                            prohibited from purchasing the new flat at Serangoon North Avenue so
                            long as he retained a beneficial interest in the old flat</em>.
                        The words "estate or interest" in s 47(1)(<em>a</em>)
                        are broad enough to encompass the respondent's beneficial interest in the
                        flat. It is apparent to us that in order to comply with s 47 the respondent
                        transferred his entire interest in the flat to his mother. <em>But having acquired the new flat he is not eligible to hold any
                            interest in the old flat, and therefore the resulting trust arising in
                            his favour would be against the policy consideration contended by
                            counsel</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In particular, the first sentence of [23] appears to suggest that the respondent in
                    that case was prohibited from purchasing the new flat so long as he retained a
                    beneficial interest in the old flat. However, to truly understand what the Court
                    of Appeal had meant in [23], it is
                    important to read [23] as a whole.
                    Notably, the last sentence of [23]
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>But having acquired the new flat he is not eligible to
                            hold any interest in the old flat</em>, and therefore the
                        resulting trust arising in his favour would be against the policy
                        consideration contended by counsel</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is clear from the italicised words that
                    once the respondent in <em>Cheong Yoke Kuen</em> acquired
                    the new flat, he was no longer eligible to hold any interest in the <em>old</em> flat and any resulting trust in his favour with
                    respect to the <em>old</em> flat would be contrary to the
                    policy considerations under the HDA. Similarly, once the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff acquired a beneficial interest
                    in the Property, he is not eligible to hold any interest in his <em>BTO flat</em>. However, that is not the issue before me in
                    this case. The resulting trust in this case is with respect to the Property, and
                    not the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s BTO flat. Hence,
                    it follows that the resulting trust arising in favour of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff is neither illegal nor contrary to
                    the policy considerations of the HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Finally, even if the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s claim is tainted by his
                    illegality (which I have found not to be the case here), I fail to see how the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff is precluded from enforcing his
                    claim just because he was aware of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    plaintiff’s inability to own the Property given his ownership of the BTO
                    flat. First, no authority was cited by the defendant to support this
                    proposition. Second, and more importantly, there is no legal impediment or
                    prohibition whatsoever for the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to have
                    a rightful share of the Property in proportion to his capital contributions. His
                    capital contributions were separate and distinct from the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s. Finally, the
                    defendant’s counsel also admitted that the defendant was similarly aware
                    of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s inability to own the
                    Property given his ownership of the BTO flat, and would not be able to enforce
                    her claim to the Property just like the
                    1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff. Taking the defendant’s
                    argument to its logical conclusion would therefore result in an absurd situation
                    whereby the Property would belong to no one because all parties would have been
                    precluded from enforcing their respective claims to the Property simply because
                    each of them was aware that the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, as one
                    of the co-investors, was prohibited from having a separate and distinct share in
                    the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the circumstances, I determine that there
                    is no merit whatsoever in the defendant’s illegality
                defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of the defendant’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I pause here to comment on the credibility of
                    the defendant’s evidence during the trial. Under cross-examination, the
                    defendant was often combative and evasive, resorting to her main theme –
                    that the Sums were loans from the plaintiffs – without really answering
                    the questions directed at her from the plaintiffs’ counsel and also from
                    the Bench. Even on straightforward questions she would feign misunderstanding
                    and provide irrelevant answers or revert to her main theme. Throughout the
                    trial, there were many examples of the defendant’s lack of candour and
                    evasiveness. I found that the defendant was not forthright in her answers. She
                    even fabricated excuses to distance herself from her own emails, particularly
                    her email dated 3 May 2007 in which she invited the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff to invest in another PPK unit.
                    Although the said email read “<em>Let buy one more PPK
                        complex unit</em> use mum money don’t distribute to me and
                    tiong”, the defendant insisted that “Let buy one more PPK complex

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Use of joint affidavits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     O 41 r 2 of the Rules of Court permits an
                    affidavit to be made by two or more deponents:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Where an affidavit is made by 2 or more deponents, the names of the
                        persons making the affidavit must be inserted in the attestation except
                        that, if the affidavit is sworn by both or all the deponents at one time
                        before the same person, it shall be sufficient to state that it was sworn by
                        both (or all) of the abovenamed deponents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) When the oath is administered to deponents in different languages,
                        there shall be a separate attestation for those sworn in each
                        language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A joint affidavit may be useful and appropriate in certain limited
                    matters, for example, a joint expert report made by two experts who possess
                    similar expertise to arrive at a joint opinion, or a joint correction made by
                    two deponents where the facts deposed to are very limited and
                    uncontroversial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, the plaintiffs had
                    affirmed a Joint AEIC for the trial. However, I find that it is <em>generally</em> not good practice for two or more parties to
                    affirm a joint <em>factual</em> affidavit for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     During a trial, witnesses are
                        examined in turn and are never jointly examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     It is unlikely that a witness will
                        possess the same degree of knowledge of the material facts as another
                        witness, especially when it concerns multiple events spanning over a few
                        years. This is especially so when there are events which only one of the
                        witness can testify to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Here, it was also clear that there were
                    certain events in which both plaintiffs were not present at the same time. For
                    example, only the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and the defendant
                    visited the solicitor’s office at Completion to discuss about the payment
                    of completion monies and completion matters. Post Completion, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff also left much of the
                    management of the Property to the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and
                    the defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff paid all monthly
                    maintenance and other outgoings, undertook all renovation works jointly with the
                    defendant and also frequently sourced for tenants and chased some of the tenants
                    for payment of rent during the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> tenancy periods. Accordingly, the level,
                    extent and nature of the 2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s
                    knowledge of the relevant events were quite different from that of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Accordingly, the filing of the Joint AEIC was
                    wholly inappropriate. It was an undesirable drafting shortcut which should not
                    have been adopted in this case. In fact, the defendant relied on the Joint AEIC
                    to establish that the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff was aware of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff’s inability to own the
                    Property. Therefore if joint affidavits are improperly used, it could actually
                    create unnecessary difficulties for the deponents when they seek to distance
                    themselves from certain statements in such joint affidavits on the basis that
                    they do not have personal knowledge of some of the matters stated
                    therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In light of the above findings, I make the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     I declare that the Property is held
                        on trust by the defendant for the plaintiffs according to the trust
                        shareholding of 64.1% in favour of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, 20.3% in favour of the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and 15.6% in favour of the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     An
                        injunction to restrain the defendant whether by herself, her servants or
                        agents from transferring the Property or in any way dealing with the tenancy
                        of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Property be sold and the net proceeds distributed according to
                        the trust shareholding of 64.1% in favour of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, 20.3% in favour of the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and 15.6% in favour of the
                        defendant within six months from the date hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendant to account to the
                        plaintiffs for all rental collected in respect of the Property from August
                        2007 till to-date and to pay such rental to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        plaintiffs in accordance with the trust shareholding of 64.1% in favour of
                        the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, 20.3% in favour of the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff and 15.6% in favour of the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        costs of this action be paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs on a
                        standard basis to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
