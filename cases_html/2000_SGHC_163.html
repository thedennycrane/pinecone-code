<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 In these proceedings, which have arisen

in the wake of matrimonial proceedings between the plaintiff and the 4<sup>th</sup>

defendant, the plaintiff in asserting proprietary claims sought a declaration that the 1<sup>st</sup>,

2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants as registered owners of the property known as

Lot 1112 TS 25 with the house erected thereon known as No. 23 Margoliouth Road, Singapore

258549 (the property ) were constructive trustees accountable to the plaintiff for 40% of

1/5 share in the property. Secondly, she also sought a parallel but alternative

declaration that the plaintiff was an equitable tenant in common of 8% of the property

which is equivalent to 40% of 1/5 share in the property on the basis, as I gathered from

the plaintiff’s submissions, that she was alternatively the beneficiary under a

resulting trust. She further sought consequential orders for the sale of the property and

payment of her share to her out of the net proceeds of sale. As against the 4<sup>th</sup>

defendant, she specifically sought an order that the sum equivalent to 10% (with interest)

standing to the credit of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in his Central Provident Fund

Account as at 16 January 1995 be charged in her favour with immediate effect.. At the

conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the applications of the plaintiff with costs to the

4<sup>th</sup> defendant and with one set of costs collectively for the 1<sup>st</sup> to

3<sup>rd</sup> defendants. On 7 June 2000 the plaintiff filed her Notice of Appeal. I now

give my give my reasons for dismissing her applications.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 The plaintiff resides overseas and

visits Singapore two or three times a year. She is paid by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant

the monthly maintenance of $2,000.00. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the mother of the 2<sup>nd</sup>,

3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> defendants. The late Lee Poo Lai was her husband and

father of the other defendants. Mr Lee Poo Lai passed away in January 1999. In 1983 the

plaintiff married the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. They have 2 children. In 1987 the late Mr

Lee Poo Lai and the defendants purchased the property as joint tenants. It became the home

of the extended family. At that time, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants

were students. In 1992, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant to the knowledge of the plaintiff

transferred without any consideration his interest under the joint tenancy to the other

defendants. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 In 1995 the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant

filed Divorce Petition No. 2385 of 1995. In 1996, the Decree Nisi was granted on the

plaintiff’s cross-petition. On 31 January 1997 the High Court made an order pursuant

to section 106 of the Women’s Charter. It stated: "The Respondent be given 40%

of the one-fifth share of the petitioner in the property known as 23 Margoliouth Road,

Singapore, that is, the sum of $760,000. The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant appealed against the

ancillary orders which included the order for division of matrimonial property. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The High Court delivered the following

Grounds of Decision on 31 January 1997:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(a) Matrimonial property:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Order that the respondent is entitled to a

  share in the one-fifth share of the petitioner in No. 23 Margoliouth Road. This is for the

  reason that I do not accept the argument of the petitioner that his one-fifth share was a

  gift to him by his parents.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">There is overwhelming evidence that from

  1981 when the petitioner started working in the family business, he became, over the

  years, the main person responsible for running the family business.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Further after his marriage to the

  respondent in 1983 and after the parties went to live in Margoliouth property, he made it

  known to the respondent that this was their matrimonial home; notwithstanding that the

  Margoliouth property was also the home of his parents and his two brothers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, I find that the respondent must

  have share in the one-fifth share of the petitioner.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">On the evidence, I rule that the

  respondent be given 40% of the one-fifth share, i.e. the sum of $760,000." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 The Court of Appeal reduced the

maintenance payable to the plaintiff but dismissed his appeal against the order made under

section 106 of the Women’s Charter. However, the Court of Appeal allowed him to pay

the sum of $760,000.00 by 2 instalments. On 26 September 1997 the Court of Appeal ordered:

"The Petitioner/Appellant do forthwith pay to the Respondent one half of $760,000 and

the other half before the end of this year." All other orders of the High Court were

ordered to remain.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 The plaintiff was not paid. By an

ex-parte application the plaintiff obtained and registered a Writ of Seizure and Sale

against the property. Upon being notified the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants

filed Originating Summons No. 841 of 1999 and they sought a declaration that the plaintiff

had no claim to or interest in the property and that the Order of Court Instrument No.

I/51462M (Writ of Seizure and Sale) registered by the plaintiff against the property be

removed. Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) heard the application. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 By his Order made on 23 July 1999 Chao

Hick Tin J declared "that on the basis of the order of the High Court dated 31<sup>st</sup>

January 1997 in Divorce Petition No. 2385 of 1995 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal

in Civil Appeal No 30 of 1997 dated 26<sup>th</sup> September 1997, the defendant (i.e.

the plaintiff in these proceedings) has no claim or interest in the property known as Lot

1112 TS 25 together with the house erected thereon known as No. 23 Margoliouth Rod,

Singapore …which is registered in the name of the plaintiffs (i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup>

to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in these proceeds)." [The brackets and the words within

them are added]. It was consequentially ordered that the application for registration of

the Order of Court Instrument I/51462M registered by the defendant against the property be

cancelled or removed from the land register and that the Registrar of Titles be directed

to register the Order made herein against the property. The plaintiff did not appeal

against those orders.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Plaintiff’s Contentions</font></p></b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The contentions of the plaintiff’s counsel in his

submissions may be summarised as follows. It was asserted on her behalf that the first

three defendants, though legal owners of the property as respects all shares in it, hold

it in equity upon resulting or constructive trusts for the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. The

two types of trusts, particularly their distinction, was succinctly discussed and applied

to the facts in Cheong Yoke Kuen &amp; Ors v Cheong Kwok Kiong <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 476</nobr>. Para 17

of the judgment the Court of Appeal referred to the case of Tan Poh Soon v Phua Sin Yin

<nobr>[1995] 3 SLR 201</nobr> and pointed out the difference between the two trusts in these terms:

"The nature of a constructive trust is such that it could not be said to be

‘created’ by the parties. It is a trust which is <i>imposed</i> by equity in

respect of an interest in a property in a variety of circumstances and which would render

it inequitable for the owner of the property or any interest therein to hold it for his

benefit. It arises independently of the intention of the parties. A resulting trust,

however, is different. It arises from a certain transaction carried out intentionally by

the parties concerned and the court infers an intention to create a trust in favour of a

party. The nature of this trust is summarised succinctly in Parker and Mellows <i>The

Modern Law of Trusts </i>91998, 7<sup>th</sup> Ed) at p 36: Implied or resulting trusts

arise where a settlor or testator <i>carries out some intentional act </i>other than the

creation of a relationship of trustee and beneficiary from which the court infers a

relationship of trustee and beneficiary. They consequently arise from the <i>unexpressed

but presumed intention </i>of the settlor or testator.[Emphasis added]."</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">My Reasons</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 The ground relied upon as giving rise to either of these

types of trust was the fact that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant had transferred his interest

as joint tenant without any consideration. It was then submitted, without further

elaboration, that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant therefore held an "equitable"

interest in the property to the extent of his 1/5<sup>th</sup> share. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 In my view the correct analysis was that a resulting

trust arose in favour of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant upon his transfer of his interest

under the joint tenancy without consideration to the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendants who held his equitable interest upon trust for him. Here, equity raised a

presumption that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant did not intend to make a gift of his

interest to the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants. It was asserted and therefore

must be accepted by the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and the 4<sup>th</sup>

defendant that the so-called consideration of $600,000.00, which was stated in the

Transfer signed by the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendants, was purely for the purpose of ascertaining the stamp duty. I thought equity in

this case, as was usually the case, did not presume that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant had

intended to make a gift to the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants. At the

bottom of it, this was simply an evidential rule. The burden of proving that the transfer

amounted to a gift rested with and was upon the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. On the evidence

before me, the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant did not adduce any evidence to discharge that

burden of proof. All that the plaintiff had to do was to make this analysis and tender

this submission before the Court of Appeal in the said appeal or before Chao Hick Tin J

(as he then was) and ask for an order that they (the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendants) as trustees under the resulting trust sell the property and pay over 40% of

the net proceeds, as ordered by the courts in respect of the division of property. These

conclusions would have followed in these proceedings but the defendants submitted that the

plaintiff was precluded from relying on these submissions as they were considered or

canvassed or should have been canvassed before the High Court in the matrimonial

proceedings, the Court of Appeal or before Chao Hick Tin J.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 On the material before me, I did not think that there

were circumstances to impose a constructive trust on the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendants based on either their refusal to recognise the interest of the 4<sup>th</sup>

defendant, who was not asserting that against them. The plaintiff herself did not have any

proprietary claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in respect of

the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant’s 1/5 equitable interest in the property. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 Could she assert any secondary

liability against the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants on the two bases, namely

recipient liability or accessory liability, as explained by the Privy Council in <i>Royal

Brunei Airlines Sdn Berhad v Tan</i> (1995) 3 All ER 97? In Royal Brunei Airlines, the

airline appointed a travel company to act as its ticketing agents. The agents were under

the agreement constituted trustees of the moneys received as airfares. The travel company

did not keep a separate trust account. All the airfares were paid into a current account

without differentiation and the defendant, Tan, as the managing director authorised their

use in the ordinary course of business. The travel company was in breach of the trust. It

became insolvent. The Privy Council held that Tan had dishonestly assisted the company in

its breach of the trust and had committed the equitable wrong against the airline. Lord

Nicholls of Birkenhead succinctly highlighted the two bases of secondary liability at p

386: "Different considerations apply for the two heads of liability. Recipient

liability is restitution-based; accessory liability is not." In the former case,

there would be a reversal of the unjust enrichment; in the latter case, the dishonest

accessory would be made to account or make good any deficiency in the trust property. <i>The

Royal Brunei Airlines</i> case is an illustration of the latter cause of action and the

remedy at work. Another example of the latter personal liability for an equitable wrong is

<i>Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson</i> [1990] Ch 265, [1991] Ch 547. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 I turn to the facts in this case. Were

the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants recipients of trust property or property

simpliciter of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant where there had been a breach of trust or

breach of fiduciary duty. The answer was to my mind in the negative. The fact of the

matter was that the transfer had taken place in 1992, well ahead of the divorce petition,

and there was nothing to suggest that the transfer was for the purpose of putting the

property beyond the reach of the plaintiff. On the scant and slender evidence led, there

seemed no room for the imposition of a constructive trust. On the bare facts as adduced,

there arose a resulting trust binding on the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendant in favour of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. Conceptually, it accorded with

orthodox analysis. There was no question of any receipt of trust property. A resulting

trust arose. But alas, as would be apparent later, this did not avail the plaintiff. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 Frankly, the matter was not looked into

and was not pursued with any degree of conviction or seriousness of purpose. Who could

guess what could have turned up in a more rigorous investigation including a cross

examination sought before Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) instead of following the

non-contentious mode of proceedings in the form of the originating summons as in this

case? Indeed, but for the evidential presumption in equity against a gift, a resulting

trust might not and could not have been found.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 Were the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>

defendants liable as dishonest accessories? There was no evidence led of any assistance,

let alone any dishonesty in any assistance. They must be taken to have accepted the

gratuitous transfer on the basis that a resulting trust would arise. That must be taken as

the basis upon which the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant had proceeded.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 I now turn to the other submissions

made on behalf of the defendants. I did not think that the doctrines of res judicata or

issue estoppel applied to the matrimonial proceedings or before the Court of Appeal on the

simple ground that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were not before those

courts. However, I came to the conclusion that the doctrine of issue estoppel,

unfortunately, operated against the plaintiff because the same issues had arisen or,

unarguably, might have arisen in the proceedings before Chao Hick Tin J. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 In <i>Seah Peng Song v Seah Peng Koon</i>

[unreported decision dated 4 September 1990 of Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was)] he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Issue estoppel may arise when a

  particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated

  and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties involving a different

  cause of action to which the same issue is relevant one of the parties seeks to reopen

  that issue." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 The Order made by Chao Hick Tin J

stated that it was made on the basis of the decision of the High Court and the Court of

Appeal. If that be the correct interpretation, and that therefore the learned Judge made

no pronouncement about the interest of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant under the doctrine of

resulting trust, it was clear that that particular point was raised and, in any case, it

was clear that that particular point might have been raised but was not raised. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 In <i>Arnold and Others v National

Westminster Bank plc</i> [1991] 3 All ER 41, Lord Keith said at p 47:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Issue estoppel, too, has been

  extended to cover not only the case where a particular point has been raised and

  specifically determined in the earlier proceedings, but also that where in the subsequent

  proceedings it is sought to raise a point which might have been but was not raised in the

  earlier."<b> </b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 I turn to the application to charge the

CPF account of the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant. The 4<sup>th</sup> defendant’s responses

were these. He said he would have agreed if the plaintiff had written to him. Secondly, he

offered to the plaintiff all his CPF monies in his Ordinary Account (less the maximum sum

to be retained), which was estimated to be about $250,000.00, in full and final settlement

of the judgment by having the same charged in her favour. The plaintiff was not correct in

suggesting that the 4<sup>th</sup> defendant would give her the "walk around".

She ought to obtain a consensual charging order. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 For these reasons I made the orders I

did.</font></p>
