In the morning of 16 May 2012, the accused drove a car into Singapore and was stopped at Singapore Customs for a routine inspection. A bundle in black tape was found within a tissue box behind the rear passenger seats of the car. The bundle contained four packets of crystalline substance which was later identified to comprise not less than 319.37 g of methamphetamine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The accused’s defence was essentially that his wife’s cousin, one Ravindran, had planted the bundle of drugs in the car without the accused’s knowledge, after the accused had rejected Ravindran’s request for him to bring the bundle into Singapore. The only reason why the accused wanted to enter Singapore was to apply for a personal loan at a bank in Woodlands. The defence points to the fact that at the time of arrest, the accused was found in possession of various documents – income statements, utilities bills and a letter confirming his employment – that were required for the application of such a loan. In turn, the Prosecution relied on mobile phone records that, in its submission, revealed a collaboration between the accused and Ravindran to import controlled drugs into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Upon a careful consideration of all the material before me, I find that the accused has not produced evidence of the required strength and relevance in order to rebut the statutory presumption of knowledge. Section 18(2) of the MDA places that burden on him, and I do not consider that he has succeeded in discharging that burden. I also find that the elements of the offence under s 7 of the MDA have been satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I therefore find the accused guilty of the offence for which he has been charged.

It relies first on s 21 of the MDA, which establishes that the owner or person in charge of a vehicle in which a controlled drug is found is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have that drug in his possession. The Prosecution argues that given that the methamphetamine was found inside a tissue box that was placed inside the Car, the Accused is presumed under s 21 of the MDA to be in possession of the methamphetamine. The Prosecution further relies on s 18(2) of the MDA, under which any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of the drug. Given that the Accused is presumed to have had the methamphetamine in his possession, he is, under s 18(2), also presumed to have known its nature.

When the Accused was arrested shortly after his entry into Singapore and was therefore unable to deliver the drugs at the appointed place and time, Ravindran became increasingly agitated and therefore sent the Accused a series of angry and threatening text messages, demanding to know why the Accused was late or had failed to turn up, and warning the Accused of the dire consequences that the Accused would face if he did not deliver as agreed.

When the Accused left the Car to buy breakfast, Ravindran had taken the opportunity to open one of the doors of the Car – which had faulty door locks – and placed the bundle of methamphetamine within the tissue box behind the rear passenger seats.

The Accused made the inquiries “What time?” and “Have how many?” This suggests that the nature of the “work” that Ravindran might give him is time-specific. The reference to “how many” could either refer to the number of jobs or assignments from Ravindran, or could be a reference to something within the nature of the job given by Ravindran. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I also note that although the Accused testified that he had messaged Ravindran about whether there was work at Ravindran’s mobile phone shop, he informed the court that he had done so at 9pm on 15 May 2012 and that Ravindran had replied at about 9.05pm.

Following the Accused’s failure to respond to Ravindran’s messages and calls, Ravindran proceeded to issue threats of increasing – and indeed shocking – severity. Ravindran began by asking the Accused if he “want[ed] [Ravindran] to teach now”, telling him “Don’t behave like stupid”, asking whether the Accused wanted to know “what’s [his] pattern or what [he was] able to do”, and even posing death threats such as “<span class="font-italic">Pundek pundek </span>you want to die” and “You want to die right? See, okay.” At S/No 10 is another text from Ravindran to the Accused, stating “<span class="font-italic">Anak u mau</span>”. Ms Norashikin translated this as “Your child wants”, but the Accused explained that he understood this to mean “Do you want your child?”

</div> Even leaving aside the messages at S/Nos 1 to 4, I can accept that the Accused had not seen those messages at the time they were sent to his mobile phones, given that the Accused had been otherwise occupied or arrested after 6.15am on 16 May 2012. But in my view he must furnish a plausible explanation for the messages that Ravindran sent to him, and such explanation must be consistent with his defence. The simple reason is that other than Ravindran himself, the Accused is best placed to understand why Ravindran sent him those messages. The Accused was the intended recipient, and it would be most unlikely that Ravindran would send him an entire string of text messages that the Accused somehow did not understand and could not explain. I therefore do not regard the Accused’s assertions that he did not know why Ravindran sent him those messages as any good reply to the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Subsequently, the Accused suggested that the reason why Ravindran appeared so angry was that the Accused had not answered Ravindran’s call, at a time when the drugs remained in the Car without the Accused’s knowledge.

</div>
</div> I do not regard this as a satisfactory explanation. While Ravindran might have been anxious to contact the Accused so that he could somehow secretly retrieve the drugs that he had planted from the Car, it does not make sense that he would verbally abuse and threaten the Accused in the manner and to the extent that he did, in light of the fact (as alleged by the Accused) that the Accused did not know what was in the Car and had made no arrangements to meet Ravindran or any of his representatives in Singapore. Simply put, if Ravindran and the Accused really had not made any pre-arranged plans that the Accused was responsible to carry out and had failed to do so, there seems to be little reason or basis for Ravindran to flare up at the Accused in the manner that he did, much less to threaten the well-being of the Accused and his child. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Failure to explain aspects of Ravindran’s text messages </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Equally significantly, the content of some of the messages that Ravindran sent to the Accused would make no sense at all if the Accused’s explanation was accepted. I refer first to the message at S/No 8 of Table 1, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “<span class="font-italic">Pundek </span>pick up<span class="font-italic"> </span>China<span class="font-italic"> tauke </span>waiting”. This begs an explanation of who the “China <span class="font-italic">tauke</span>” was, and what exactly he was waiting for. The Accused’s assertion that he did not know why Ravindran had sent the message provides absolutely no context for a reasonable explanation of why Ravindran thought the Accused to be an appropriate recipient of the message. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I also refer to the equally incriminating message at S/No 19, where Ravindran stated “Use brain ok,<span class="font-italic"> keja </span>is already late”. This suggests that (i) there was “work” (or “<span class="font-italic">keja</span>”) to be carried out; (ii) the “work” was to be performed at or by a certain time; and (iii) the Accused was responsible for the lateness of the performance of the “work”. In this regard, I also observe that even going by the Accused’s account, Ravindran had not instructed him to carry out any work for his mobile phone business – in fact, Ravindran had told the Accused that there was no work (see [31] above). If this was the case, and the Accused had consequently never agreed to carry out any work for Ravindran, why would Ravindran communicate to the Accused that “<span class="font-italic">keja </span>is already late” and blame him for it, much less issue threats for the lateness of the “work”? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 When pressed, the Accused simply reiterated his explanation that Ravindran was angry that the Accused had not picked up his phone or replied to the messages.

I explained that the Defence’s account of events must fit with the objective evidence.

He was unable to do so. I find that the Prosecution’s case – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Accused had colluded with Ravindran to import the bundle of methamphetamine into Singapore by placing it in the Car – is far more consistent with the text messages than the explanation provided by the Accused. It is far more plausible that given this arrangement between the two, and the Accused’s subsequent failure to communicate with Ravindran or to deliver the bundle as planned, Ravindran became very agitated and angry and he blamed the Accused for his failure to perform as agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accuracy and reliability of the mobile phone records </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Separately, the Defence also attempted to cast doubt on the veracity of the mobile phone records.

</div> I also note that Mr Rozaili had explained, when giving evidence on his usual procedure for extracting data from mobile phones, that after the extraction of data using forensic software, he would compare that data with the information on the phone itself (see [61] above). In the circumstances, until and unless the Defence is able to demonstrate that the method Mr Rozaili used led to the extraction of inaccurate or unreliable data, I do not consider that there are sufficient grounds to impugn the method of data collection Mr Rozaili used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Defence points out that contact names are indicated on the text messages in HP2 as seen from Mr Rozaili’s photographs, but the photograph of the contacts list in HP2 reveals that the contacts list is empty.

</div> In my view, Mr Rozaili provided a reasonable explanation for this. He explained that the photograph of the contacts list showed only the contacts stored in the mobile phone itself, rather than in the SIM card, and the settings on HP2 were such that only contacts stored on the mobile phone were shown. Mr Rozaili further clarified that he had not changed the settings of HP2 to show the SIM card contacts list because in doing so he would be modifying certain aspects of the mobile phone and he did not wish to do that.

The Defence then suggests that “[g]iven that the relevant portions of the incriminating text messages have been curiously sorted out from a mess of a 48 paged document, one cannot help but wonder if the said text messages are authentic and/or complete”.

Regarding the issue of chronology, IO Mohaideen offered the explanation during his examination-in-chief that the chronological disorder might be due to the forensic software that was used. Mr Gaznavi did not question IO Mohaideen on the basis of his explanation, much less put to him that this was not the reason for the disorder. In the circumstances, I reject the Defence’s characterisation of the FORT reports as “questionable” and “dubious”.

After learning that the Accused was unwilling to participate in his plan, why would Ravindran still choose to plant the bundle in the Car, with no convenient means of retrieval and no guarantee that the Accused would agree to hand the bundle over to Ravindran or his associate once the Accused had arrived in Singapore?

I agree with the Prosecution that Ravindran would have had to be taking a significant gamble by planting the bundle in the Car. As the Prosecution notes, given the obvious value of the drugs, it is difficult to believe that Ravindran would have taken such a risk. The Accused might simply have decided to throw the drugs away (as the Accused himself informed) or brought it to the police.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my view, it is also extremely unlikely that Ravindran would have been willing to plant the bundle with no convenient means of retrieval. Although the Accused did inform Ravindran (going by the Accused’s account) that he was going to the Woodlands branch of POSB, there appears to be little means for Ravindran to ascertain exactly where the Accused would park the Car. From the text messages received on the Accused’s mobile phones, it appears that Ravindran did not know where the Accused was as he entered Singapore Customs – he did not know, for instance, that the Accused had been stopped at Singapore Customs and arrested thereafter, or Ravindran would not have proceeded to send the Accused a barrage of text messages expressing his anger that the “<span class="font-italic">keja</span>” was late. Consequently, it is unlikely that the Accused was followed into Singapore. Ravindran or his associate would thus have had to search for the parking location of the Car near the Woodlands POSB branch if they wanted to retrieve the bundle. It is arguable that the improbability of Ravindran accepting the risks involved in such a plan may not be a determinative consideration, particularly if taken alone. But I consider that this improbability does diminish the plausibility of the Accused’s account of events.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other aspects of the Accused’s narrative </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 A considerable amount of time was spent at trial on various other aspects of the Accused’s narrative by both the Defence and the Prosecution, perhaps in an effort either to buttress or to erode the credibility of the Accused, as the case may be. I will not attempt to enumerate all these aspects of the evidence, save for noting that they included the following:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the location of the motorcycle shop from which the Accused wanted to purchase a new motorcycle; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) how the Accused was to pay for the new motorcycle; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the Accused had taken leave on 16 May 2012; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) whether the Accused had previously enquired at POSB about the possibility of obtaining a loan; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) whether the Accused met the requirements to obtain a loan; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) whether Vasagi and other members of the Accused’s family could have done more to find Ravindran. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Upon a review of the evidence produced at the close of trial, I have formed the opinion that a lot of the evidence in this regard is either of peripheral relevance or would not make a difference to my determination of whether the Accused is guilty of the offence. I should say that the Defence <span class="font-italic">was</span> able to produce evidence to support certain aspects of the Accused’s account of events. For instance, it is undisputed that when the Accused was arrested, he was found to be in possession of a number of documents that would be required for an application for a bank loan, such as a letter confirming his employment, income statements and utilities bills. Those documents were produced before the court. In my view, the Accused’s claim that he intended, during the time that he was in Singapore, to apply for a bank loan is a plausible claim and supported by evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The difficulty for the Defence, however, is that while this evidence may go some way towards establishing the Accused’s credibility and indeed towards supporting some aspects of the Accused’s account, they are ultimately <span class="font-italic">not </span><span class="font-italic">inconsistent with</span> and therefore <span class="font-italic">do not rebut</span> the Prosecution’s case that the Accused intended to import the bundle of methamphetamine into Singapore. It is entirely possible that the Accused intended to apply for a bank loan in Singapore, and that this was one of the reasons for which he drove into Singapore in the morning of 16 May 2012. But this is not inconsistent with the possibility that the Accused <span class="font-italic">also</span> <span class="font-italic">intended</span>, either working on his own or in collaboration with Ravindran, to bring the bundle of methamphetamine into Singapore during the same trip, which would be a convenient thing to do. By bringing forth evidence of the Accused’s intention to apply for a bank loan, the Defence does not thereby raise a logical conundrum for the Prosecution that defeats the Prosecution’s case. What <span class="font-italic">is </span>inconsistent, in my view, is the Accused’s version of events when seen alongside the text messages found in the Accused’s mobile phones. <span class="font-italic">That </span>is an inconsistency which goes towards the heart of the alleged offence, given the incriminating nature of those messages as I have explained earlier.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remaining aspects of the submissions and evidence  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I will explain my view on some remaining aspects of the parties’ evidence and submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 One of the issues raised by the Prosecution pertains to the Accused’s behaviour at or around the time when he was stopped and the bundle was found. SSI Neo gave evidence that the Accused complained of stomach pain while the search of the Car was ongoing, but that the Accused did not continue to complain of such pain after the bundle was discovered.

</div> The Prosecution submits that if the Accused were indeed unaware of the contents of the black bundle, there would be no reason for him to repeat the word “<span class="font-italic">mati</span>”. It argues that “[t]he <span class="font-weight-bold">only</span> plausible reason why he had such a strong reaction to the discovery of the bundle and even before it was opened, is that he <span class="font-italic">already </span>knew the bundle contained illegal drugs which would attract very severe penalties” [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold].

</div> I reject the Prosecution’s submission that it is the “only” inference that could possibly be drawn. According to the Accused, he had already seen the bundle before when Ravindran sought to pass it to him to bring into Singapore. The reason why the Accused rejected the request at that time was because, going by his explanation, he suspected that the bundle could contain “<span class="font-italic">ganja</span>” (see [34] above). In my view, it is reasonable to think that upon seeing the bundle uncovered by the officers, he therefore assumed that he was in trouble because the bundle – as he had earlier suspected – might contain “<span class="font-italic">ganja</span>”. The Accused therefore reacted in a manner that indicated anxiety, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by repeatedly uttering “<span class="font-italic">mati</span>”, given his belief that he had just been found in possession of a bundle containing “<span class="font-italic">ganja</span>”. In the circumstances, I find that it would be unsafe to draw an inference, from this fact alone, that the Accused knew what the bundle contained because he had agreed to bring it into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As a final matter, I will address the fact that the HSA was unable to generate any DNA profiles from the swabs taken from the exhibits, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tissue box, the tissue box cover and the Drug Exhibits (see [18] above). The Prosecution suggests that as the tissue box and its cover had been handled a number of times, for instance by Vasagi when she took the tissue box from the Accused’s car to stem her son’s bleeding, one would ordinarily expect that a person’s DNA would be found. The Prosecution further submits that if the reason for the lack of DNA evidence is that someone had deliberately taken time to clean the tissue box and cover thoroughly, this does not sit well with the Defence’s account of how Ravindran might have planted the bundle in the tissue box, because it is unlikely that Ravindran would have had enough time to open the Car, plant the bundle, wipe the tissue box and cover to remove DNA evidence, and leave the scene before the Accused returned. While there is some force in this submission, I ultimately do not think it appropriate to preclude the possibility that Ravindran <span class="font-italic">was</span> able to do so, given that (by the Accused’s account) Ravindran was already within the vicinity of the Car at the time the Accused had left to buy his breakfast, which could also have taken some time depending on the busyness of the breakfast stall. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Final assessment and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my final assessment, the Accused is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the text messages found in his mobile phones. I find that those messages provide strong support for the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused had entered into some sort of arrangement with Ravindran for the Accused to bring drugs into Singapore and deliver them to an unknown person at a pre-appointed time. Indeed, it would not be inaccurate to say that the messages formed the centrepiece of the Prosecution’s case. In the course of trial and during closing submissions, I provided the Accused and his counsel full opportunity to provide a convincing explanation for the messages, but none was ultimately forthcoming. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Accused brought forth evidence to support and corroborate aspects of his account of events but, as I have explained, that evidence was peripheral and in the final analysis did not serve to cast doubt on the Prosecution’s case. I reiterate that the burden remains on the Accused to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. If the Accused is desirous of producing evidence, such evidence – if it is to be useful to his case – should go towards rebutting that presumption. Having reviewed the evidence in its entirety, I find that the Accused has failed to demonstrate that he did not know he was transporting methamphetamine into Singapore. The presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA has not been rebutted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For the above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has succeeded in proving all the elements of the Charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The Accused is therefore guilty as charged and I convict him accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahmood Gaznavi and S Skandarajah (Mahmood Gaznavi &amp; Partners, S Skandarajah &amp; Co) for the accused;<br/>Ong Luan Tze and Jason Chua (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Public Prosecutor.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
