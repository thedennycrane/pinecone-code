</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts</p></i><b xmlns=""> </b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The appellant, Tan Cheng

Kwee (‘Tan’), was the director in charge of Henry Transport &amp; General Agency

Company Pte Ltd (‘the company’), and was the sole person running the operations

of the company. The company transported goods in containers from warehouses to the Port of

Singapore Authority (‘PSA’) Container Terminal, and vice-versa.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The company owned two prime movers, one of which bore the licence

plate number XA 6305 S (‘the prime mover’). At the material time, it had two

drivers under its employ – Selamat bin Sa’man (‘Selamat’) and Yahya

bin Noordin (‘Yahya’).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 On 13 May 2000, Tan instructed Selamat to drive the prime mover to

Admiralty Road West in order to transport a container to the PSA Container Terminal. At

approximately 12:12 p.m. that day, after loading up the container onto his trailer,

Selamat was driving the prime mover along Hillview Road in the direction of Hillview

Avenue when the top of the container hit a height restriction gantry. The vehicle

proceeded on, but, due to its height, subsequently found itself wedged beneath the railway

bridge that passed over the road. Selamat managed to free the vehicle. Whilst attempting

to continue along its journey, the top of the container struck and damaged a second height

restriction gantry, causing it to tilt precariously to one side.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The police arrived shortly and detained Selamat. Tan was called to

the scene. It was quickly discovered that the company did not possess the licence to

operate a heavy motor vehicle that had an overall height exceeding four metres. The height

of the prime mover with trailer and container was 4.465 metres. Tan appeared to be unaware

that such a permit was necessary and promptly applied for one on behalf of the company.

Height restriction permits are valid for one year and are issued free of charge.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The charge</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 Selamat was indicted on a number of charges. Unfortunately, he

absconded whilst on bail. Tan was later charged for the following offence:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">You,</p>
<p align="center">TAN CHENG KWEE, M/47 YRS<br/>

  NRIC NO. S0126513Z</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">are charged that you on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of May 2000 in

  Singapore, did cause to be driven on public roads, a heavy motor vehicle XA 6305 S that

  has an overall height which exceeds 4 metres, without there being in force a permit from

  Deputy Commissioner of Police and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under

  section 79(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap. 276</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 Section 79 of the Road Traffic Act (‘the Act’) read as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">79. – (1) Where the overall height of a heavy motor vehicle

  exceeds 4 metres, any person who, without a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of Police,

  is in charge of or drives or causes to be driven the vehicle on a road shall be guilty of

  an offence and shall be liable on conviction –</p>
<p align="justify">(a) for a first offence, to imprisonment for a term of not less than

  one year and not more than 3 years and, in addition, to a fine not exceeding $2,000; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) for a second or subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term of

  not less than 2 years and not more than 5 years and, in addition, to a fine not exceeding

  $5,000. </p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Decision of the district court</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The district judge held that s 79 of the Act was intended to create a

strict liability offence. He was of the view that the presumption of law that <i>mens rea</i>

was a requirement of criminal liability was displaced by the fact that the provision was

concerned with an issue of social concern and public safety. It was important for vehicles

beyond a certain height to be restricted to travelling on certain roads due to height

restrictions on others. Strict liability was thus essential for the protection of the

public.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 As such, four elements had to be established in order for the

prosecution to prove its case. These were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) That the prime mover was a ‘heavy motor vehicle’ within

  the meaning of s 79 (1) of the Act;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) That the overall height of the prime mover exceeded 4 metres;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(c) That no permit was issued in respect of the prime mover;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) That Tan had caused this prime mover to be driven on public roads

  without such a permit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 The judge found that all four elements were established. In his

opinion, Tan had failed to make out a defence that he had taken reasonable care, since no

attempt had been made by Tan to check the height of the container.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The district judge found Tan guilty of the charge and sentenced him

to 14 months’ imprisonment. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all

classes of driving licences for a period of one year with effect from Tan’s date of

release from prison. Tan appealed against conviction and sentence but after hearing

counsel’s arguments I dismissed the appeal. The district judge, in his grounds of

decision, realised that he had omitted to impose a fine made mandatory by s 79(1)(a) of

the Road Traffic Act (RTA), and asked this Court to exercise its powers of revision in

order to correct the error. I therefore imposed a fine of $1,000 on Tan. However, I

revoked that part of the district judge’s order relating to the disqualification from

holding all classes of driving licences. The grounds for my decision are set out below. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 There were three key thrusts in the appeal against conviction. The

first was that s 79(1) of the Act did not create a strict liability offence. The second

was that, in any event, there was no evidence that suggested that Tan knew that the prime

mover exceeded four metres in height and therefore he did not ‘cause’ the

vehicle to be unlawfully driven. The final point was that, even if s 79(1) of the Act did

create a strict liability offence, Tan’s failure to know the facts that constituted

unlawful user did not amount to negligence and that therefore the defence of reasonable

care was available to him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 As for the appeal against sentence, the submission was that the term

of 14 months’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive, and furthermore the judge seemed

to have placed undue weight on the fact that Tan had chosen to claim trial.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Did s 79(1) create a strict liability offence?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 There is a presumption of law that <i>mens rea</i> is a necessary

ingredient of any statutory provision that creates an offence: <i>Sweet v Parsley</i>

[1970] AC 132; <i>Lim Chin Aik v R</i> [1963] MLJ 50; <i>PP v Phua Keng Tong</i> [1986] 2 MLJ 279. This presumption, however, can be rebutted by the clear language of the statute,

or by necessary implication, although it is not sufficient if the provision merely lacks

terms that are commonly associated with <i>mens rea</i>. Where an examination of the

language of the statute does not assist, the Court will have to look at all the relevant

circumstances to determine the true intention of Parliament. Such considerations include

the nature of the crime, the punishment prescribed, the absence of social obloquy, the

particular mischief and the field of activity in which the crime occurred.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 It is well known that the presumption of <i>mens rea</i> is often

displaced in situations where the statutory offence in question pertains to issues of

social concern. This is especially so in cases of public safety where the prohibited act

is not one which the public can easily protect itself against through its own vigilance.

In <i>Lim Chin Aik v R</i> [1963] MLJ 50 at 52, Lord Evershed made the following

observation:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Where the subject matter of the statute is the regulation for the

  public welfare of a particular activity … it frequently has been inferred that the

  legislature intended that such activities should be carried out under conditions of strict

  liability. The presumption is that the statute or statutory instrument can be effectively

  enforced only if those in charge of the relevant activities are made responsible for

  seeing that they are complied with. When such a presumption is to be inferred, it

  displaces the ordinary presumption of mens rea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 Even then, it must be shown that the creation of strict liability

will be effective in promoting the objects of the statute by encouraging greater care to

prevent the commission of the prohibited act: <i>Gammon Ltd v AG of Hong Kong</i> <a name="OLE_LINK1">[1984] 3 WLR 437</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The question as to whether s 79(1) of the Act was one that imposed

strict liability had been previously dealt with by the Magistrate’s Court in the case

of <i>PP v Yeo Gim Lam</i> TAC No. 844 of 1987 (unreported). In that case, the accused was

charged with driving a cargo crane, with an overall height exceeding four metres, without

the relevant licence. The boom of the loader had struck the underside of the Change Alley

aerial plaza that spanned Collyer Quay from Clifford Pier to the Singapore Rubber House.

The judge held that s 79(1) did create a strict liability offence. He said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is easy to discern the legislative intent on placing upon a person

  driving on the road a heavy motor vehicle which exceeds 4.00 metres, the duty of ensuring

  that there is a permit from the Deputy Commissioner of Police. Under subsection 2 of

  section 79 of the Act, in granting such a permit, the Deputy Commissioner of Police may

  impose such conditions as he thinks fit including conditions relating to the overall

  height of the vehicle, the lateral projection of any load carried by the vehicle, the

  maximum speed of the vehicle, the requirement for police or other escort; and of

  particular relevance to the present case, the route the vehicle is permitted to travel. In

  land scarce Singapore, it is to be expected that there will be, and as a matter of fact

  there are, numerous flyovers, pedestrian overhead bridges, aerial plazas and other similar

  overhanging structures above the roads which the public uses frequently. It is very clear

  promotion of safety. It performs the social utility of ensuring that drivers of heavy

  motor vehicles above a certain height are in possession of and, more importantly, are

  cognisant of the conditions imposed therein so that their vehicles would not pose a

  potential hazard to these overhanging structures and endanger the lives of those using

  them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 It was patently clear to me that s 79(1) of the Act fell within that

class of statutory offences that dealt with public safety. Indeed, such was the tenor of

the speech by the then Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Chua Sian Chin, during the second

reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 2 March 1984, at which the

Government first sought to make it an offence for vehicles above the height of 3.2 metres

to be driven without a licence. He said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is clear that some drivers and owners of motor vehicles which carry

  loads of excessive heights are not concerned with the dangers that they pose and the

  damage that they could cause with their irresponsible behaviour. It is also evident that

  the present penalties provided under out existing legislations are insufficient to deter

  such behaviour. It was fortuitous and fortunate that no one was hurt in all the four

  incidents I have recounted. However, we cannot rely on such good fortune and allow

  pedestrians to be constantly exposed to such risks until somebody has been hurt … The

  recklessness of some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without delay. It

  would be too late to punish them after the harm is done. In view of grave danger to public

  safety, it is necessary to provide for strict deterrent measures and heavy penalties to

  prevent the occurrence of another incident of a vehicle with a high load hitting a

  pedestrian overhead bridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 In pressing his case that s 79(1) of the Act was not to be construed

as a strict liability offence, counsel for Tan argued that the district judge had failed

to consider the significance of the mandatory minimum sentence of one year’s

imprisonment. The severity of the penalty, he said, suggested that Parliament could not

have intended this to be a strict liability offence. In support of this proposition,

counsel relied on a passage in <i>M V Balakrishnan v PP</i> [1998] 1 CLAS News 357, a

judgment of mine, which read:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In his book, "Public Welfare Offences" … Professor Sayre

  suggested that if the penalty is slight, involving, for instance, a fine, particularly if

  adequate enforcement depends upon wholesale prosecution, or if the social danger arising

  from violation is serious, the doctrine of basing liability upon mere activity rather than

  fault is sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 The passage quoted above should not be misconstrued. The severity of

the penal sanction is but one of the many factors that the Court has to take into account

in trying to ascertain Parliamentary intent. While a slight penalty may be a factor in

favour of construing an offence as one based on strict liability, there is by no means a

definitive correlation. Parliament has the power to prescribe severe penalties for strict

liability offences in order to achieve its legislative purpose. The speech of the then

Minister for Home Affairs, parts of which have been reproduced in  17 above, revealed

that the legislature had strong deterrence on its mind following the numerous collisions

that had taken place, one after another, with pedestrian overhead bridges and aerial

plazas in 1983 alone. In this regard, I found the approach taken by the Privy Council in <i>Gammon

Ltd v A-G of Hong Kong </i>[1984] 3 WLR 437 very instructive. Defence counsel in that case

had advanced the argument that the severity of the maximum penalties prescribed in the

provision in question pointed away from a strict liability construction of s40(2A)(b) of

the Hong Kong Building Ordinance. Rejecting this, Lord Scarman remarked:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">… there is nothing inconsistent with the purpose of the Ordinance

  in imposing severe penalties for offences of strict liability. The legislature could

  reasonably have intended severity to be a significant deterrent, bearing in mind the risks

  to public safety arising from some contraventions of the Ordinance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 Counsel’s next argument was that s 79(1) of the Act should only

have been interpreted as a strict liability offence if that was a matter of necessary

implication. It was not the case if it could only be reasonably implied as such. He then

referred to the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1984 and pointed out

that the then Minister of Home Affairs had not explicitly indicated that a strict

liability offence was intended. On the contrary, he had said that the "recklessness

of some inconsiderate drivers and owners must be curbed without delay". This, argued

Counsel, showed that knowledge of, or at least recklessness to, the fact of unlawful user

was a necessary ingredient of s 79(1) of the Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 While a provision should only be taken to impose strict liability if

it was a matter of necessary implication from all the circumstances, I disagreed with the

submission that knowledge or recklessness was a requisite ingredient of s 79(1). The aim

of the legislation was to curb recklessness. It did not follow that the prosecution had to

prove that an accused person had a mental element of recklessness or, for that matter, any

other mens rea element. A strict liability reading would rigorously promote the intention

of Parliament by encouraging, or coercing, drivers and owners of heavy motor vehicles to

exercise a fair degree of care and consideration in their activities. On the contrary,

imputing a state of mind as a necessity for every single element of the offence would not

only severely stultify the legislative purpose but would actually go against its very

grain. After all, drivers and owners of heavy motor vehicles with high loads risked

causing serious public harm if they did not positively take care. Harm might also be done

if they were merely passive, knew nothing or were honestly mistaken about the facts and

did not know that they had to obtain the requisite licences that would immediately tell

them which roads were out of bounds to their vehicles. Therefore, it did not make sense

that a conviction should hinge on proof of positive knowledge or intention. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 In the result, I was of the firm opinion that s 79(1) of the Act did

create a strict liability offence. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Did Tan cause the prime mover to be driven on public roads?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 The district judge had noted in his grounds of decision <a name="OLE_LINK2">that "[t]he offence of ‘causing’ unlawful user requires

proof of <i>mens rea</i> in knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful"</a>.

Counsel for Tan argued that the facts which Tan must be shown to have had knowledge of

were, firstly, that the overall height of the vehicle exceeded four metres, and secondly,

that there was no permit issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in respect of that

prime mover. He then claimed that Tan did not possess such knowledge because he had not

been told about the height of the container by the company that wanted the container

transported from Admiralty Road to the PSA Container Terminal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 I was of the view that Counsel had misunderstood the district

judge’s decision on this particular issue, which grounds read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">24 The offence of "causing" unlawful use requires proof of <i>mens

  rea</i> in knowledge of the facts rendering the user unlawful. In the case of a limited

  company, such knowledge had to be of someone exercising a directing mind over the

  company’s affairs. (see <i>James &amp; Sons Ltd v Smee </i>[1955] 1 QBD 78, <i>Ross

  Hillman Ltd v Bond</i> [1974] RTR 279).</p>
<p align="justify">25 "To cause", as pointed out by the defence, involves some

  express or positive mandate from the person "causing to the other person, or some

  authority from the former to the latter arising in the circumstances of the case. (see <i>Mcleod

  v Buchanan</i> [1940] 2 All ER 179). It has also been held in English cases that the term

  "to cause" involves some degree of control and direction (see <i>Shavner v

  Rosner</i> [1954] 2 All ER 280).</p>
<p align="justify">26 In the instant case, it is clear that the accused had knowledge of

  the facts rendering the user unlawful. In the statement of agreed facts, the accused has

  admitted that he is a Director of Henry Transport was the sole person in charge of the

  company’s motor container services. He has given evidence that it was him who had, on

  13 May 2000 [see evidence-in-chief of the accused], instructed Selamat, an employee of the

  company, via mobile radio, to proceed to Admiralty Road to pick up the container in order

  to send it to the PSA Container Port.</p>
<p align="justify">27 It is therefore clear that the accused knew of the facts rendering

  the user unlawful. There is also no doubt that as the person in charge of the

  company’s motor container services, he had some degree of control and direction over

  Selamat, an employee of the company. I was thus of the opinion that the accused did cause

  XA 6305S to be driven on a public road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 It was obvious to me from a reading of the text above that the judge

had intended the knowledge of unlawful user to relate <i>only</i> to the fact that Tan

knew that the prime mover was being driven on public roads and that he had control and

direction over that act. This was especially evident from  26, quoted above, where the

only evidence that the judge cited as proof of knowledge of unlawful user was (i.) that

Tan was the director solely in charge of the company, and (ii.) that Tan had given

instructions to his driver, Selamat, to pick up the container and send it to the PSA

Container Terminal. It was not necessary, and it certainly did not appear to be the

judge’s intention, to require the prosecution to show <i>further</i> that Tan had

knowledge that the vehicle exceeded four metres in height since the user was unlawful the

moment the actus reus of driving without the required permit took place.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 Having said that, it must also be pointed out that the citation of

the English cases of <i>Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond</i> <a name="OLE_LINK3">[1974] RTR 279</a>

and <i>James &amp; Son Ltd v Smee</i> [1955] 1 QB 78 in the district court’s grounds

of decision as support for the proposition that "[t]he offence of ‘causing’

unlawful user requires proof of <i>mens rea</i> in knowledge of the facts rendering the

user unlawful", may unfortunately have provided some inspiration for Counsel’s

present submission. These cases, however, appeared unhelpful to the present appeal in view

of the policy considerations behind, as well as the present state of law relating to

strict liability offences in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 In <i>Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond</i> [1974] RTR 279, s 40(5) of the UK

Road Traffic Act 1972 provided that "a person … (b) who uses on a road a motor

vehicle … which does not comply with any such regulations or <u><i>causes</i></u> or

permits a vehicle to be so used, shall be guilty of an offence" [emphasis added]. The

defendant, a company owning vehicles, had explicitly warned the drivers under its employ,

via notices in their pay packets and signs displayed at its premises, to be careful not to

overload their vehicles in breach of regulation 121 of the Motor Vehicles (Construction

and Use) Regulations 1969. That regulation prohibited the overloading of vehicles beyond

that stipulated in the certificate issued to specific vehicles. Notwithstanding the

warning, one of the defendant’s drivers in the course of his employment took an

unloaded lorry out of the premises and overloaded it. The defendant was charged for

causing a breach of the regulation. Distinguishing the earlier case of <i>Sopp v Long</i>

[1969] 1 All ER 855, May J, giving the main judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that in

order to prove that one had "caused" an absolute liability offence to be

committed, the prosecution would have to prove the <i>mens rea</i> of knowledge of the

facts that <i>rendered</i> the user unlawful. The defendant was thus acquitted because it

did not know that its employee had filled the vehicle beyond the maximum prescribed load;

it had also explicitly forbidden such overloading. Therefore, the defendant did not

"cause" the primary offence to take place.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 The first observation to be made about this case was that the common

law defence of due diligence or reasonable care, as enunciated in the Canadian case of <i>R

v City of Sault Ste Marie</i> <a name="OLE_LINK4">(1978) 85 DLR (3d) 161</a> and adopted

in our jurisdiction by the case of <i>M V Balakrishnan v PP </i>[1998] 1 CLAS News 357,

was not a concept available to the English Court of Appeal at that time. This was unlike

the factual matrix in <i>Sopp v Long</i> [1969] 1 All ER 855, where the defendant employer

had the benefit of statutory exceptions in the UK Weights and Measures Act 1963 to the

offence of ‘causing’ a contravention of the Act. These exceptions to liability

required the defendant to prove that he had taken all reasonable precautions and exercised

all diligence to prevent his employee from committing the offence. The court in <i>Ross

Hillman’s</i> case, on the other hand, was confronted with the situation where the

defendant had explicitly warned its employees against committing the offence and done

everything in its power to prevent breaches from occurring. To have convicted the

defendant under such circumstances would have invoked the spectre that Devlin J (as he

then was) had raised in <i>Reynolds v G H Austin &amp; Sons Ltd </i>[1951] 2 KB 135 at

149, where he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[I]f a man is punished because of an act done by another, whom he

  cannot reasonably be expected to influence or control, the law is engaged, not in

  punishing thoughtlessness or inefficiency, but in pouncing on the most convenient victim. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 The second observation about <i>Ross Hillman’s </i>case was

that it created an absolute liability offence of unlawful user for which proof of <i>mens

rea</i> was unnecessary, and a diagrammatically-opposite offence of causing unlawful user

that was a ‘true criminal offence’ requiring proof of full <i>mens rea</i>,

amongst the various limbs of a single statutory provision. In our jurisdiction, however,

it is now recognised that strict liability occupies the position of a halfway-house

between absolute liability and true criminal liability, in the sense that strict liability

is made out on proof of <i>actus reus</i> but a defence of reasonable care is open to the

accused: <i>M V Balakrishnan v PP </i>[1998] 1 CLAS News 357. With regard to the word

"cause" in relation to strict liability offences, Dickson J gave the following

instructive comments in the judgment of <i>R v City of Sault Ste Marie</i> (1978) 85 DLR

(3d) 161:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The present case concerns the interpretation of two troublesome words

  frequently found in public welfare statutes: "cause" and "permit".

  These two words are troublesome because neither denotes clearly either full <i>mens rea</i>

  nor absolute liability. It is said that a person could not be said to be permitting

  something unless he knew what he was permitting. This is an over-simplification. There is

  authority both ways, indicating that the Courts are uneasy with the traditional dichotomy.

  Some authorities favour the position that "permit" does not import <i>mens rea</i>:

  see <i>Millar v The Queen</i> (1954) 1 DLR 148; <i>R v Royal Canadian Legion</i> (1971) 21

  DLR (3d); <i>R v Teperman &amp; Sons Ltd</i> [1968] 4 CCC 67… For a <i>mens rea </i>construction

  see <i>James &amp; Son Ltd v Smee</i>, [1955] 1 QB 78; <i>Somerset v Hart</i> (1884), 12

  QBC 360 … The same is true of "cause". For a non-<i>mens rea</i>

  construction, see<i> R v Peconi</i> (1907), 1 CCC (2d) 213; <i>Alphacell Ltd v Woodward</i>,

  [1972] AC 824; <i>Sopp v Long</i>, [1969] 1 All ER 855; <i>Laird v Dobell</i>, [1906] 1 KB

  131; <i>Korten v West Sussex County Council, supra</i>; <i>Shave v Rosner</i>, [1954] 2   WLR 1057. Others say that "cause" imports a requirement for a <i>mens rea</i>:

  see <i>Lovelace v DPP</i>, [1954] 3 All ER 481; <i>Ross Hillman Ltd v Bond</i>, [1974] 2   All ER 287; Smith and Hogan, <i>Criminal Law</i>, pp 89-90…</p>
<p align="justify">The conflict in the above authorities, however, shows that in

  themselves the words "cause" and "permit" fit much better into an

  offence of strict liability than either full <i>mens rea</i> or absolute liability …</p>
<p align="justify">Proof of the prohibited act <i>prima facie</i> imports the offence, but

  the accused may avoid liability by proving that he took reasonable care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 As a final point, Counsel’s proposed approach to proving that

one had ‘caused’ unlawful user, in the context of s 79(1) as a strict liability

offence, did not make sense in light of the approach taken towards proving unlawful user

itself. A person who drove a motor vehicle that exceeded four metres in height without

possessing the requisite permit commits the strict liability offence whether or not he was

aware of the actual height of the vehicle, unless of course he could show that all due

care had already been taken. How could it be, then, that a person who ‘caused’

that same motor vehicle to be driven on the road without the permit could get away by

proving that he did not know about the height of the vehicle? I could see no rational

basis for allowing such inconsistency in approach. As far as s 79(1) of the Act was

concerned, Parliament’s intention was to cast the burden of taking care, not only on

the drivers of heavy motor vehicles, but also on the owners of these vehicles.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 To reiterate, when a strict liability offence involved

"causing" an act that was in itself unlawful, all the prosecution needed to

establish was the causal link, or <i>actus reus</i>. This involved showing that the

accused had some form of control, direction and mandate over the person doing the unlawful

act proper which the accused had exercised: <i>Shavner v Rosner</i> [1954] 2 All ER 280; <i>Mcleod

v Buchanan</i> [1940] 2 All ER 179. Once this was proved, it would then become incumbent

on the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that it had taken all reasonable

care.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Had Tan exercised reasonable care?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 Counsel for Tan submitted that, even if s 79(1) of the Act did

create a strict liability offence, which I ruled that it did, his client had nonetheless

exercised reasonable care and was therefore entitled on that defence to an acquittal. That

there was no unreasonable failure to know the facts that constituted the offence rested on

the following points raised by Counsel:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) In the 1980’s, PSA required road traffic permits for

  containers entering the PSA Container Terminal. It had since ceased enforcing such a

  requirement and therefore Tan’s company had stopped applying for such permits;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) In 1999, one of the company’s prime movers carrying a load of

  the same proportions was stopped, and the company charged for exceeding vehicular weight

  restrictions. The company was not prosecuted for failing to possess a height permit;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Tan had only begun to oversee the company’s business shortly

  before the incident that led to the charge, when his father’s health declined. After

  taking over, Tan had merely carried on the practice of not applying for permits;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The company did not deal with over-heights, which were situations

  where goods extended out of standard containers. Tan knew that these required permits and

  he would let other companies do the job instead;</p>
<p align="justify">(e) Tan’s friends had told him that no permit was required for

  standard containers such as the one that was involved in the present incident;</p>
<p align="justify">(f) The container in question did not belong to Tan’s company and

  Tan did not have the opportunity to see the container for himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 Regrettably, none of the reasons put forward could even come close

to showing that Tan had exercised reasonable care. Tan was effectively the managing

director of a company whose primary business was the provision of transport services for

containerised cargo. He has had some 25 years’ experience in the industry. It was

Tan’s evidence that containers came in standard sizes, and he had applied for height

permits from PSA in the past. As a matter of fact, Tan claimed to be rather ignorant of

the laws governing vehicular height limits. This was also not a situation where he had

circumscribed the nature of his business by limiting the size of containers that he would

accept; neither did he expressly warn his drivers not to accept certain jobs nor ask his

clients about the size of their containers. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Appeal against sentence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 When deciding on a suitable penalty to be imposed, the Court should

not take into account the fact that an accused person had chosen to claim trial instead of

pleading guilty. However, taking into account the culpability of Tan’s conduct, I was

unable to accept Counsel’s submission that the sentence of 14 months’

imprisonment in this instance was manifestly excessive. The district judge had noted that

"the accused failed to take reasonable care, if at all, to ensure that the vehicle

driven by Selamat had a permit … No attempt was made by the accused to check or

confirm the height of the container." Furthermore, Tan’s neglect had indirectly

caused damage to public structures. A catastrophe could have resulted when his prime mover

struck the railway bridge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 The sentence of imprisonment aside, I quashed the order of the

district court disqualifying Tan from holding all classes of driving licence for 12

months. From the grounds of decision, it was apparent that the court had assumed that such

disqualification was mandatory by virtue of s 79(4) of the Act, which stated that

"the driver or person in charge of a heavy motor vehicle convicted of an offence

under subsection (1) or (3) shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to

order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period

of disqualification – (a) in the case of a first offence, be disqualified from

holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than one year." From

the face of this provision, it was clear to me that the mandatory disqualification did not

apply to a charge of "causing" the unlawful user. A power to order

disqualification exists under s 42 of the Act but this is a discretionary power.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 Section 79(1)(a) of the Act made a fine of not more than $2,000

mandatory upon conviction. As the district court had omitted to impose this sentence, I

exercised this Court’s power of revision to impose a fine of $1,000.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37 Having assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the opinion that

there was no merit in the appeal against conviction. Save for the imposition of the $1,000

mandatory fine and the quashing of the disqualification order, I also dismissed the appeal

against sentence.</p>
