<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [name of appellant] are charged that you on the

                        contravention of paragraph 2 of the [MO(PAPPSC)O] and you have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under Section 5(4)(b) of the [MOA].</p>

                        without the prior permission of the Deputy Commissioner of Police in writing
                        in contravention of paragraph 2 of the [MO(PAPPSC)O] and you have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under Section 5(4)(b) of the [MOA].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yap, Dr Chee, CSC and Ghandi had similar antecedents and were
                    each fined $1,000 (in default one week’s imprisonment) on each charge,

                    being imposed on each of them. Tan, Seelan, Chong, Shafi’ie, Go and Jufrie
                    were each fined $900 (in default six days’ imprisonment) on each charge,
                    amounting to a total fine of $1,800 (in default 12 days’ imprisonment)
                    being imposed on each of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       With the exception of Dr Chee and CSC, both
                    of whom withdrew their appeals against conviction and sentence for the Assembly
                    Charge only, as well as Tan, who withdrew his appeal against conviction and
                    sentence for the Procession Charge only, all the other appellants appealed

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 December 2007, Dr Chee made an
                    application on behalf of the Singapore Democratic Party (“SDP”)
                    for a police permit to hold an assembly, described as a “protest
                    rally”, on 15 March 2008 from 2.00pm to 6.00pm at the Parliament House.
                    In a letter dated 25 January 2008, the police informed Dr Chee that
                    the application was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the SDP announced on its
                    official website that it was going ahead with the planned rally. The rally
                    coincided with World Consumer Rights Day, the theme of the rally was “Tak
                    boleh tahan!”, and the attire for the event was “red top”.
                    The public was invited to join the rally to “demonstrate your anger in a
                    peaceful manner” against “the exploitative price hikes of the PAP
                    Government”: see <em>PP v Chee Soon Juan and
                        others</em> [2010] SGDC 259 (“the District
                    Judge’s decision”). Apparently, no application was made for a
                    permit to hold a procession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At about 2.00pm on 15 March 2008, a group
                    of 10–20 people gathered at the driveway in front of Parliament House. The
                    ensuing events were recorded on videotape<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> by Senior Station Inspector Amiruddin
                    Bin Mohamed (PW4). The videotape was screened at the trial and the facts which
                    it revealed, as well as the testimony of Dr Chee at trial, are summarised
                    in the District Judge’s decision at [43] and [46]–[48] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    ... (a) at the start of the protest rally, Ghandi,
                            [Chia Ti Lik (“Chia”)], CSC and [Dr Chee] took turns
                            to address members of the public and the media on the purpose of the
                            assembly; (b) the group displayed common household items, posed for
                            photographs and chanted slogans; (c) when ... placards were delivered in
                            a car by Yong, some of the accused persons went forward immediately to
                            collect the placards; (d) five of the accused persons then stood in a
                            row to pose for photographs with the placards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    ... it was not
                            disputed that the protest rally included a procession from Parliament
                            House to Orchard Road and back. This was mentioned explicitly by
                            [Dr Chee] at the start of the protest rally<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                            ... The undisputed evidence shows that [Dr Chee] had told those
                            present at the start of the protest rally that the group was waiting for
                            the placards to arrive before embarking on the procession.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    In his evidence in court,
                            [Dr Chee] admitted that the procession was intended to spread the
                            message about the “exploitative price hikes” to bystanders
                            and other members of the public along the route. Along the way, the
                            group would be distributing flyers similar to the flyers seized by the
                                police.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    Although
                            the accused persons were leaving the driveway of Parliament House when
                            [DSP William Goh Huat Beng (“DSP Goh”)] approached them
                            [at about 2.31pm to inform them that they were committing the offence of
                            assembly in a gazetted place without a permit and would be arrested if
                            they did not disperse immediately], the objective facts ... show that
                            they did not intend to abandon their planned procession. There were
                            elements in their actions which clearly suggest that they were engaging
                            in a procession in continuation of the protest rally when they set off
                            from the driveway of Parliament House. These include the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeals against conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Whether the District Judge ought to have allowed the
                appellants to question the prosecution witnesses on the constitutionality of the
                rejection of the SDP’s application for a permit to hold the protest
                rally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dr Chee argued that the District Judge
                    had erred in preventing the appellants from questioning the prosecution
                    witnesses on the reasons for the rejection of the SDP’s application for a
                    permit to hold the protest rally. Dr Chee alleged that the decision not to
                    grant the SDP a permit for the protest rally was unconstitutional. The
                    constitutional law arguments which Dr Chee claimed may have afforded the
                    appellants a defence to the charges had they been allowed to pursue this line of
                    questioning revolved around Arts 12 and 14 of the Constitution of the Republic
                    of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Dr Chee pointed to a statement by the
                    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, in
                    Parliament in 2008, <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (28 February 2008) vol 84 at col 1154 which indicated
                    that the police would not grant permits for outdoor political activities.
                    According to Dr Chee, the accused persons had sought, at the trial, to
                    establish with the prosecution witnesses if, at the material time when the
                    SDP’s application to hold the protest rally was being considered, the
                    police had a set of guidelines that was in line with this statement made in
                    Parliament. Dr Chee alleged that if the police had indeed applied a blanket
                    policy to reject applications for permits to hold outdoor political activities,
                    this would have contravened Art 14 of the Constitution. Dr Chee
                    acknowledged that Art 14 of the Constitution does not confer every citizen
                    with an absolute right to the freedom of assembly. However, he claimed that Art
                    14 only provides for the restriction of a citizen’s right to the freedom
                    of assembly under certain conditions, and does not allow the imposition of an
                    outright ban on all outdoor political activities and street
                    demonstrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dr Chee had also wanted to question the
                    licensing officer as to whether the Consumer Association of Singapore
                    (“CASE”) had been given a permit to hold an event in the vicinity
                    of Parliament House on 16 March 2008 (just one day later), and if so, why
                    CASE had been given a permit whereas the SDP’s application for a permit
                    had been rejected. The CASE event involved a campaign to stop the marketing of
                    unhealthy food to children and was held to commemorate World Consumer Rights
                    Day. Dr Chee argued that the police had, in breach of Art 12 of the
                    Constitution, discriminated against the SDP and allowed CASE to hold its event
                    in the same area as the SDP’s protest rally even though the nature of the
                    CASE event and the SDP’s protest rally were similar. Dr Chee referred
                    to a statement made in Parliament by Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee (for the Deputy
                    Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs), <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (27 August 2007) vol
                    83 at col 1338 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the reason why political parties are not allowed to organise outdoor
                        activities has been explained in Parliament before.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The East Coast Park is a recreational park for Singaporeans and their
                        families. It is not meant to be used by a political party to promote its
                        cause. ... As I have explained, Police takes a more cautious approach
                        towards outdoor activities organised by political parties. In line with this
                        approach, Police rejected Workers’ Party’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Chee argued that it is clear from this statement that the
                    executive has placed a sweeping ban on outdoor political activities.
                    Dr Chee submitted that the imposition of such a ban was harsh, arbitrary,
                    disproportionate and inconsistent with the rule of law. Yap added that Assoc
                    Prof Ho had also stated that the policy not to allow political parties to
                    organise outdoor activities applied to “all political parties”. He
                    argued that this blanket ban discriminated against political parties and was
                    unlawful. I note that the appellants’ arguments were directed at the
                    legality of the policy against outdoor political activities and <em>not</em> the validity of the requirement, in the MO(PAPPSC)O,
                    that a permit be granted before one can participate in an assembly and/or a
                    procession to which the MO(PAPPSC)O applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The District Judge, citing the reasoning of
                    the High Court in <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v PP and another
                        appeal</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 419 (“<em>Jeyaretnam v PP</em>”), had disallowed the appellants’
                    line of questions concerning the issues discussed in <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above on the
                    ground that the appellants’ contentions were incapable of forming any
                    defence at law to the charges which they faced (see [62] – [66] of the
                    District Judge’s decision). In summary, the District Judge reasoned that
                    if the licensing officer’s decision was invalid, this would not alter the
                    fact that the appellants had no permit when they held the protest rally and
                    would still be convicted of participating in an assembly and a procession
                    without a valid permit. Any question pertaining to the reason for the rejection
                    of their application for the permit was completely irrelevant to the criminal
                    proceedings. I agree with the District Judge and adopt his
                reasoning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It was not the appellants’ case that the
                    MOA or the MO(PAPPSC)O was in itself unconstitutional. Instead, the appellants
                    were attacking the manner in which the discretion conferred by paragraph 2 of
                    the MO(PAPPSC)O on the police to grant permits for assemblies and processions
                    had been exercised. The basic proposition in judicial review is that the court
                    will not question the merits of an exercise of discretion and cannot substitute
                    its own view as to how the discretion should be exercised with that actually
                    taken. As Chan Sek Keong J pointed out in <em>Jeyaretnam v
                        PP</em> at [26], a case
                    concerning the conviction of two appellants under s 18(1)(a) of the then Public
                    Entertainments Act (Cap 257, 1985 Rev Ed) for providing public
                    entertainment without a licence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The soundness of the first appellant’s
                            submission may be tested by assuming that the licensing officer
                            wrongfully refused the licence. What were his legal rights? The court
                            would have quashed the decision if the appellants had commenced
                            proceedings for judicial review. The licensing officer would then have
                            to consider the application afresh. If he refused, the court would have
                            the power to direct him to do so. But, the court would not have been
                            able to grant a licence to the first appellant or direct the licensing
                            officer to do so, as the power of court is exercisable by way of
                            supervisory jurisdiction in these matters. Therefore, the invalidity of
                            the decision of the licensing officer would result in nothing more than
                            the appellants’
                            <em>status quo ante</em> the application. <em>They would still have had no licence when they provided the
                                public entertainment</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even if the rejection of the SDP’s application for a permit
                    to hold the protest rally and the policy prohibiting outdoor political
                    activities were unconstitutional in the present case, neither the District Court
                    nor this court would be able to grant the appellants a permit. All that the
                    District Court and this court could/can do would be to direct the licensing
                    officer to consider the application afresh. The District Judge was therefore
                    correct to refuse the appellants’ line of questions at trial relating to
                    the constitutionality of the rejection of the SDP’s application for a
                    permit to hold the rally since the constitutionality or otherwise of this
                    decision was irrelevant to the issue of whether the appellants ought to have
                    been convicted for having participated in an assembly and a procession without a
                    valid permit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Dr Chee sought to distinguish the
                    decision in <em>Jeyaretnam v PP</em> on the ground that
                    there had been no statement made in Parliament, as at the date of the offence in
                        <em>Jeyaretnam v PP</em>, that no permits would be
                    given for outdoor political demonstrations, unlike in the present case (as
                    discussed at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). However, as pointed out at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above, the existence of a policy
                    against outdoor political activities is irrelevant to the issue of whether the
                    appellants have breached the MOA by contravening the MO(PAPPSC)O in the present
                    case. The reasoning in <em>Jeyaretnam v PP</em> applies
                    regardless of whether an exercise of discretion not to grant a permit or a
                    policy not to grant permits to a particular class of people is being challenged.
                    Dr Chee further claimed that a judicial review action would be pointless
                    because the Deputy Commissioner of Police would still arrive at the same
                    decision (due to the policy against outdoor political activities) even if he
                    were ordered to consider the SDP’s application for a permit afresh. In
                    this regard, it should be noted that the function of judicial review is for the
                    court to ensure that decision-makers exercising public power act in accordance
                    with law, fairly and reasonably. Should the court, in a judicial review action,
                    find that the application of the policy against outdoor political activities is
                    unlawful, the Deputy Commissioner of Police would have to reconsider the
                    SDP’s application of the permit without applying such a
                policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dr Chee referred me to the case of
                        <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin &amp; Ors v PP</em> [1994]
                    3 SLR(R) 209 (“<em>Colin v
                    PP</em>”). This case was cited at [66] of the District
                    Judge’s decision in the present case, where the District Judge commented
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    If the accused persons were aggrieved by the
                            decision of SI Yeo in rejecting their application for a permit, they
                            were at liberty to apply for a judicial review of that decision before
                            the High Court. As held in [<em>Colin v PP</em>],
                            there is no provision in the Subordinate Courts Act, Chapter 321 which
                            is equivalent to paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court
                            of Judicature Act, Chapter 322, which conferred upon the High Court the
                            power of judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In <em>Colin v PP</em>,
                    the High Court referred to the observations of Woolf LJ in <em>Bugg v Director of Public Prosecutions</em> [1993]
                    2 WLR 628 (“<em>Bugg</em>”) and
                    stated that whilst a criminal court had jurisdiction to consider a defence
                    alleging that a subsidiary legislation was substantively invalid (<em>ie</em>, on its face invalid because it was <em>ultra vires</em> its enabling act or it was patently
                    unreasonable), it could not consider whether a subsidiary legislation was
                    procedurally invalid (<em>ie</em>, there had been
                    non-compliance with a procedural requirement with regard to the making of that
                    subsidiary legislation). Yong Pung How CJ noted that Woolf LJ had
                    offered two explanations for the distinction between substantive invalidity and
                    procedural invalidity. First, a criminal court could not inquire into
                    allegations of procedural invalidity because it was not part of its jurisdiction
                    to do so and a criminal court was not properly equipped to carry out the
                    necessary investigation. Second, the evidence with respect to a particular
                    allegation of procedural invalidity was highly significant and may result in
                    differing outcomes in proceedings whereas there was no need for evidence to
                    establish substantive invalidity. In the circumstances, Yong CJ stated that
                    subsidiary legislation which was alleged to be procedurally invalid must be set
                    aside by the appropriate court with the jurisdiction to do so (<em>ie</em>, the High Court) and should not be challenged in
                    subordinate court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As Dr Chee pointed out, the House of
                    Lords in <em>Boddington v British Transport Police</em>
                    [1998] 2 WLR 639 (“<em>Boddington</em>”) has overruled <em>Bugg</em>. Dr Chee also referred to the English Divisional Court
                    decision in <em>R (on the application of Gillan) v Commissioner
                        of Police of the Metropolis</em> [2003] Po LR 397 for the
                    proposition that courts have the power to examine the way in which public
                    servants use discretionary powers given to them under a statutory regime. In
                        <em>Boddington</em>, the House of Lords held that,
                    subject to statutory limitation of a defendant’s right to call the
                    legality of an administrative act into question, it was open to a defendant to
                    challenge the validity of a byelaw or an administrative act undertaken pursuant
                    to it in any court in which he was being tried and that the defendant committed
                    no crime if he had infringed an invalid byelaw. Lord Slynn commented in
                        <em>Boddington</em> that “an application for
                    judicial review is not a straitjacket which must be put on before rights can be
                    asserted”. The reasons given by their Lordships for their decision were,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     the distinction between orders which
                        were substantively invalid and orders which were procedurally invalid was
                        not a practical distinction which was capable of being maintained in a
                        principled way across the broad range of administrative action. The
                        difficulty of drawing this distinction would undermine the constitutional
                        principle that a clear distinction had to be made between lawful and
                        unlawful acts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     the pragmatic case in favour of a rule that magistrates may not decide
                        issues of procedural validity was questionable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the judgment in <em>Bugg</em> in effect denied the right of defensive challenge in a
                        criminal case and was contrary to established judicial review principles
                        laid down by decisions of high authority; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     it was not a realistic or satisfactory riposte
                        that defendants could always go by way of a judicial review. The possibility
                        of judicial review might not compensate a defendant for his loss of the
                        right to defend himself by a defensive challenge to a byelaw in cases where
                        the invalidity of the byelaw might afford him with a defence to the charge
                        as the defendant may either:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       be out of time with regards
                            to an application for judicial review proceedings before he became aware
                            of the existence of the byelaw;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       lack the resources to defend his interests in
                            two courts;</p>

                            review;</p>

                            Divisional Court restricted at a substantive hearing;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       be
                            denied a remedy on a discretionary basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The reasoning in <em>Boddington</em> represents a notable development in English law but
                    has not yet been adopted by the courts in Singapore. The issue of whether, and
                    in what circumstances, allegations of procedural invalidity may be raised as a
                    defence in criminal proceedings deserves detailed consideration and I prefer to
                    express no view at this stage on this point since, as discussed at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, the issue has no bearing on the
                    appellants’ convictions and sentences in the present case. The law
                    relating to offences under s 5(4)(b) of the MOA read with paragraph 2 of the
                    MO(PAPPSC)O was not that the appellants could participate in the assembly and
                    procession without a permit subject to such restrictions as may be imposed or
                    directions as may be given by the police. If this had indeed been the case, then
                    if such restrictions or directions were wrongly imposed, that might have
                    afforded a valid defence to the appellants subject to the consideration of the
                    issue of whether the judicial review claim could have been brought as a defence
                    in criminal proceedings before the District Judge. To the contrary, paragraph 2
                    of the MO(PAPPSC)O required the appellants to obtain the prior permission of the
                    Deputy Commissioner of Police in writing before they could hold the assembly and
                    procession which were the subject of the charges in the present appeal. Section
                    5(4)(b) of the MOA made any contravention of the MO(PAPPSC)O an offence. Since
                    the appellants did not have a permit when they participated in the assembly and
                    procession, they were rightly convicted and sentenced under s 5(4)(b) of the MOA
                    regardless of the constitutionality of the rejection of their application for a
                    permit to hold the protest rally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Yap has sought to rely on the dicta of
                    Woolf LJ in <em>Bugg</em> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[w]here the law is substantively invalid ... [n]o citizen is required to
                        comply with a law which is bad on its face. If the citizen is satisfied that
                        that is the situation, he is entitled to ignore the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since the appellants have not argued that the MOA or the MO(PAPPSC)O
                    is invalid, this dicta cannot apply in the present case and I express no view on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the hearing on 4 October 2010, Jufrie
                    submitted that the arrest of the appellants was unconstitutional. According to
                    Jufrie, the appellants were peacefully exercising their constitutional rights to
                    freedom of speech and assembly and ought not to have been penalised. Apart from
                    his statement that it was totally illogical that one was not allowed to gather
                    peacefully no matter where, Jufrie did not elaborate further on what he meant by
                    his submission that the Government should not be allowed to pass laws that
                    contravene the Constitution. Section 5(4)(b) of the MOA and paragraph 2 of the
                    MO(PAPPSC)O do not absolutely prohibit peaceful gatherings. Rather, the
                    legislation require persons who wish to partake in assemblies and processions
                    within the purview of the legislation to first obtain the permission of the
                    Deputy Commissioner of Police in writing. Ultimately, Jufrie’s argument
                    boiled down to an attack on the rejection of the SDP’s application for a
                    permit to hold the protest rally. As discussed above (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>–<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> and <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>), the merits
                    of such an argument would not affect the appellants’ conviction and
                    sentence in the present case. In any event, I note that Rajah JA has observed,
                    in <em>Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and
                        another</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [41]–[56] that Art
                    14 of the Constitution allows Parliament an extremely wide discretionary power
                    and remit to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights of freedom of speech and
                    expression and assembly if it considers such restrictions necessary or expedient
                    in the interest of the security of Singapore or public order. Rajah JA held that
                    there can be no challenge as such to the constitutionality of the MOA since
                    Parliament has considered and has intended through the MOA to impose
                    restrictions on the freedom of speech and/or assembly that are “necessary
                    or expedient” to ensure public order in certain situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Whether the MO(PAPPSC)O was erroneous and invalid </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Schedule to the version of the MO(PAPPSC)O
                    in force on 15 March 2008 is set out at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Yap submitted that there were three mistakes
                    in this description of area in the Schedule. First, the Schedule referred to Old
                    Parliament Lane as Parliament Lane. Second, the Schedule referred to the left
                    bank of the Singapore River whereas the Schedule in the 2008 revised version of
                    the MO(PAPPSC)O referred to the east bank of the Singapore River. Third, Yap
                    claimed that Old Parliament Lane did not connect with the east bank of the
                    Singapore River such that there was an unaccounted gap in the area described in
                    the Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With regard to the first mistake raised by
                    Yap, it was not disputed that on 15 March 2008, there was no street by the name
                    of “Parliament Lane”. “Parliament Lane” had been
                    renamed as “Old Parliament Lane” on 28 July 1999 for historical
                    reasons without any physical change to the street in question such that
                    “Parliament Lane” and “Old Parliament Lane” referred
                    to the exact same physical street. However, “Old Parliament Lane”
                    was erroneously referred to as “Parliament Lane” when the
                    MO(PAPPSC)O was first enacted in 2002 and in its 2005 revised version.
                    Amendments made to the MO(PAPPSC)O in 2008 (but after 15 March 2008) finally
                    corrected this error (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). I agree
                    with the District Judge’s decision that it is evident that the reference
                    to “Parliament Lane” in the description of area was intended to be
                    a reference to the physical street which had been renamed “Old Parliament
                    Lane” and that a purposive approach to the interpretation of the
                    description of area in the Schedule of the MO(PAPPSC)O should be applied such
                    that the driveway leading to the main entrance of the Parliament House was
                    clearly within the area described in the Schedule to the Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Whilst the reference to the “left
                    bank” of the Singapore River in the original version of the MO(PAPPSC)O
                    and the amended version of the MO(PAPPSC)O which was in force on 15 March
                    2008 was subsequently changed to the “east bank” of the Singapore
                    River when the MO(PAPPSC)O was amended in 2008, it is clear that the Schedule of
                    all versions of the MO(PAPPSC)O referred to the same point of the Singapore
                    River, regardless of whether this was labelled as the “left bank”
                    or the “east bank” of the Singapore River.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Yap’s third complaint was that a portion
                    of Old Parliament Lane had been abolished such that a portion of Old Parliament
                    Lane that used to connect to the bank of the Singapore River had been converted
                    into a promenade for pedestrians. The DPP, on the other hand, argued that the
                    portion of Old Parliament Lane that had been converted into a promenade was a
                    pedestrianised road. The DPP, relying on the testimony at trial of Mdm Ng Soh
                    Hoon (PW7) further argued that the names of public roads do not necessarily
                    apply only to vehicular roads – they can also apply to pedestrianised
                        roads.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Mdm Ng had
                    assisted the Secretary of the Advisory Committee on Street Building and Estate
                    Names (“ACOSBEN”) from March 1996 and continued to assist the
                    Secretary of the Street and Building Names Board when it replaced the ACOSBEN on
                    1 January 2003. Paragraph 2 of the MO(PAPPSC)O provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    No person shall hold any assembly or procession ...
                            consisting of 2 or more persons –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    in any ... public place ... <em>within the area</em> described in the Schedule;

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">unless he has obtained the prior permission of the Deputy Commissioner of

<p class="Judg-1">Regardless of whether there was a gap between Old Parliament Lane and
                    the bank of the Singapore River in the area described in the Schedule, I am of
                    the opinion that the driveway leading to the main entrance of Parliament House
                    clearly fell <em>within</em> the area described in the
                    Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At the hearing on 4 October 2010, Yap claimed
                    that there were no signs at Parliament House to warn the public that assemblies
                    and processions were not allowed within the gazetted area if no permits had been
                    granted for such assemblies and processions. However, he did not make any
                    submission on the District Judge’s findings (at [68]–[72] of the
                    District Judge’s decision) that there was overwhelming evidence to
                    indicate that each and every one of the accused persons had actual knowledge
                    that the protest rally was being held without the requisite permit. The District
                    Judge held that it was undisputed that Dr Chee had actual knowledge that
                    the SDP did not have the requisite permit to hold the protest rally and that
                    there was incontrovertible evidence (<em>eg</em>, Yap had
                    admitted that he did not expect the SDP to be granted a permit for the protest
                    rally and Yap had professed his intention to film the “unreasonable
                    enforcement” of the police) which suggested, at the very least, that Yap
                    ought reasonably to have known that the assembly and procession were held
                    without a permit. The District Judge also listed (at [70] of his decision) the
                    evidence which suggested that the rest of the appellants knew that the assembly
                    and procession were held without the requisite permit: (a) the SDP had
                    publicised extensively their correspondence with the police and Minister for
                    Home Affairs with regard to the rejection of their appeal for a permit to hold
                    the protest rally on their official website; (b) the SDP had publicised the fact
                    that despite the rejection the SDP would go ahead with the planned rally; (c)
                    none of the accused persons expressed any surprise or alarm at
                    Dr Chee’s statements at the protest rally that the police had allowed
                    the CASE event to proceed but not the SDP’s protest rally; and (d) the
                    accused persons did not show any surprise or alarm when DSP Goh approached the
                    group. Even if there were no warning signs within the gazetted area, the
                    evidence shows that the appellants were aware of the need for a permit for the
                    protest rally as well as the fact that such a permit had not been
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Whether the District Judge had erred in determining the
                facts as regards Yap’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to Yap, he had attended the event on
                    15 March 2008 as a citizen journalist with the rest of the media and had walked
                    about on his own, taking videos for his blog. Yap claimed that he was not part
                    of the assembly and procession as he did not wear the same red t-shirt
                    emblazoned with the words “TAK BOLEH TAHAN” as the other accused
                    persons. He also said that he did not distribute flyers, give a speech,
                    participate in the group photograph taking or yell slogans at the rally. Yap
                    further claimed that he had not participated in the procession but had taken a
                    different route and had only rejoined the group when he noticed DSP Goh
                    approaching Dr Chee and the rest of the group. Whilst Yap acknowledged that
                    he had yelled “Let’s march”, he claimed to have done so only
                    after the procession had already been stopped by the police. These arguments
                    were raised before the District Judge at the trial (see [32] – [40] of the District
                    Judge’s decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Ng Chye Huay v
                        PP</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 157, Yong CJ noted that it is
                    not necessary for every member of an assembly to be engaged in the exact same
                    activities as long as they share the common object which identifies them as part
                    of the group. I agree with the District Judge that, on the totality of the
                    evidence, Yap shared an <em>esprit de corps</em> with the
                    participants of the protest rally and was acting in concert with the group
                    during the assembly and the procession (see [51]–[52] of the District
                    Judge’s decision). While Yap sought to distance himself from the others in
                    his arguments, he did not address the findings made by the District
                    Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there had been a miscarriage of justice caused by the joint
                trial of all accused persons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Although not argued before me, the issue of
                    whether there had been a miscarriage of justice caused by the joint trial of all
                    accused persons was raised in Yap’s petition of appeal. Section 176 of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) allows a joint trial where
                    more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences
                    committed in the same transaction. In this case, 19 of the accused persons faced
                    a first charge for participating in the same assembly on 15 March 2008 and 18 of
                    these 19 accused persons also faced a second charge for participating in the
                    same procession without a permit. The assembly and procession were alleged to
                    have been committed on the same occasion. The joint trial of 18 of the accused
                    persons (one accused person pleaded guilty on the first day of trial) was
                    therefore appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeals against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The prescribed punishment for the offences of
                    assembly and procession is a fine not exceeding $1,000 each. As noted at
                        <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above, the appellants with prior
                    antecedents were ordered to pay the maximum fine (in default, one week’s
                    imprisonment) per charge whereas the appellants without prior antecedents were
                    ordered to pay a fine of $900 (in default, six days’ imprisonment) per
                    charge. Although the appeals were against both convictions and sentence, the
                    appellants did not make any submission on sentence. Taking into consideration
                    the fact that the appellants had deliberately planned to break the law and the
                    absence of any regret by any of them for breaking the law, I am of the view that
                    the sentence imposed on each appellant by the District Judge is not manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The appeals against conviction and sentence
                    are dismissed.</p>
