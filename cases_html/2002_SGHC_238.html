        By order of Court of 14 June 2001 Suit No 147

of 2000 and Suit No 371 of 2001 were consolidated, and they were tried before me. At the

end of the trial and after hearing submissions from counsel, I reserved judgment on 4

October 2002. I now give my judgment and the written grounds thereof.</font>

        The actions were brought by the Plaintiffs

under s 67 of the Patents Act ("the Act") in respect of the following patents

("the Patents") granted by the Registry of Patents, Singapore:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) Patent No 47151, granted on

    17 August 1999 ("60169 Patent").</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The Patents are both in respect of spectacle

frames, comprising a primary and an auxiliary frame. The primary frame is for housing

prescription lenses while the auxiliary frame is for tinted lenses. The latter is widely

known as clip-on sunglasses. The inventions comprised in the Patents are the methods by

which the auxiliary frame is attached to the primary frame. In both Patents, magnets are

used for this purpose. In the 47151 Patent, a pair of magnets is mounted in the temple

area of the primary frame near the hinges and a second pair is mounted in the

corresponding area of the auxiliary frame. This will be referred to as the temple-mounted

frame. In the 60169 Patent, one or two magnets are mounted on the bridge of the primary

frame and the corresponding number of magnets are mounted on the bridge of the auxiliary

frame. This will be referred to as the bridge-mounted frame.</font></p>

        Against the respective Defendants the

Plaintiffs claim the following relief:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) a declaration that the

    Patents are valid and that they have been infringed by the respective Defendants;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The Defendants dispute (i) that the Patents are

valid; and (ii) that the Patents have been infringed. Furthermore, in respect of the 47151

Patent, Pearl’s Optical and Peng Lian claim that at the time of the alleged

infringement they were not aware, and had no reasonable grounds for supposing, that the

Patent existed and therefore, pursuant to s 69(1) of the Act, the Plaintiffs are not

entitled to damages or an account of profits. In addition, all the Defendants, except for

Peng Lian, do not admit the fact of sale of the items as claimed by the Plaintiffs.

Finally in respect of both Patents, the Defendants claim relief under s 75 of the Act.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        In the case of Peng Lian, it is pleaded in

their Defence, at the third sentence of paragraph 2, that the Particulars of Infringement

at paragraphs 8 and 10 are admitted. The relevant part of paragraph 2 of Peng Lian's

Defence states as follows (emphasis added):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… It is admitted that [Peng

    Lian] is the distributor of the article referred to in the affidavit of Yo Peng Sia filed

    on 17 May 2000. Paragraph 8 and 10 of the Particulars of Infringement <u>are admitted</u>.

    …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Paragraphs 8 and 10 of the

Particulars of Infringement, which relate to the 60169 Patent, provide as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8. [Peng Lian] has, without the

    Plaintiffs’ consent, infringed claim 1 or, alternatively, claim 2 of the 60169 Patent

    invention. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10. [Peng Lian] has since

    admitted to being the distributor of the article shown in the affidavit of Yo Peng Sia

    filed in this action on 17 May 2000.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yo Peng Sia ("Yo") is

the proprietor of Peng Lian and the relevant passage in his affidavit of 17 May 2000 is

found in paragraph 2 which states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have reviewed the Statement of

    Claim filed under these proceedings and I have also reviewed the photographs taken by the

    Defendant’s solicitor of the alleged infringing article referred to in paragraph

    5b(i) of the said Statement of Claim. Annexed and marked "YPS-1" is a copy of

    the said photographs and I confirm that [Peng Lian] is the distributor of the alleged

    infringing article.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        On the last day of the trial, after counsel

have completed their submissions, counsel for Peng Lian applied for leave to amend

paragraph 2 of the Defence by inserting the word "not" so that the words

underlined above would read "are not admitted". This would have the effect of

completely reversing the admission in that sentence. The Plaintiffs objected in no

uncertain terms. Counsel for Peng Lian said that it was a typographical error. Be that as

it may, it would have meant that the relevant witnesses would have to be recalled in order

to give the Plaintiffs an opportunity to prove those particulars of infringement,

something they had not done on account of the admission. This application being made at

the end of 15 days of trial and submissions, which if allowed would entail further

evidence to be adduced, I did not think that I should exercise my discretion to give

leave. Counsel for Peng Lian later argued that paragraph 2 of the Defence contains a

denial of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim which states as follows;</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 2nd Defendant has infringed

    and threatens and intends, unless restrained by this Honourable Court, to continue to

    infringe the Patents in the manner appearing in the Particulars of Infringement served

    herewith.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However in my view the admission

made above is not affected by this denial. From the pleadings set out above, I hold that

what Peng Lian have admitted to are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) they have infringed claim 1

    or claim 2 of the 60169 Patent (if valid); and</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        Richard Chao is named in the Patents as the

inventor of the two inventions therein. He deposed that he had been in the eyewear

business for about twenty years. He was responsible for the accounts and personnel matters

for the Contour Optik. He had recently taken on the responsibility of overseeing sales in

Taiwan. In the course of his employment he had, from time to time, been involved with the

production of eyewear. He said that although he was never in charge of production and had

never actually produced an eyewear with his own hands, he was fairly familiar with the

production process.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        Richard Chao said that around the second half

of 1994, Contour Optik were making and selling magnetic frames, which were front-mounted.

These front-mounted frames had magnets embedded at the left and right arms of the main

frame and facing outwards, away from the face. The auxiliary frame had magnets embedded at

the corresponding arms that faced inwards. The auxiliary frame was attached to the main

frame by the attractive force of the magnets on the main and auxiliary frames. Contour

Optik received feedback from their customers that the auxiliary frames of this design

would frequently come off when the user engaged in physical activities like jogging or

running. Some even complained that the cavities in the arms of the main frame for housing

the magnets made the arms weak and vulnerable to breaking. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Richard Chao said that sometime in August or

September 1994, the idea of placing the magnets in a top-down fashion at the temporal

portions came to his mind. He told his brother, David Chao, who is in charge of sales and

product design of this idea. David Chao thought that it was very promising. Richard Chao

then met with the design and production staff to turn his idea into reality. He recalled

that they discussed the problem associated with making cavities in the frames for housing

the magnets. This was more problematic for the arms of the main frame than of the

auxiliary frame because the main frame is often subjected to great stress when the

optician or optometrist bends it to fit the user’s face. Richard Chao said that he

came up with the idea of making a separate piece for housing the magnets and soldering

this piece to the arms of the main frame to avoid this problem. He also told the staff to

make the housing for the magnets lower than the arms of the main frame and the arms or the

magnets on the auxiliary frame extended slightly downward so that the auxiliary frame may

be supported on the main frame. Richard Chao said that some months later David Chao and

the staff produced a workable prototype. But it was much later before the Contour Optik

were able to deliver the finished product to the customers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        In respect of the invention in the 60169

Patent, Richard Chao said that shortly after the temple-mounted frames were sold, they

realised that the product was not designed to cater to situations where the user wished to

take off the auxiliary frame with one hand, for example when the user is driving or

carrying something with the other hand. The temple-mounted frames required the use of both

hands to properly attach and remove the auxiliary frame. Richard Chao figured that this

stemmed from the fact that the magnets were placed too far apart. He reasoned that if the

magnets were placed closer together, the user needed only one hand to lift off and place

the auxiliary frame. He considered placing the magnets closer together by placing them on

the bridge.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        Richard Chao told David Chao of this new idea.

David’s initial response was that he did not think that it was possible at all

because he felt that the area at top of the bridge was too narrow to place any magnet. But

after considering the idea further with the staff, they agreed that it was feasible. In

one of the discussions, Richard Chao told them the idea of placing a magnet on just one

side with a magnetizable substance on the other to reduce the costs of production. The

final result was a magnetic frame that was top mounted at the bridge portion.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        Richard Chao said that David Chao took care of

the patent filing of the two inventions. He said that in both cases David Chao showed him

the drawings and the specifications before filing them and he was satisfied that the

drawings and specifications covered the two inventions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        David Chao is also a Director of Contour Optik

and has been in the eyewear business since about 1985. He is based in the United States

and in charge of sales and product design. He is also in charge of patent filings for

Contour Optik.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        David Chao corroborated the evidence of Richard

Chao in relation to the events leading to the inventions in the Patents. He elaborated

that it took a long time from conception to shipment because there was a boom for normal

metallic from 1994 to 1996 and the machinery and staff were fully occupied in meeting the

orders. Contour Optik was then about nine to twelve months behind their delivery schedule.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        David Chao deposed that around October 1995 he

arranged for a patent in respect of the temple-mounted frame to be filed in the United

States. On 7 November 1995, Patent Application No 08/554,854 was filed in Richard

Chao’s name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The application was

granted on 22 October 1996 and issued as US Patent No 5,568,207. Subsequently, David Chao

instructed their patent agents in Taiwan to apply for patent protection for that invention

in various countries. In Singapore, an application was filed on 10 June 1996 and the 47151

Patent was granted on 16 November 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        As for the bridge-mounted frame, David Chao

arranged for patent applications to be filed first in the United States and subsequently

in other countries including Canada and Singapore. On 13 December 1996, a US application

in respect of the bridge-mounted invention was filed in Richard Chao’s name. The US

054 Patent was granted on 7 April 1998. On 11 December 1997, an application for the

bridge-mounted invention was filed in Singapore and the 60169 Patent was granted on 17

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… an invention for a patent

    … shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be taken to be that specified in a

    claim of the specification of the … patent … as interpreted by the description

    conferred by a patent ... shall be determined accordingly.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Counsel agree that this means

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        In construing the invention for a patent, the

Court adopts a purposive approach in favour of a literal one – <i>per</i> Lord

Diplock in <i>Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd</i> <nobr>[1982] RPC 183</nobr> at p 242:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… a patent specification is

    a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those

    likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e.

    "skilled in the art"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the

    essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a

    monopoly. It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute

    the so-called "pith and marrow" of the claim. A patent specification should be

    given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying it

    to the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their

    training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical

    knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be

    used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase

    appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the

    invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it

    could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        However this approach does not allow one to

incorporate features from the description or drawings that are omitted from the claims. It

is not meant to fill gaps in the claims. In <i>Bean Innovations Pte Ltd &amp; Anor v

Flexon (Pte) Ltd </i><nobr>[2001] 3 SLR 121</nobr>, the Court of Appeal set out the limitations to the

purposive approach at paragraph 27:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27 We should add that the

    well-known principle that patent claims are to be given a purposive construction does not

    mean that the court in construing a claim is entitled to disregard the clear and

    unambiguous words used to describe the essential features of a claim. In <i>Socit

    Technique de Pulverisation STEP v Emson Europe</i> <nobr>[1993] RPC 513</nobr> at 522, Hoffmann LJ

    said:</font></p>

      concept. It may have some other purpose buried in the prior art and even if this is not

      discernible, the patentee may have had some reason of his own for introducing it …</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Laddie J in <i>Brugger v Medicaid</i>
<nobr>[1996] RPC 635</nobr> at 649, having referred to the preceding case quoted above, said:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The warning in STEP v Emson cited

      above has particular relevance here. If a patentee has chosen to define the characterising

      part of his claim in narrow terms it is not for the court to rewrite it in broader

      language simply because it thinks a wider form of wording would have been easy to

      formulate.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Even adopting a purposive

    construction, one cannot write words into a claim that are not there or give a meaning to

    a term of a claim that is contrary to its language. A caution against blurring the

    purposive construction approach and the re-writing of a claim was given by Graham J in <i>Rotocrop

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The question of equivalence and

      pith and marrow of course only arises in doubtful cases. The authorities establish that if

      it is clear from the description and claims as a whole that a particular feature is

      claimed as and must be regarded as essential to the invention, then that is an end of the

      matter. Either the defendant has taken it or he has not and accordingly he has infringed

        In <i>Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd</i>
<nobr>[2001] RPC 133</nobr>, Aldous LJ set out the proper approach to the construction of a patent

under English law:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19 … The correct approach is

    to achieve a position between those extremes which combines a fair protection for the

    patentee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20 Strict literal interpretation

    using the drawings and specification gives to third parties the most certainty. That has

    always been seen as being unfair to inventors and of course is outlawed by the Protocol.

    However, there must be a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties and therefore

    the language of the claim as interpreted in light of the drawings and specification cannot

    be disregarded. As pointed out by Hoffman LJ in <i>Socit Technique de Pulverisation

    Step v Emson Europe Ltd</i> <nobr>[1993] RPC 513</nobr> at 522 an integer of a claim cannot be just

    struck out because it does not make any difference to the inventive concept. It may have

    been inserted by the patentee for some reason.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21 So far as the patentee is

    concerned it is important that the claim should be interpreted in accordance with his

    intention. A claim interpreted, on the one hand, too liberally can render the patent

    invalid and, on the other, too literally can allow third parties to avoid the monopoly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22 The object of interpretation

    is to ascertain the intention of the author, in this case the patentee. This involves

    examining the words of the claim through the eyes of a person to whom the specification is

    directed, in the context of the specification as a whole. If the reader skilled in the art

    would have understood that the patentee intended that the claim should have a particular

    ambit, then to construe it as not confined to that ambit, either by strict or liberal

    construction, would be unfair to the patentee. It is the patentee that chooses the words

    and to widen the ambit contrary to his intention could invalidate the patent and to

    restrict the ambit could allow the use of the invention without payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23 As the task of the court is to

    ascertain objectively what meaning the words were intended to convey, the <i>Improver</i>

    questions, better called the Protocol questions, were proposed as an aid. It is reasonable

    to infer, absent words to the contrary, that the patentee intended to include within his

    monopoly what can be termed immaterial variants, in the sense that they were not material

    to the way the invention worked. Also it is reasonable to infer that a patentee did not

    intend to include within the ambit of his monopoly a variant which had a material effect

    upon the way the invention worked, otherwise his claims could, to the detriment of the

    patentee, include variants which had little if anything to do with what he had invented.

    However, third parties have to be considered and, therefore, they should not be held to

    infringe if it was clear that such a variant was not intended to be within the ambit of

    the monopoly, either because of the words chosen or because it would be seen to have

    materially affected the way the invention worked.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        The monopoly of a patent is found in the claims

of the specification. There is no infringement if the invention in dispute does not fall

within the integers of the claims. In <i>Electric and Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1939] 56 RPC 23</nobr> Lord Russell said at p 39:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    The function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed,

    so that others may know the exact boundaries of the area within which they will be

    trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not

    claimed is disclaimed. The claims must undoubtedly be read as part of the entire document,

    and not as a separate document; but the forbidden field must be found in the language of

    claims and not elsewhere. It is not permissible, in my opinion, by reference to some

    language used in the earlier part of the specification, to change a claim which by its own

    language is a claim for one subject-matter into a claim for another and a different

    subject-matter, which is what you do when you alter the boundaries of the forbidden

    territory. A patentee who describes an invention in the body of a specification obtains no

    monopoly unless it is claimed in the claims. As Lord Cairns said, there is no such thing

    as infringement of the equity of a patent (<i>Dudgeon v Thomson</i> LR 3 App Cas 34).</font></p>

    question whether the patentee’s claim is new for the purposes of section 32(1)(e)

        The Defendants’ expert witness, Takashi

Tega ("Tega"), said that the Pentax Twincome ("the Twincome") frame

was sold in Japan before June 1996. But he did not have a sample of the model sold during

that period. What he had was a copy of the newspaper "Nihon Kogyo Shinbun"

published on 15 December 1995 which shows a photograph of part of the Twincome frame and

an accompanying description of the frame.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        The Plaintiffs concede that the Twincome

anticipates the first inventive concept, i.e. top-down attachment of the magnets at the

temporal positions of the frames. But they dispute that the Twincome anticipates the

second inventive concept, i.e. the use of separate projections for housing the magnets at

the primary frame that are secured to the frame. It is not completely clear from the

photograph of the Twincome whether this is the case. The accompanying description is of no

assistance. Tega said that he was 70% to 80% certain that the projection in the Twincome

is a separate housing secured to the main frame. The same opinion was held by another of

the Defendants’ expert witnesses, Lee Byung-Chang ("Lee"). They both

reasoned that this was apparent to them from the construction of the arm and leg and the

fact that the hinge appeared to be welded to arm and leg. The Plaintiffs’ experts did

not give evidence on this point. I should add that the Defendants exhibited the current

model of the Twincome (exhibit 1DE) in which the hinge is quite different from the model

in the 1995 picture. The hinge in the current model is not welded to the arm and leg and

the projection is also not welded to the arm. This supports the Defendants’ position.

I am of the view that Tega and Lee’s evidence are reasonable and since they have not

been rebutted, I hold on a balance of probability that the projection in Twincome has

projections that are welded to the frame. Accordingly the second inventive concept in the

47151 Patent has been anticipated by the Twincome.</font></p>

        It is not an inventive step if the alleged

invention is merely a new use of a known contrivance or method. In <i>Hamilton E. Harwood

and another v Director of Great Northern Railway Company </i><nobr>[1865] 11 ER 1488</nobr>, the

patentee used a "fish plate" for joining together the ends of rails. The

evidence showed that this particular form of joint had been applied in various mechanical

contrivances and notably in the joining together of pieces of timber used in bridge

building, but not exactly the same kind of strains were involved. The court held that such

use of a known contrivance cannot be considered as inventive. The reason why patent law is

reluctant to give protection in such cases is explained by Lord Westbury LC as follows (at

p 1499):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… the question is, whether

    there can be any invention of the Plaintiff in having taken that thing which was a fish

    is well and rightly settled, for there would be no end to the interference with trade, and

    with the liberty of any mechanical contrivance being adapted, if every slight difference

    in the application of a well-known thing were held to constitute a patent … No

    sounder or more wholesome doctrine, I think, was ever established than … that you

    cannot have a patent for a well-known mechanical contrivance merely when it is applied in

    a manner or to a purpose, which is not quite the same, but is analogous to the manner or

    the purpose in or to which it has been hitherto notoriously used.</font></p>

an inventive step (or obviousness):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4) ask whether viewed without

    any knowledge of the alleged invention, those differences constitute steps which would

    have been obvious to the skilled man or whether they require any degree of invention.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49

        Applying the first <i>Windsurfing</i> step, the

inventive concepts in the 47151 Patent are (i) top-down magnetic attachment at temporal

positions; (ii) separate projections for the magnet housing at the primary frame; and

(iii) hooking effect. Moving on to the second step, I have found above that the Twincome

frame has anticipated concept (i). It is therefore obvious and does not involve an

inventive step. I have also made a finding of fact that the Twincome has also a separate

projection for the magnet housing and therefore concept (ii) also does not involve an

inventive step. However if I am wrong in that finding, then I would require to take

concept (ii) through the remaining steps of the <i>Windsurfing</i> analysis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50

        I turn to the third step, identification of the

differences between the cited prior art and the alleged invention. In respect of concept

(ii), if the Twincome does not reveal a separate magnet housing projection, then this

would be a material difference as it materially increases the strength of the frame. In

respect of concept (iii), it is again a material difference in that the hooking action is

an additional feature in securing the auxiliary frame to the primary frame.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51 The fourth step of the <i>Windsurfing</i>

analysis is whether it would have been obvious to the skilled person. Dealing first with

concept (ii), the Defendants submit that the use of welding as a method of attachment is

obvious. Of that I have no doubt, but the issue is not the use of welding as a method of

attachment. In my view the substantive idea is the use of a separate piece, welded to the

primary frame, to house the magnet instead of excavating or casting a cavity in the main

frame which would result in a weaker design. In my view, this would have involved an

inventive step if it were not anticipated by the Twincome frame. Concept (iii), the

hooking effect, is an idea that appears obvious with the benefit of hindsight. However

many brilliant ideas have appeared simple with hindsight and the fact that it is not one

of the features in the Twincome, although it takes very little to incorporate it,

indicates that it does involve an inventive step and I so hold.</font></p>

        Pearl’s Optical admit that they had, on 5

April 1999, sold a pair of Gekko spectacle frame (model number CE 9648 46-20-140 J.Jo)

("the Gekko trap purchase"). But they do not admit that such act is an

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53

        Here the Plaintiffs’ case got bogged down.

Although they have called expert witnesses to give evidence on spectacle frames alleged to

be the Gekko trap purchase, they did not call the person who made that trap purchase, or

anyone who may have witnessed it, to identify an exhibit as the Gekko trap purchase.

Therefore the Plaintiffs’ case falls because of this break in the chain of evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54

        Peng Lian have not admitted to anything in

respect of the 47151 Patent. The admissions in their Defence relates to the 60169 Patent.

Hence the Plaintiffs have not proved that Peng Lian had committed any act of infringement

in respect of the 47151 Patent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55

        In view of the fact that there is no evidence

before me of the items sold by the parties that are alleged to infringe the 47151 Patent,

it is not necessary for me to consider expert evidence as to whether the exhibits examined

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57

        Koh Lian Buck ("Koh"), the director

of Pearl’s Optical, deposed to the following. Pearl’s Optical ordered most of

their goods from local distributors like Peng Lian. They sold goods to customers and

buyers on a retail basis. He denied the Plaintiffs’ allegations that Pearl’s

Optical was a wholesaler, importer and exporter of optical products, branded sunglasses

and spectacles.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">58

        Koh said that Pearl’s Optical received a

letter dated 8 April 1999 from M/s TM Hoon &amp; Co ("TMH"), the former

solicitors of Dalmink and Richard Chao, alleging that Pearl’s Optical had sold

spectacle frames that apparently infringed the 47151 Patent. They were told to stop

importing, buying, stocking, distributing and retailing such models, and to destroy such

products. The Plaintiffs also demanded that they provide them with information on

inventory and sales and other business information and that they publish an apology in the

newspapers as well as execute an undertaking.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">59

        Koh immediately consulted his solicitors, M/s

Wee Swee Teow &amp; Co ("WST") on the matter. WST subsequently advised that the

Plaintiffs had indeed registered the 47151 Patent. This surprised Koh as he felt that such

frames were commonplace in the market and had been around for at least a few years.

However he was not certain as to the evidence of that fact and did not wish to incur the

expense of appointing patent agents to do a full search and investigation into this matter

as Pearl’s Optical were only retailers. Furthermore, this type of spectacle frame was

just one of many types of spectacles and sunglasses they sold. So they decided to stop

selling the product. On WST’s advice, Pearl’s Optical immediately stopped

selling any model that could possibly be said to infringe the 47151 Patent. Accordingly

all primary-auxiliary spectacle-sunglasses frames that had magnets in the region of the

temple as their attachment points were withdrawn from their shelves and disposed of.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">60

        Through WST’s letter of 16 April 1999,

Pearl’s Optical informed TMH that they had stopped dealing in those goods. This point

was repeated and emphasised in WST’s letter of 27 April 1999 to TMH in which it was

made clear that whether or not the other matters could be settled, and even while

negotiations by letters were going on, Pearl’s Optical had already stopped infringing

the 47151 Patent and had instituted a voluntary embargo on any goods that could possibly

fall under that Patent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">61

        However after an exchange of without prejudice

correspondence, certain matters could not be resolved. By letter dated 23 September 1999,

TMH wrote to ask if Pearl’s Optical were still keeping to their undertaking not to

sell any potentially infringing items, had removed all such stock from their stores, and

would not sell, restock or display the same from then on pursuant to WST’s letter of

27 April 1999. WST replied on 29 September 1999 to confirm that Pearl’s Optical had

continued and were continuing with their promise not to sell or offer to sell such

products. Koh said that he was surprised that, notwithstanding these undertakings, Dalmink

and Richard Chao instituted Magistrates Court Suit No. 604802 against Pearl’s Optical

for infringement of the 47151 Patent. That MC Suit has since been discontinued in favour

of the present suit commenced on 11 April 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">62

        On 23 March 2000 WST wrote a without prejudice

letter to TMH affirming Pearl’s Optical continuing undertaking not to infringe the

47151 Patent. Despite this, the Plaintiffs included the claim in respect of the 47151

Patent in the present suit. Koh said that in reply to WST’s request for particulars

of acts of infringement, the Plaintiffs’ said that they were relying on the sale of

an allegedly infringing item which took place on 5 April 1999. This was before the

Plaintiffs’ letter of demand of 8 April 1999 which must have been the same act upon

which that letter of demand was based. On the evidence before me I find that Pearl’s

Optical had no knowledge of the 47151 Patent on 5 April 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">63

        As for Peng Lian their proprietor, Yo,

testified that he had heard rumours about a patent for the temple-mounted auxillary frames

but when he asked Dalmink’s sales representatives, they did not know anything about

it. It was not until Pearl’s Optical returned the stocks to Peng Lian sometime in

April 1999 and Koh told him about this that Yo became aware of the 47151 Patent. The

Plaintiffs did not produce any evidence that contradicted this. In the circumstances I

find that Peng Lian did not have knowledge of the 47151 Patent until after 8 April 1999.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">64

        The 60169 Patent relates to the bridge-mounted

frame. The Specifications for this Patent are found in Appendix 2 to this judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">65

        The Plaintiffs submit that the inventive

concepts in the 60169 Patent are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) An eyeglass device where the

    auxiliary frame can be attached to the primary frame by means of magnetic members in a

    top-down manner at the bridge portion with the use of one hand by the user. This concept

    is found in claims 1 and 2.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) An eyeglass device with the

    above features and where only the magnetic members of one of the bridges of the primary

    and auxiliary frames need to be magnets and the other bridge need only be made of

    magnetizable substance. This concept is claimed in claims 3 and 4.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">66

        In respect of concept (i), the Plaintiffs

intend the expression "top-down" to mean the situation where the magnetic

contact is at a horizontal plane. This would be reflected in Figs 4, 6 and 8 in Appendix

2. However this is not the case in Fig 5, where the plane of magnetic contact is at an

angle to the horizontal, and Fig 7 where the magnetic contact is at a vertical plane.

Counsel for the Plaintiffs submit that the words of the Claim prevail over the drawings,

which is correct, and relies on the following words in Claim 1: <i>"an auxiliary

spectacle frame … including a middle bridge portion having a projection extending

over and for engaging with said middle bridge portion of said primary spectacle

frame"</i>. With respect, I cannot see anything in those words that limit the

magnetic contact to the horizontal plane. It only limits the invention to an auxiliary

frame that has a projection that extends over and engages with the middle bridge portion

of the primary frame. I do not see any ambiguity in the words of the claims, but even if

there is, the use of the drawings and description to aid interpretation would surely lead

to the same conclusion because there are specific descriptions and drawings of

"tilted" bridges and magnetic member "extended downward". As for the

second inventive concept, I agree with the Plaintiffs’ characterisation. I therefore

hold that the inventive concepts in the 60169 Patent are:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) An eyeglass device where the

    auxiliary frame can be attached to the primary frame with one hand by means of magnetic

    over and engaging with the bridge of the primary frame. This concept is found in claims 1

    and 2.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) An eyeglass device with the

    above features and where only the magnetic members of one of the bridges of the primary

    and auxiliary frames need to be magnets and the other bridge need only be made of

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74

        The Defendants’ case essentially is this.

The Plaintiffs have chosen to apply for a patent under s 29(1)(c) of the Act, which is one

of the routes towards getting a patent granted in Singapore. This subsection provides as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Where an application for a patent

    complies with all the formal requirements referred to in section 28 (1), the Registrar

    shall notify the applicant who shall —</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) file a request in the

    prescribed form and pay the prescribed fee for a search report within the prescribed

    period;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) file a request in the

    prescribed form and pay the prescribed fee for a search and examination report within the

    prescribed period; or</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) where the applicant has

    filed, alone or jointly with any other person, a corresponding international application

    for a patent, not designating Singapore, or a corresponding application for a patent at

    any prescribed patent office, furnish such detail as prescribed in the prescribed form and

    within the prescribed period, of all the corresponding international applications and the

    other corresponding applications filed by him, and if the applicant fails to make such

    request, pay the prescribed fee or furnish the prescribed detail within the prescribed

    period, the application shall be treated as having been abandoned at the end of the period

    prescribed under paragraph (a), (b) or (c), whichever is the latest.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">75

        Under this route, the patentee relies on the

approval given to a corresponding application in a foreign jurisdiction. The alternative

route is to proceed with a search and examination during the Singapore patent application.

If the s 29(1)(c) route is taken, there is no formal examination by the Registry of

Patents. Under this provision, the applicant must have filed a <i>"corresponding

application"</i> for a patent at any prescribed patent office. That term is defined

in s 29(12) as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In this Part, "corresponding

    international application" and "corresponding application", in relation to

    an invention, mean an application for protection filed, respectively, under the Patent

    Co-operation Treaty or with any prescribed patent office in respect of the same or

    substantially the same invention as that which is the subject of the application in suit,

    the application filed under the Patent Co-operation Treaty or with the prescribed patent

    office being —</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the basis for a priority

      claim under section 17 in the application in suit; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) subject to a priority claim

      based on the application in suit or an application which is also the basis for a priority

      claim under section 17 in the application in suit.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another advantage of this route

is that the applicant can rely on the priority date of an earlier foreign application. But

that application must be <i>"the same or substantially the same invention"</i>

as the one filed in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">76

        The Plaintiffs have, on 13 December 1996, filed

in the USA the patent application in respect of the US 054 Patent which was granted on 7

April 1998. The US Patent Office is a prescribed patent office: see r 41 of the Patents

Rules. In their Singapore application, the Plaintiffs submitted the US 054 Patent as the

corresponding application and the 60169 Patent was granted on the basis of that patent

with the same priority date even though the Singapore application was filed almost a year

later, on 11 December 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">77

        The problem lies with the fact that the scope

of the US 054 Patent is not the same as that of the 60169 Patent. The latter essentially

follows the US 054 Patent but with (i) the addition of a drawing, Fig 9, which shows two

magnets on each bridge, and the corresponding description; and (ii) the deletion of the

following statement in the US 054 Patent:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However, two pairs of magnet

    members are required such that the manufacturing cost is increased. In addition, the user

    have to align two pairs of magnet members.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An essential feature of the US

054 Patent therefore is that each bridge has only one magnet. However in the 60169 Patent,

Fig 9 and the corresponding description feature two magnets on each bridge. The Plaintiffs

submit that this is not a material difference and that the scope of the US 054 Patent is

wide enough to cover two magnets on each bridge. However in my view the language of the

claim in the US 054 Patent, as interpreted by the description and drawings clearly

restrict it to a single magnet. The Defendants submit that this is reinforced by the fact

that the Plaintiffs have applied for and obtained another US Patent for the double magnet

configuration, which is US Patent No 6,012,811.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">78

        As the claim in the 60169 Patent is wider than

that in the US 054 Patent, the latter is, in my view, not substantially the same invention

as the former. The Defendants submit that the 60169 Patent ought to be revoked pursuant to

s 80(1)(f) of the Act which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Subject to the provisions of this

    Act, the Registrar may, on the application of any person, by order revoke a patent for an

    invention on (but only on) any of the following grounds:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(f) the applicant for the patent

    has failed to inform the Registrar about any corresponding international application or

    corresponding application filed by him as required under section 29(1)(c) or has furnished

    any information which in any material particular was false; …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In submitting the US 054 Patent

as a corresponding application when it does not pertain to substantially the same

invention, the Plaintiffs have furnished information which is false in a material

particular. What the Plaintiffs have in effect gained by this is a dispensation of

examination in respect of the widened scope of the claim, and an earlier priority date for

that widened scope than they would otherwise have been entitled to. In my view this is

sufficient for the Registrar to exercise the powers under s 80.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">79

        Pursuant to s 91(1) of the Act, this Court has

the powers granted to the Registrar under s 80(1). However s 80(5) provides for mitigation

of the rather blunt sword of revocation. That subsection states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(5) An order under this section

    may be —</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) an order for the

    unconditional revocation of the patent; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) where one of the grounds

    mentioned in subsection (1) has been established, but only so as to invalidate the patent

    to a limited extent, an order that the patent should be revoked unless within a specified

    time the specification is amended under section 83 to the satisfaction of the Registrar.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In my opinion, it would be

appropriate to exercise this power and give the Plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their

application to conform with the narrower scope of the US 054 Patent.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">82

        The invention to which the 60169 Patent

applies, so far as it relates to the use of two magnets on each bridge, is not supported

by matter disclosed in the US 054 Patent. Accordingly s 17(2)(a) is not satisfied and the

priority date of the 60169 Patent is not the date of filing of the US 054 Patent, at least

in respect of the double-magnet feature. </font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">83

        As in the case of the 47151 Patent,

Pearl’s Optical similarly admit that they had, on 23 December 1999, sold a pair of

Giacoma Puccini Frame (Model GP08146‚ 19, Color 14) ("the Giacoma trap

purchase"). And they similarly do not admit that it infringes the 60169 Patent (if

valid) and put the Plaintiffs to strict proof. Again the Plaintiffs’ case got into

trouble on the evidence. They did not call any witness to identify the exhibit alleged to

be the Giacoma trap purchase. Accordingly the Plaintiffs’ case in this respect also

falls.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">84

        However in respect of Peng Lian, they have

admitted in the pleadings that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) they have infringed claim 1

    or claim 2 of the 60169 Patent (if valid); and</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) they are the distributors of

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Admission (i) above means that

Peng Lian have committed the acts of infringement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">85

        I turn now to the AZ Optics. Again the

Plaintiffs’ case falls short due to lack of evidence. The person who is alleged to

have made the trap purchase was not called to give evidence and identify the item

purchased. The Plaintiffs’ witness for this purpose appears to be Teo Kim Men, the

Managing Director of Dalmink. But he confirmed that he was not personally involved in the

trap purchase from AZ Optics. As such he was not able to identify from his own knowledge

the item concerned. I hold therefore that it is not proven that AZ Optics had committed

any act of infringement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">86

        The evidence against Lee Meng is similarly

inadequate. Lee Meng rely on the fact that the infringing item in question was not

identified. The trap purchase is alleged to be made by the same person as in AZ Optics. It

is puzzling why he was not called, but he was not. Accordingly the Plaintiffs have failed

to prove that Lee Meng have sold any item that infringes the 60169 Patent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">87

        Pearl’s Optical, Peng Lian and Lee Meng

have counterclaimed against the Plaintiff for groundless threats. The threats made by the

Plaintiffs in the form of warning notices and demand letters are not denied.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">90

        On behalf of Peng Lian, Yo gave evidence that

after receiving notice of the Plaintiffs’ threats Peng Lian stopped selling or

distributing products that the Plaintiffs claimed infringed the 47151 Patent. He claimed

he incurred losses as a result of the threat. He added that he had to collect back some

1000 to 2000 pairs of temple-mounted frames from his customers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">91

        In view of my findings that the Pearl’s

Optical and Peng Lian have not committed the acts of infringement, it follows that the

Plaintiffs have made groundless threats against them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">92

        In relation to the 60169 Patent, the Plaintiffs

have similarly failed to prove that Pearl’s Optical and AZ Optics have committed acts

of infringement. In respect of Peng Lian, no priority date can be claimed on the invention

in respect of the double-magnet feature. There is no evidence that the acts of

infringement admitted by Peng Lian relates to a spectacle frames with a single magnet on

the bridges. Indeed none of the exhibits produced, whether admissible or otherwise, relate

to a single-magnet feature. Therefore the Plaintiffs have made groundless threats against

all four Defendants in respect of the 60169 Patent.</font></p>

Section 75 of the Act provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Where by virtue of a transaction,

    instrument or event to which Section 43 applies, a person becomes the proprietor or one of

    the proprietors or an exclusive licensee of a patent and the patent is subsequently

    infringed, the court or the Registrar shall not award him damages or order that he be

    given an account of the profits in respect of such a subsequent infringement occurring

    before the transaction, instrument or event is registered unless:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the transaction, instrument

    or event is registered within the period of 6 months beginning with its date; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) the court or the Registrar is

    satisfied that it was not practicable to register the transaction, instrument or event

    before the end of that period and that it was registered as soon as practicable.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">94

        Richard Chao is registered as the proprietor of

the 47151 Patent. He assigned it to Contour Optik on 6 January 1997. This assignment was

recorded on 26 August 2000. The exclusive licence agreement with Dalmink was executed on 1

February 1997. The recordal of that licence was done on 1 September 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">95

        The Defendants submit that by operation of s 75

Contour Optik cannot claim damages for any infringement in respect of the 47151 Patent

prior to 26 August 2000 as the recordals were done more than six months after the date of

the agreements. Similary Dalmink cannot do so in respect of infringements before 1

September 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">96

        In the case of the 60169 Patent, Contour Optik

is registered as the proprietor. They executed a License and Distribution Agreement dated

1 January 1998 which granted an exclusive licence to Dalmink. This agreement was

registered with the Registry of Patents on 25 August 2000. The Defendants submit that

Dalmink may not claim damages for infringement of the 60169 Patent prior to 25 August

2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">97

        The Plaintiffs submit that although the

instruments were not registered within the six-month window, the registrations were done

within a reasonably practicable time, thereby falling within s 75(b). However this is a

bare submission and the Plaintiffs did not adduce any evidence of their registering the

instruments as soon as it was practicable to do so. The delays are not in terms of weeks

or months, but years: in the 47151 Patent, the instruments were registered more than three

and a half years after execution and in the 60169 Patent, more than two and a half years.

In those circumstances I would have thought that it would take considerable evidence to

prove that contention.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">98

        The Plaintiffs also point out that Peng Lian

did not suffer any prejudice by the late recordal and ask the Court to take a benevolent

view of the delay. However even if that is correct as a fact, it is not a relevant factor

under the Act. For s 75(b) to be invoked two matters must be shown to the satisfaction of

the court or Registrar: (i) that it was not practical for the registration to be effected

within the six-month period; and (ii) that it was done as soon as practicable. In the

circumstances of this case there is no evidence of either matter and hence there is no

question that the Plaintiffs cannot rely on s 75(b).</font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">

    to damages in respect of groundless threats made by the Plaintiffs against each of the

    four Defendants and an order for the Plaintiffs to pay the assessed damages and statutory

    interest thereon from the date of this judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) The Plaintiffs shall pay the

    costs of the four Defendants to be agreed or taxed.</font></p>

    pursuant to s 80(5) of the Act that the 60169 Patent shall be revoked unless the

    specification is amended under s 83 to the satisfaction of the Registrar within six months
