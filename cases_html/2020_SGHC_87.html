</div>  The second defendant, M.R.K. Enterprises Pte Ltd, is the creditor which had successfully applied in CWU 252/2018 for the winding-up order.  The second defendant opposed the application by the plaintiff for the winding-up order to be stayed or set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff, which holds more than 90% of the shareholding in the first defendant, did not allege that there was any defect in the winding-up order made by Woo J.  The plaintiff accepted that the order was regularly obtained, and there was no allegation that the formal statutory requirements for winding-up had not been met.  In particular, there was no suggestion that the statutory demand against the first defendant or the winding-up papers had not been properly served, or that the required advertisements had not been taken out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Instead, the plaintiff’s case was that the debt claimed by the second defendant, which formed the basis of its statutory demand, was not a debt actually owed by the first defendant.

Dr Reddy’s evidence was that Mr Mahesh had sought the US$2m loan to finance the acquisition of a plant from the Shell Oil Company as part of a project in the petrochemicals sector.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  As a preliminary point, I was of the view that the plaintiff had improperly conflated the inherent jurisdiction of the Court and the inherent <span class="font-italic">power</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> of the Court.  The inherent powers of the Court are specifically provided for in O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), where reference is made to “the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court”.  As was noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</span> [2013] 3 SLR 258 at [40] and [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he inherent jurisdiction of the court actually refers to an exercise of the inherent powers of the court … it would be preferable to refer to the exercise of [the Court’s] right to regulate matters properly before [it] as the exercise of the court’s inherent powers rather than its inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I next turned to the issue of whether winding-up orders <span class="font-italic">can</span> in fact be set aside pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers.  In this regard, there appeared to be differing views in the authorities.  In <span class="font-italic">Interocean Holdings Group (BVI) Ltd v Zi-</span><span class="font-italic">Techasia (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2014] 2 SLR 485 at [16], Edmund Leow JC observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In Singapore, a winding-up order once perfected is one of those strange creatures that cannot be set aside or revoked.  At least, there is no express provision in the [CA] permitting this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 However, in <span class="font-italic">Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd v Construction Professional Resources Pte Ltd</span> [2019] 5 SLR 709 (“<span class="font-italic">Standard Chartered</span>”) at [10], Choo Han Teck J expressed the view, in the context of an application to set aside a winding-up order, that the inherent powers of the court under O 92 r 4 of the ROC “can be used in instances where [they] can express justice and ensure no prejudice to anyone in any way”.  In that case, the inherent powers of the Court were relied on to set aside a winding-up order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Eventually though, this point was not argued before me.  In fact, the plaintiff did not even refer to the fact that it was seeking the setting aside of the winding-up order in its submissions.  The question of whether the fraud on the Court (see [4] above) as alleged by the plaintiff would suffice to warrant the setting aside of the winding-up order pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers was simply not addressed.  I was thus led to the inexorable conclusion that the plaintiff had, for all intents and purposes, abandoned the prayer for relief in the form of setting aside of the winding-up order.  In any event, the issue of setting aside the winding-up order was rendered moot by my findings as outlined below.  I therefore say no more on this particular issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Indefinite stay of the winding-up order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I turned then to the relief of a stay sought by the plaintiff, which was dealt with in its submissions.  As the plaintiff itself recognised, an indefinite stay against the winding-up order would be premised on the application of s 279 of the CA.  In particular, s 279(1) of the CA provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) At any time after an order for winding up has been made, the Court may, on the application of the liquidator or of any creditor or contributory and on proof to the satisfaction of the Court that all proceedings in relation to the winding up ought to be stayed, make an order staying the proceedings either altogether or for a limited time on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">Phang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choo Ong v Gilcom Investment Pte Ltd (LRG Investments Pte Ltd and another, non-parties) </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Phang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choo Ong</span>”), LRG Investments Pte Ltd had applied to wind up Gilcom Investment Pte Ltd (“Gilcom”) on the basis of a default judgment obtained against it.  A winding-up order was duly granted.  The plaintiff there, who was the sole director and shareholder of Gilcom, sought a stay of that winding-up order pursuant to s 279(1) of the CA so that Gilcom could be allowed to apply to court to set aside the default judgment.  The stay was not granted.  In particular, Chua Lee Ming JC (“Chua JC”), as he then was, was not satisfied that Gilcom was in fact able to pay its debts.  At [18] to [20], Chua JC succinctly summarised three broad but non-exhaustive principles which guide the exercise of the Court’s discretion under s 279(1) of the CA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, an applicant for a stay has to show that the state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exists.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, a stay will be refused if granting a stay would be detrimental to “commercial morality” and the interests of the public at large.  While the term “commercial morality” defies ready definition, Chua JC made reference to the court having to be satisfied that it would be reasonable to entrust the affairs of the company to the directors under whose management the company had previously been subjected to an order for winding-up, and to the court having to be satisfied that the trading operations of the company have been “fair and above board”, particularly when there has been a failure by the directors in their obligations to furnish information to the official receiver.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, a stay will be refused if the interests of the creditors, the members and the liquidator are not protected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The parties before me did not dispute that the Court’s exercise of its discretion under s 279 of the CA is guided by reference to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the abovementioned principles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I pause to make the observation that cases involving s 279 of the CA typically involve situations where the company which was the subject of the winding-up order manages to pay the debts owed, or where the debts were later forgiven or waived by the lenders.  For example, in <span class="font-italic">Standard Chartered</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the defendant applied to have the winding-up order stayed on the grounds that the debt had since been paid and the plaintiff had no objection to the stay on that premise.  The issue of fraud (see [4] above), by contrast, is not commonly used as a basis to seek an indefinite stay of winding-up orders under s 279 of the CA.  However, I accepted that s 279 of the CA is worded broadly enough to include fraud as a basis for an indefinite stay, and was satisfied that a fraud practised on the Court could, at least in principle, warrant an indefinite stay of a winding-up order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In addition, I note that if one were to succeed in proving fraud for the purpose of an application for an indefinite stay of a winding-up order under s 279 of the CA, such fraud would not only warrant the imposition of a stay as sought, it may well be sufficient grounds for <span class="font-italic">setting aside</span> the impugned winding-up order.  An order of court procured by fraud, sensibly, is a nullity <span class="font-italic">in toto</span>.  Setting aside, in that light, may thus be the more appropriate remedy to be pursued in cases involving fraud.  Setting aside extinguishes the order of court in its entirety, whereas an indefinite stay by its very nature contemplates the possibility of that stay being lifted (and the underlying winding-up order resurrected).  I struggle to see what could justify the lifting of a stay in cases where fraud has been sufficiently proven.  With that said, as mentioned earlier (see [17] above), the plaintiff did not in fact pursue the relief of setting aside the winding-up order, despite having indicated that it would do so in the amended OS.  Even though the substance of the plaintiff’s complaint about the winding-up order was that it was procured by fraud, the plaintiff argued <span class="font-italic">only</span> for an indefinite stay, and did not argue in its submissions that the order should be set aside.  The second defendant also proceeded on the basis that a stay could be granted if fraud was shown.  Consequently, the specific discussion on fraud and whether it could or should be used as a basis to seek an indefinite stay of a winding-up order under s 279 of the CA (even when the remedy of setting aside the order could instead be sought) was not addressed before me in this OS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On a separate note, it also bears reiteration that the present case was an application <span class="font-italic">by the plaintiff</span> to stay a regularly-obtained order of court for the winding-up of the first defendant.  Thus, there was no doubt to my mind that the burden was <span class="font-italic">squarely</span> on the plaintiff to persuade me that a stay or setting aside of the order should be granted. As was observed in <span class="font-italic">Phang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choo Ong</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… An applicant for a stay has to show that the state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exists.  Where the winding up was on the ground of insolvency, the applicant has to show that the company is solvent … Credible evidence of solvency is required, not least because the court is putting the company back into operation.  Mere assertions of solvency will not be sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span><span class="font-italic"> International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jalalludin bin Abdullah and other matters</span> [2013] 2 SLR 801, after making the bankruptcy orders against the defendant-guarantors, Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC, as he then was, dismissed their application for a stay of execution of the insolvency orders.  In so doing, the Judicial Commissioner considered at [96] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In insolvency proceedings as in ordinary civil proceedings … the onus is therefore squarely on the defendant to show why it is appropriate to stay the proceedings or to stay execution of the orders rather than to let the insolvency proceedings run their normal course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Therefore, it being the plaintiff that was seeking to prevent the winding-up order from taking effect, the plaintiff had to discharge the burden of showing that the “state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exist[ed]”.  In the context of this case, the onus accordingly fell on the plaintiff to prove that the first defendant was in fact solvent, and that the second defendant’s case that there was a loan owing from the first defendant should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be accepted by the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Not only was the burden of proof in the present proceedings on the plaintiff – I further noted that this burden is not readily discharged.  Instead, the plaintiff “must make out a case that carries conviction”: <span class="font-italic">In re Calgary and Edmonton Land Co Ltd</span> [1975] 1 WLR 355 at 359, as approved by Chua JC at [15] of <span class="font-italic">Phang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choo Ong</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The nature of the US$2m transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The thrust of the plaintiff’s case was that the winding-up order should not have been made because the US$2m transaction was not a loan which was owing from the first defendant to the second defendant, but was in fact consideration for a separate transaction (see [10] above).  The only two persons who gave evidence before me who had <span class="font-italic">personal</span> and <span class="font-italic">direct</span> knowledge of the alleged US$2m loan were Mr Mahesh and Dr Reddy.  Mr Mahesh’s evidence was completely at odds with Dr Reddy’s.  One of them was obviously not telling the truth as to the existence or otherwise of this purported orally-agreed loan.  An assessment of their credibility was thus essential for my decision.  In this regard, I could not accept the plaintiff’s rather surprising submission that there was no need <span class="font-italic">at all</span> for me to consider the issue of Mr Mahesh’s credibility.

While neither party’s evidence was entirely cogent, certain aspects of Mr Mahesh’s evidence were startling in their defiance of logic, and were <span class="font-italic">entirely</span> devoid of documentary support.  The following instances are some examples of the deficiencies in the evidence of Mr Mahesh.  The cumulative weight of these deficiencies rendered it impossible for me to accept Mr Mahesh’s (and by extension, the plaintiff’s) contention that the state of affairs that required the first defendant to be wound up no longer existed (see [19(a)] above), or more precisely, never existed.  I was also not able to accept that the US$2m transferred from the second defendant to the first defendant was consideration for shares purchased by the second defendant in Raycom.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The purchase price for the Raycom shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Given that the plaintiff’s central claim was that the US$2m transferred by the second defendant to the first defendant was consideration for Dr Reddy’s purchase of shares in Raycom, one might have expected that the plaintiff would have been able to at least identify the purchase price of the shares in Raycom which had purportedly been purchased.  After all, Mr Mahesh (who was the ultimate beneficial owner of the plaintiff) also owned and controlled the first defendant and Raycom.

</div>  This share purchase agreement signed by Fraser Corp Pte Ltd was never produced to verify Mr Mahesh’s claims.

The fact that Mr Mahesh actually signed the “handwritten note” and allowed Dr Reddy to retain it suggested that it was intended to assure the latter that the loan would be repaid as promised.

</div>  The language in this last text message I have referred to echoes what Mr Mahesh had written in the “handwritten note” when he referred to a “personal loan” of US$2m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In light of the documentary evidence, I did not think that the plaintiff could seriously argue that the sum of US$2m transferred on 12 June 2013 was actually not a loan, but instead part-payment of the second defendant’s acquisition of shares in Raycom.  I also found it highly significant that Mr Mahesh had been given an opportunity to file a final affidavit in reply to Dr Reddy’s affidavit dated 11 July 2019, where the above emails and text messages had been exhibited and referred to, but failed to give any explanation at all for these emails and text messages in his reply affidavit dated 31 July 2019.  Strikingly, Mr Mahesh was wholly unable to produce any documents, emails, or text messages to support his bare allegation that he had refuted Dr Reddy’s claim that the loan of US$2m had been taken by him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Overall, the above episodes illustrate the limited credibility of Mr Mahesh’s evidence.  He shifted his position on numerous issues, and his claims were contradicted by his own correspondence.  He showed himself to be willing to claim that there existed documentation to support his claims, only to completely fail to actually produce that purported documentation when called upon to do so.  I was therefore unable to accept the plaintiff’s claim that the US$2m transferred from the second defendant to the first defendant was not a loan and was instead part-payment for shares in Raycom.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second defendant’s “ledger”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Against the weight of all the aforementioned evidence, the plaintiff pointed me to an inconsistency in the evidence of the second defendant’s director, Mr Pisupati Seshachalam Murali (“Mr Pisupati”).

</div> The plaintiff’s argument in this regard was twofold.  First, there was an inconsistency between the amount Mr Pisupati alleged to be the applicable interest rate on the loan of 3% in his oral evidence, and the interest rate of 10% which was referenced in the “handwritten note”.  Second, Mr Pisupati himself appeared to have accepted that, whatever the interest rate applicable, the fact that the loan from Dr Reddy to the second defendant was interest-bearing made it commercially unviable for the second defendant to only be seeking the return of the principal amount (<span class="font-italic">sans</span> interest) of US$2m from the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The plaintiff urged me to infer from these discrepancies that the transfer of approximately US$2m on 12 June 2013 must therefore be part of the consideration of US$6.1m for the Raycom shares.  I could not see why such an inference would necessarily flow from the matters outlined at [54] and [55] above.  After all, the second defendant had produced its bank statements and other financial documents from 2012 and 2013 which showed various transfers to the first defendant from the second defendant and other related entities adding up to more than US$6.1m.  The second defendant asserted that these transfers included, and fully accounted for, the payments for the Raycom shares. Thus, quite apart from the US$2m transfer on 12 June 2013, there was ample basis for me to accept that a total purchase price of US$6.1m had been in fact transferred by the second defendant for the purchase of the Raycom shares.

</div>  However, despite claiming that he could get documents, such as bank statements of the first defendant which were with its auditors, that would substantiate what he said, no such documents were eventually produced in these proceedings by the plaintiff or the first defendant to support Mr Mahesh’s bare allegation that the money transfers adding up to US$6.1m were for other matters unrelated to the acquisition of the Raycom shares.  This was yet another instance of Mr Mahesh making rather convenient claims about documents which purportedly supported his position, but never actually producing them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Given the evidence, I was of the view that the more natural inference is that the “ledger” was inaccurate in setting out the dates of the transfers, a possibility that was also suggested by Mr Pisupati.  Upon examination of the “ledger”, it appeared that the document was not part of the accounts or financial records of the second defendant, but a document that was prepared for some other purpose.

</div>  In other words, it did not appear to be a true “ledger” in the accounting sense.  That being so, the more likely explanation was that this document had been inaccurately prepared.  On balance, I accepted Mr Pisupati’s evidence in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Further, I should add that I did not consider the plaintiff’s arguments as outlined at [55] above to be persuasive.  While there might have been uncertainty over the precise interest rate of the loan from the second defendant to the first defendant, there was clear evidence – whether from the “handwritten note” or Mr Mahesh’s correspondence with Dr Reddy – that the US$2m transferred from the second defendant to the first defendant was a loan and not payment for shares in Raycom.  There also existed a whole range of possibilities which might have explained the apparent inconsistencies.  For example, Dr Reddy might have been willing to forgo the interest if at least the principal loan amount was recovered, Mr Pisupati may not have been privy to the final discussion between Mr Mahesh and Dr Reddy about the precise interest rate applicable, or Mr Pisupati may simply have been mistaken.  Either way, none of these possibilities precluded a contract of loan existing between the first and second defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second defendant’s financial statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The plaintiff also referred me to the audited accounts of the second defendant and argued that those accounts did not reflect that there was a loan outstanding from the first defendant.

</div>  In particular, the plaintiff relied on the audited accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2013.  It pointed out that, while notes to the accounts showed that there were outstanding loan receivables of about US$10.5m, these loans were described as being “secured” by the “borrowing companies’ assets” and as carrying an interest rate of 3% per annum.

According to the plaintiff, this suggested that the alleged loan was interest-free, and that it was not secured by any of the first defendant’s assets.  The reference in the second defendant’s audited accounts to its outstanding loan receivables as being secured by the borrowing companies’ assets and carrying an interest rate of 3% per annum would thus <span class="font-italic">not</span> appear to include the unsecured loan of US$2m claimed by the second defendant in the statutory demand to be owing from the first defendant.

</div>  This in turn, according to the plaintiff, suggested that the US$2m transfer was not a loan and was instead something else.  In this light, the plaintiff submitted that Mr Pisupati’s allegation in his oral evidence that the US$2m loan to the first defendant had an interest rate of 3%, which had not been raised in his affidavit evidence, was an attempt to force the US$2m loan to fit within the description of the loan receivables in the financial statements.

They did not, in and of themselves, trump the probative weight of other evidence tending to prove or disprove the existence of the US$2m loan.  This is made clear by the illustration to s 34 of the EA, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A sues B for $1,000 and shows entries in his account-books showing B to be indebted to him to this amount.

While it might reflexively be argued that the standard of proof is different in a criminal case given that it concerned potential infringements on liberty, the Court of Appeal observed at [55] of <span class="font-italic">SIC College of Business and </span><span class="font-italic">Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh Siah and others</span> [2016] 2 SLR 118 (“<span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While it was ultimately within the scope of the Judge’s discretion to admit the evidence, the admission of the Printout was not in itself sufficient, without other evidence, to prove a <span class="font-italic">debt</span> because s 34 of the Evidence Act states that such statements “shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability”. The obvious danger of relying on account book entries is even greater if the claimant or one of his affiliates was the one who was making the records. This danger remains even if accountants had given an unqualified opinion on the previous consolidated accounts that formed the basis for the first transaction on the ledger.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The relevance of <span class="font-italic">direct</span> evidence as opposed to only relying on the accounts was also emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Re Ice-Mack Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 283 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Ice-Mack</span>”), which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>.  At [21] of <span class="font-italic">Re Ice-Mack</span>, Yong Pung How CJ observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It may well be that, in what might be called a straightforward case, documents such as those produced by the applicant [under s 34 of the Evidence Act] might be accepted as sufficient evidence to prove a debt obligation. But, in this case, once the validity of the claim was challenged, it was incumbent on the applicant to go to the root of the matter and to produce proper evidence of the various “loans and payments for and on behalf of the company” ... which it claimed to have made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These cases underscore the importance of not placing undue weight on accounts, especially when direct evidence is available.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On the instant facts, the direct evidence in the form of the testimony of Mr Mahesh and Dr Reddy, and their correspondence with each other, offered better probative value on the question of the existence of the USD$2m loan than the company’s accounts.  These accounts, like the “ledger”, were presumably prepared by accounts staff who may not have had the full picture.  The accounts might therefore have contained errors which passed unnoticed by the directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, the sum claimed in the statutory demand should not be taken as being determinative of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the claims owing from the debtor to the creditor.  This is clear from [9] of <span class="font-italic">Re Inter-Builders Development Pte Ltd </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 126, where this Court held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) [of the CA] would operate if the petitioning creditor can establish that a sum exceeding [the statutory threshold] is due to him from the company and he has made a demand for a sum in excess of [the statutory threshold] in the manner provided in s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) which the debtor has neglected to pay.  To hold otherwise would, in the words of Lord Chelmsford quoted above [in <span class="font-italic">Cardiff Preserved Coal and Coke Co v Norton</span> (1867) LR 2 Ch App 405 at 410] “make every winding-up order bad where the creditor had demanded the smallest sum above what was actually due to him”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">What is clear from this extract is that the creditor does not need to stipulate the <span class="font-italic">precise</span> amount owing in the statutory demand.  All that is required is that the amount claimed exceeds the statutory threshold, and that the amount claimed is in fact owed to the creditor.  This approach is unsurprising – a creditor may wish to claim only an amount which is <span class="font-italic">indisputably</span> owed to him in a statutory demand rather than risk a dispute over issues like interest, especially if his objective is to get quick payment or seek the winding up of the company.  While r 94(2) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Rules”) does require that the statutory demand state the actual amount of debt that has accrued as of the date of the demand, as observed by Valerie Thean J in <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Ashok Bherumal v Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1304 at [21] and [22], non-compliance with r 94 of the Bankruptcy Rules is not, without more, fatal.  Rather, the Court has the power to make appropriate orders in relation to the statutory demand to ensure that substantial justice is done as between the parties.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal specifically agreed with Thean J that the court had the power to remedy irregularities in relation to statutory demands so long as substantive injustice would not be occasioned by the remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In short, the contents of the statutory demand issued by the second defendant were not determinative as to the precise amount that is owed from the first defendant to the second defendant, and whether the loan was an interest-free one.  I did not have to make any findings as to what the actual amount owed by the first defendant to the second defendant was, or on the agreed interest rate, given that such findings would have been unnecessary for me to decide whether to have granted the plaintiff’s application to stay the winding-up order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my judgment, the plaintiff has placed undue weight on the second defendant’s accounts and on the precise amount claimed in the statutory demand to assert a potential inconsistency, even in the face of the clear direct evidence available.  As already explained, I found the direct evidence to be overwhelmingly in support of a finding that there was a US$2m loan, and that the loan was due and owing from the first defendant to the second defendant.  This in turn suggested to me that the more plausible explanation for the inconsistencies outlined above was that the audited accounts of the second defendant were simply inaccurate.  I found that the probative value to be accorded to the accounts was minimal at best, and that what little probative value could be ascribed was plainly insufficient to overcome the clear and direct evidence from the key protagonists.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The solvency of the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Another significant aspect of the plaintiff’s case which I found troubling was the fact that neither Mr Mahesh nor Mr Perumal dealt in their affidavits with the issue of the three promissory notes given to Dr Reddy and his related entities.

It was not disputed that both the GV Reddy Irrevocable Trust U/D/T and DFT Group LLC are entities associated with Dr Reddy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At the hearing of SUM 5620/2018 on 12 December 2018, which was the plaintiff’s application for an interim stay of the winding-up order pending the resolution of the OS, the issue of the first defendant’s solvency was raised.  Counsel for the second defendant drew my attention to the fact that the three abovementioned promissory notes totalling an amount of US$1.5m had been given by Mr Mahesh on behalf of the first defendant to Dr Reddy and his related entities.  Three statutory demands had also been served on the first defendant in respect of these promissory notes in September 2018.

</div>  As a result of the <span class="font-italic">flagrant failure</span> by the first defendant and its directors to comply with my order of 12 December 2018, the Liquidator was not able to produce his report, and I was left with no reliable information as to the solvency of the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 There was no explanation in the affidavits of Mr Perumal or Mr Mahesh as to why my order was not complied with.  In his oral evidence, Mr Perumal stated that he left it to Mr Krishnan and Mr Mahesh to provide the necessary information and documents to the Liquidator.  Mr Krishnan then resigned as a director.  Mr Mahesh’s explanation, given only when he was cross-examined, was that he did not have many of the documents requested by the Liquidator because these documents were in the custody of the liquidators of the subsidiaries of the first defendant.  He claimed that he had written to those liquidators to ask for documents belonging to the first defendant, even though there was no documentary evidence <span class="font-italic">whatsoever </span>placed before me indicating that he had actually done so.  This was despite express requests for such documentary evidence by the second defendant’s counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I did not accept Mr Mahesh’s and Mr Perumal’s belated explanations for not complying with the order that I made on 12 December 2018.  In fact, I found Mr Mahesh’s claim that he did not have <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the documents requested by the Liquidator to be rather unbelievable.  This was because he had been able to procure the accountants of the first defendant to produce a set of updated unaudited management accounts of the company for the past four years, which the plaintiff had applied to introduce into evidence in the course of the hearing in June 2019 via SUM 3062/2018.  I dismissed this application for various reasons, including the fact that the accountants were themselves not being called as witnesses to explain these accounts.  More importantly, this was a <span class="font-italic">blatant </span>attempt to circumvent my order of 12 December 2018, pursuant to which I had wanted the Liquidator of the first defendant, an officer of the Court, to carry out this exercise of examining the financial condition of the company, and not Mr Mahesh’s chosen accountants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Given the state of the evidence before me, I found that the plaintiff had not discharged its burden of showing that the first defendant was solvent and able to carry on as a going concern.  This went towards the first of the considerations outlined in <span class="font-italic">Phang</span><span class="font-italic"> Choo Ong</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).

I accepted that the first defendant did in fact owe the second defendant the sum of US$2m because of a loan extended by the second defendant to the first defendant.  I was unable to accept that the US$2m transaction was part-payment for shares in Raycom.  Even if I was mistaken on this, I noted that the promissory notes and the parlous state of the evidence led by the plaintiff on the financial position of the first defendant left me unconvinced that the company was in fact solvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Accordingly, there was no basis to stay the winding-up order.  There was also no basis whatsoever to set aside the order.
