The Judge granted leave to appeal to this court as the application for leave to appeal “was not seriously resisted [by the respondent] as such” (see the GD at [46]). The Judge was also “satisfied that leave should be granted on the basis that there were questions of importance for which a Court of Appeal pronouncement or guidance would be useful” (see <span class="font-italic">ibid</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 As will be seen in the grounds that follow, the Judge had correctly identified all the reasons which supported his decision. We agree wholly with them and, consequently, the decision he arrived at; the present judgment can therefore be brief. The detailed facts and background to this appeal may be found in the GD itself at [2]–[8].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background and issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The principal issue turned upon the interpretation of O 48 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“O 48 r 1(1)”), which pertains to examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) proceedings. O 48 r 1(1) itself reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Order for examination of judgment debtor (O. 48, r.1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1.—</span>(1) Where a person has obtained a judgment or order for the payment by some other person (referred to in this Order as the judgment debtor) of money, the Court may, on an application made by ex parte summons supported by affidavit in Form 99 by the person entitled to enforce the judgment or order, order the judgment debtor, or, if the judgment debtor is a body corporate, an officer thereof, to attend before the Registrar, and be orally examined on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whatever property the judgment debtor has and wheresoever situated</span>, and the Court may also order the judgment debtor or officer to produce any books or documents in the possession of the judgment debtor relevant to the questions aforesaid at the time and place appointed for the examination. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The respondent had applied for as well as obtained leave to enforce awards obtained in arbitration proceedings (“the Awards”) in Singapore. A judgment was granted (“the Singapore Judgment”), which then formed the basis of the EJD proceedings that are the subject of the present appeal. In particular, pursuant to the EJD proceedings, a number of questions in the form of a questionnaire had been directed to an officer of the appellant, in preparation for the oral examination of the said officer. The appellant objected to some of the questions which fell within two categories. The first category concerned assets of corporate entities related to the appellant or the said officer. There is no appeal against either the AR’s decision or the Judge’s decision <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> this particular category of questions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The second category of questions related to assets of the appellant <span class="font-italic">located in the Maldives</span>. These questions were permitted by both the AR and the Judge, notwithstanding the fact that the Awards could <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been enforced <span class="font-italic">in the Maldives at the time</span> (there is an appeal pending against the decision of the Maldivian court which had decided the same). The present appeal is with regard to the decision of the Judge <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> this particular category of questions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Put simply, the main thrust of the appellant’s argument in this appeal is that the language of O 48 r 1(1) and of Form 99 of the Rules of Court (“Form 99”), considered together with this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span><span class="font-italic"> Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund I Ltd Partnership </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1116 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span>”), meant that the Rules of Court permit questions as part of the EJD proceedings <span class="font-italic">only if</span> the <span class="font-italic">judgment concerned </span>(here, the Singapore Judgment) could be <span class="font-italic">enforced in</span> the <span class="font-italic">foreign jurisdiction</span> itself (here, the Maldives). The appellant also cited the AR’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Indian Overseas Bank v Sarabjit Singh </span>[1990] 3 MLJ xxxi (“<span class="font-italic">IOB</span>”) in support of its argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 With respect, there is, in fact, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a fundamental flaw</span> in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the underlying premise</span> of the appellant’s argument – it presupposes that questions pursuant to the EJD proceedings can be asked with regard to assets <span class="font-italic">within</span> a particular jurisdiction (here, the Maldives) <span class="font-italic">only if</span> the judgment creditor (here, the respondent) can satisfy the court that the judgment concerned (here, the Singapore Judgment) <span class="font-italic">can be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">enforced</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>within <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction (here, the Maldives). The underlying premise, in other words, is that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">purpose</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>of <span class="font-italic">the EJD process </span>relates <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">enforcement</span> of judgments within the jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">in which the assets reside</span> and that, therefore, if the judgment creditor cannot satisfy the court that the judgment concerned <span class="font-italic">can</span>, in fact, be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">enforced</span> in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that</span> <span class="font-italic">particular jurisdiction</span>, then questions asked pursuant to the EJD process <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> pass legal muster and thus cannot be permitted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Even a cursory look at the language of O 48 r 1(1) (in particular, the phrase “whatever property the judgment debtor has and wheresoever situated” (emphasised in the Order which has been reproduced above at [3]) demonstrates that the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of the EJD process is <span class="font-italic">not</span> restricted to the <span class="font-italic">enforcement</span> of judgments <span class="font-italic">within the jurisdiction in which the relevant assets reside</span>. As the Judge clearly stated more than once in the GD, the EJD process is for the <span class="font-italic">central </span><span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">information gathering</span> on the part of the judgment creditor so as to determine how it might enforce the judgment (see the GD at [20], as well as at [26], [34] –[37]). This makes sense from a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">practical</span> <span class="font-italic">perspective</span>, especially in the context of the world as we know it today. In particular, with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the advent of technology, assets can be moved with ease across international borders; in particular, funds can be transferred almost instantaneously. The <span class="font-italic">physical</span> location of a judgment debtor’s assets, whilst important, can be changed almost in the blink of an eye. In this regard, the Judge noted (and accepted, rightly in our view) the respondent’s argument, as follows (see the GD at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As was argued by the respondent, information would be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">useful</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">even if</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">execution is not possible in the current location of the appellant’s assets</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Maldives) <span class="font-italic">as the assets</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may be moved, converted into other assets or generate income. </span><span class="font-italic">These </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could lead to other assets of funds</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">against which execution is available</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Indeed, <span class="font-italic">information</span> becomes of the first importance. This was a point that did not escape the notice of the Judge who observed thus (see the GD at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The EJD process is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">only</span> about <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">gathering information so that the judgment creditor may determine how enforcement should be pursued</span>. Questions irrelevant to this should certainly be excluded, <span class="font-italic">but it is</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">not irrelevant</span> <span class="font-italic">to determine</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">where</span><span class="font-italic"> assets</span> <span class="font-italic">may be situated</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">even if</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">judgment</span><span class="font-italic"> is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">not</span><span class="font-italic font-underline"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">enforceable in one jurisdiction</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this day and age</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>assets can certainly<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">be almost anywhere in the world</span>, and enforcement may be pursued in different <span class="font-italic">fori</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Limiting the EJD process as the appellant contended would be far too restrictive</span>. [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In summary, the fundamental flaw in the underlying premise of the appellant’s argument is that it has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">conflated</span> the concept of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">information gathering </span>pursuant to the EJD process with the concept of the actual <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">enforcement</span> of the relevant judgment abroad (see also the GD at [36] and [35], where the Judge observed that the appellant’s argument “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">elided</span> the information gathering process with the actual enforcement process” [emphasis added]). This is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to state that there can be no <span class="font-italic">overlap</span> between information gathering on the one hand and the actual enforcement process on the other. However, it is clear that the former is <span class="font-italic">broader</span> in scope than the latter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 As already noted, the concept of <span class="font-italic">information gathering</span> that is embodied in the EJD process is supported by the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">language</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of O 48 r 1(1) itself. We also agree with the Judge that there is nothing in Form 99 that detracts from this analysis. The language in Form 99 itself is neutral at best (see also the GD at [24]) and, in any event, O 48 r 1(1) is the “control centre” or governing provision and cannot be read as being subject to what is merely the prescribed form to facilitate its operation under this Order (see also the GD at [23]). We add that this particular construction of the language of O 48 r 1(1) is <span class="font-italic">not</span> mere arid literalism but (as noted above at [8]) is <span class="font-italic">consistent with</span> the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">purpose</span> of the EJD process in relation to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">information gathering</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In so far as the relevant <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">case law</span> is concerned, it is clear that the approach that the Judge adopted (and which we have endorsed) is wholly consistent with our decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span> as well as the decision of the AR in <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Harbor Advisors Pte Ltd and another v Tiny Tantono (representative of the estate of Lim Susanto, deceased) and another suit </span>[2015] SGHCR 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Harbor</span>”). In particular (and as the Judge pointed out (see the GD at [28])), our decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span> emphasises that EJD proceedings relate to information gathering and do <span class="font-italic">not</span> involve execution of the judgment concerned. While the fact situation in <span class="font-italic">PT Bakrie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was somewhat different, the <span class="font-italic">general principle </span>that can be drawn from the case itself is as we have just stated. As the Judge also noted (see the GD at [29]), <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Harbor </span>is also consistent with the approach just mentioned. The only authority which supports the appellant’s case is that of the AR in <span class="font-italic">IOB</span>. To the extent that it is inconsistent with our decision, it should not be followed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Consistent with our analysis, like the Judge (see the GD at [42]), we are of the view that whether or not there is a possibility that the Singapore Judgment could be enforced in the Maldives is immaterial and irrelevant to the outcome of the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 A <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">caveat</span> is necessary at this juncture: information gathering pursuant to the EJD process is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> a <span class="font-italic">licence for a fishing expedition </span>(which was one of the concerns raised by the appellant). Whether or not this is the case will depend on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the precise facts and circumstances</span> before the court. In this regard, the Judge observed as follows (see the GD at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I accepted that the information gathering process could not be so broad as to capture past assets, though there may be some possible connection to the availability of present assets. The respondent here did not make such an argument. It is necessary that the information obtained should not be too remote or divorced from eventual enforcement; the possibility of movement and identification of other assets or funds that may be available, is sufficiently closely connected. I did not think that there was anything to be gained by attempting to formulate a precise rule on the limits of questions which can be asked in EJD proceedings in relation to foreign assets: the observations of Reyes J in <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury International Ltd v Nouvelle Foods (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2005] 1 HKC 337 at [75], and cited in <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Harbor</span>, commend themselves:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There must be some line beyond which a creditor examining under O 48 may not tread. That line cannot be drawn with precision. It is undesirable fully to articulate its boundaries. That would needlessly constrain the flexibility inherent in O 48.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 We agree wholly with the observations just quoted. While legal principles can – and ought to be – articulated as clearly and coherently as possible, the <span class="font-italic">fact situations</span> to which they are at least potentially applicable are <span class="font-italic">myriad</span>. The <span class="font-italic">process</span> of <span class="font-italic">applying</span> the relevant <span class="font-italic">legal </span>principles to any given <span class="font-italic">fact</span> situation <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be the subject of a coherent predictive formula. This is both logical and commonsensical. The ultimate decision arrived at by the court concerned will (to reiterate the fundamental point already made) depend on <span class="font-italic">the precise facts and circumstances of the case at hand</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 We also deal with the appellant’s argument (raised in the High Court but not, correctly in our view, on appeal) that it would be against <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">comity</span> in requiring the questions concerned to be answered as there was an existing Maldivian judgment refusing enforcement of the Awards in the Maldives. We can do no better than to quote the Judge’s reasons as to why comity was <span class="font-italic">not </span>threatened, as follows (see the GD at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But these arguments on comity failed simply because comity was not threatened: the EJD proceedings only concerned the gathering of information, and did not by themselves constitute enforcement of the Singapore Judgment. It was hard to see how any impact could be felt in the Maldivian Action that would amount to interference or a disregard for the orders of the Maldivian court within its territory, whether or not any delay has been caused. The present proceedings and orders, did not clash at all with the Maldivian refusal to enforce the Awards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Finally, we also think it important to highlight that accepting the appellant’s submission would produce a number of undesirable implications<span class="font-italic"> </span>from a <span class="font-italic">practical</span> perspective. For instance, the issue of the enforceability of a Singapore judgment in a <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> jurisdiction is one that must necessarily be determined by a competent <span class="font-italic">foreign </span>court. For a Singapore court to pre-emptively decide whether a Singapore judgment is enforceable in a <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">before</span> a foreign court has to consider the issue, or, for that matter, <span class="font-italic">after</span> the foreign court has decided the issue, could result in inconsistent decisions across the two jurisdictions. Indeed, these would be clear examples of a breach of comity. Equally important is the position of a judgment creditor, who, at the time it seeks an EJD order, has not received satisfaction of the judgment debt. Permitting the judgment debtor to escape scrutiny of its assets on the basis that a Singapore judgment is not, at the material time, enforceable in the foreign jurisdiction, would serve as a perverse incentive for the judgment debtor to transfer its assets to the foreign jurisdiction in order to escape the necessary scrutiny that is inherent in an EJD proceeding (in this regard, see the observations by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">Bloomsbury International Ltd v Nouvelle Foods (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2005] 1 HKC 337 at [107] that “because the [judgment] debtor has committed a wrong in failing to pay, the Court must not be overly solicitous in his favour”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For the reasons set out above, we dismiss the appeal.
