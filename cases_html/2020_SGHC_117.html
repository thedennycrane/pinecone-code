Having inspected the original Debenture, WFS filed a Notice of Non-Admission (“the Notice”) as required by O 27 r 4(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). The trial commenced on 29 October 2019.

</div>
</div> In my view, this placed CIMB on notice to prove the Debenture’s authenticity at trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) established the following principles relating to the proof of documents: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A party is legally entitled to object to the authenticity of documents. It is entitled to insist that the documents be admitted in accordance with the proper rules of evidence (<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The general principle is that the party wishing to admit documents into evidence must comply with the provisions of the EA (<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [48]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The relevant provisions on the admission of documents include ss 63 to 67 of the EA (<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A party is generally deemed to admit authenticity unless he can bring himself within O 27 r 4(2) of the ROC by showing that he had issued a notice of non-admission within the requisite window of time (<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [73]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the court held that documents exhibited in a supplemental affidavit of evidence-in-chief had not been properly admitted in evidence because the plaintiff failed to adduce <span class="font-italic">primary evidence</span> of those documents (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the originals). This is required under s 66 of the EA, which provides that documents must be proved by primary evidence except where permitted under s 67 of the EA. Primary evidence is defined in s 64 of the EA as meaning “the document itself [is] produced for the inspection of the court”. The plaintiff failed to show that any of the exceptions for adducing <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, non-original documents) under s 67 of the EA applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The EA was amended in 2012. One amendment was the addition of s 67A. Section 67A of the EA provides that where a document is admissible under s 32(1), it may be proved by the “production of a copy of that document, or of the material part of it, authenticated in a manner approved by the court”. In other words, where a party satisfies one of the exceptions in s 32(1) of the EA, it may rely on a “copy” of that document. Section 66 must now therefore be read subject to s 67A. Notwithstanding the introduction of s 67A of the EA, the general principles expressed by the court in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, in my view, continue to be applicable. Although the present case does not centre on the provisions dealt with in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holdings (CA)</span>, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, ss 66 and 67, the principles articulated above at [26] are relevant to this dispute, which concerns ss 69(1) and 75(1) of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Even where primary evidence of a document is produced, its <span class="font-italic">authenticity</span> may be in issue. In other words, a party may still insist on the other party proving that the signature belongs to the person who is alleged to have signed it, <span class="font-italic">despite </span><span class="font-italic">that party having produced the original document</span>. This point is made clear by the learned authors of Sudipto Sarkar &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence </span>(Wadhwa &amp; Co, 16th Ed, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span>”) at 1248: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">There still remains the most important question, viz, the genuineness of the documents produced as evidence, ie, Is a document what it purports to be?</span> The production of a document purporting to have been signed or written by a certain person is no evidence of its authorship. Hence the necessity of rules relating to the <span class="font-italic">authentication </span>of documents, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, proving their genuineness and execution. Proof, therefore, has to be given of the handwriting, signature and execution of a document. In <span class="font-italic">Stamper v.

A writing, of itself, is not evidence of the one thing or the other. A writing, of itself, is evidence of nothing, and therefore is not, unless accompanied by proof of some sort, admissible as evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  In this regard, it is also apposite to cite the observations by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 417 (“<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding (HC)</span>”) that the mere production of the original document is not sufficient to prove what it purports to be (at [146]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The making, execution or existence of a document has, for instance, to be proven by the evidence of the person who made it or one of the persons who made it, or a person who was present when it was made. In <span class="font-italic">Deutz Far East (Pte) Ltd v Pacific Navigation Co Pte Ltd </span>[1989] 2 SLR(R) 392, the original log book was tendered to court for identification. The court held the log book inadmissible as the person responsible for the logbook who was the master of the vessel was not called as a witness to establish that the log book was the vessel’s log, that the signatures in the log were his and that he kept the log according to the statutory regulations. This decision demonstrates that a mere tender of even the original document is not enough. <span class="font-italic">Documents are not ordinar</span><span class="font-italic">ily taken to prove themselves or accepted as what they purport to be.

Instead, the provision merely embodies what is the universal rule in all cases: <span class="font-italic">he who mak</span><span class="font-italic">es an allegation must prove it</span> (<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span> at 1249). The general principle is that writing purporting to be of a certain authorship cannot be treated as genuine. There must be some <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> of its genuineness or its execution (at 1250). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 There are various ways to prove that a document is authentic and was signed by the person who is alleged to have signed it.

Section 75(1) of the EA is similar to s 73 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872. While s 75(1) of the EA expressly provides that the comparison can be done by the court, s 73 of the Indian Evidence Act is silent on who can undertake the comparison. However, the position under Indian law is clear that the comparison can be undertaken by the court (<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span> at 1307). Yet, Sarkar points out that the comparison should not <span class="font-italic">normally</span> be done by the court:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> Though, there has been no legal bar to the Judge using his own eyes to compare the disputed writings with the admitted writings; as a matter of prudence, <span class="font-italic">extreme caution</span>, <span class="font-italic">and judicial sobriety</span>, <span class="font-italic">the Court should not</span><span class="font-italic"> normally take upon itself the responsibility of comparing the disputed signatures with that of the admitted signatures or handwritings and hesitate to base its findings with regard to the identity of the handwritings solely on such comparison made by itself</span>.

</div> concerned two suits to rectify the share register of a company called Next Capital Pte Ltd (“NCPL”). In one suit, HRT Corporation (“HRT”), as plaintiff, claimed that the defendant, Wong, had agreed for it to hold 33% of the total shares in NCPL. The defendant alleged that this agreement was merely a non-binding understanding which was displaced by a subsequent agreement under which the plaintiff was entitled only to a 24.5% shareholding. To corroborate the subsequent agreement, the defendant relied on a share transfer form transferring only 24.5% of NPCL’s shares to the plaintiff. This form was allegedly witnessed by HRT’s sole director, Phuah. HRT filed a notice of non-admission in respect of the share transfer form. Citing s 69 of the EA, Quentin Loh J held that “since HRT has challenged the authenticity of the share transfer form, Wong had to produce the original <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">prove that the signature thereon was in fact Phuah’s</span>” [emphasis added]. Wong, however, failed to produce the original share transfer form. Neither did he prove that the signature belonged to Phuah. In the circumstances, the court found that HRT could not be taken to be aware that it had only been allocated 24.5% of the shares (<span class="font-italic">Yeoh Wee Liat</span> at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Raman Subbalakshmi Krishan v Indian Overseas Bank </span>[1994] SGHC 8, the plaintiff was the bank’s customer, and had purportedly signed two letters of authority. As the bank relied on these letters in its claim, the bank bore the burden of proof. Three bank officers testified on its behalf. The bank also called a senior scientific officer of the Department of Scientific Services. The officer examined the signatures on various documents, and ultimately concluded that the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff </span>had signed the letters. In other words, they were authentic documents. Having regard to the expert evidence, the court found that the plaintiff had signed the two letters of authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Bank of India v Dr Pravinchand P Shah </span>[1994] SGHC 276 (“<span class="font-italic">Bank of India</span>”), the bank claimed against the defendant under a guarantee. The defendant argued that the bank had failed to prove the guarantee as required under s 69 of the EA as it did not lead evidence of his signature. The plaintiff provided primary proof of the guarantee by producing it at the hearing. The defendant had admitted in a letter on 1 September 1987 that he was a guarantor to the bank but belatedly denied the existence of the guarantee on 9 September 1988. The court observed that s 69 of the EA does not prescribe the mode of proving the authenticity of a signature, and that the signature may be proved other than by direct evidence. Having regard to the defendant’s conduct, the court was satisfied that he had signed the guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol v The Great Eastern Life Assurance </span>[1998] SGHC 403 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol</span>”), the plaintiff claimed for wrongful termination. The defendant had terminated an agency agreement with the plaintiff on the basis that signatures on certain policy documents had been forged by the plaintiff. Despite the defendant calling an expert witness to prove that the signatures had been forged, and the plaintiff calling her own expert witness to prove that the signatures were not forged, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) found that the plaintiff had not breached the agency agreement by forging the policyholders’ signatures. In doing so, the court made the following observations: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is no requirement in law that the evidence of a handwriting expert must be corroborated. However, it would not be safe, even on a balance of probabilities, to conclude that the documents had been <span class="font-italic">forged</span>, especially where more direct evidence was available (<span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol </span>at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court should not compare signatures under s 75(1) of the EA especially when more direct evidence is available (<span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol </span>at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It was crucial to call the policyholders to testify as to their signatures, which was a matter so clearly within their knowledge (<span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol </span>at [91]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The defendant knew its burden at trial.

While it had produced the original Debenture, it failed to call Yong and Lim as witnesses. In my judgment, CIMB cannot prove the signatures’ authenticity merely by producing the original Debenture. It must also adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the relevant signatures contained in the Debenture belong to Yong and Lim. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [48], WFS has the right to insist on compliance with the EA provisions. This includes s 69 of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I also did not find it appropriate to exercise my discretion under s 75 of the EA to compare Yong and Lim’s signatures on the Debenture with their signatures on other documents. I am of the view that such comparison, ordinarily, requires expert evidence. Generally, the court is not equipped to compare signatures to ascertain their authenticity. In addition, the exercise of comparing signatures is not a matter for lay witnesses to perform, save where they are especially acquainted with the signatures in dispute. On this point, counsel for CIMB had asked Mr Tan during cross-examination to compare Yong and Lim’s signatures on the original Debenture with their signatures on other documents.

</div> However, Mr Tan is plainly not an expert on signatures. Nor is there any evidence that he was someone especially acquainted with Yong and Lim’s signatures. It was therefore inappropriate to allow counsel to embark on this line of questioning. I did not allow counsel to pursue this line of questioning.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 <span class="font-italic">Chua Kim Eng Carol</span> makes apparent that <span class="font-italic">even expert evidence</span> may be insufficient where more direct evidence is available (at [90]–[91]). In my judgment, the present case similarly called for such direct evidence. In this case, Yong and Lim’s evidence would constitute direct evidence. The question of their signatures’ authenticity was something so clearly within their knowledge. In this regard, CIMB’s explanation for failing to do so is wholly unsatisfactory. While Yong and Lim may be subject of investigations for wrongdoing against CIMB, this does not, by itself, mean that their evidence in court would have been unreliable. For CIMB’s purposes, Yong and Lim would have been required to testify on a single issue: did they sign the Debenture? This issue did not give them much room to be untruthful. Either they had signed it or they had not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the circumstances, CIMB took a calculated but ultimately ill-advised risk not to call Yong and Lim. I also take heed of the fact that CIMB had in HC/RA 306/2019, on 22 October 2019, asserted privilege in relation to communications with Yong in the period around August 2017 to February 2018.

</div> While I did not accept its assertion of privilege, this claim shows that CIMB was communicating with Yong from August 2017 to February 2018. Despite there being some recent history of communication between CIMB and Yong, CIMB failed to show that it had even <span class="font-italic">approached</span> Yong to testify as a witness. In addition, I found the tardy manner in which CIMB had produced the Debenture for WFS’ inspection – <span class="font-italic">one day before trial</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>– troubling. Hence, in the absence of Yong and Lim’s testimony, CIMB has failed to prove the authenticity of the Debenture.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I note that there is some suggestion that the Debenture produced at trial was only a draft.

In <span class="font-italic">Super Group Ltd</span>, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J dealt with the issue of whether certain emails, which the plaintiff relied on, were authentic. The plaintiff sought to prove this by relying on both direct evidence of fact and expert evidence (at [57]). In dealing with this issue, the court distinguished between the concepts of <span class="font-italic">authenticity </span>and <span class="font-italic">admissibility</span> (at [53]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Authenticity is a necessary condition of admissibility. It is true that formal proof of authenticity is commonly dispensed with in civil cases.

Evidence which has been fabricated is no evidence at all: it is incapable of proving anything other than, perhaps, the very fact that it has been fabricated. [emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In other words, a party must prove that a document is authentic before its admission can be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Court of Appeal endorsed the following definition of hearsay evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 and <span class="font-italic">Orion-One Development Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3556 (suing on behalf of itself and all subsidiary proprietors of Northstar @ AMK) and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 793 at [9]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he assertions of persons made out of court whether orally or in documentary form or in the form of conduct tendered to prove the facts which they refer to (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> facts in issue and relevant facts) …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Hence, a party seeking to admit documentary hearsay typically seeks to prove the truth of the contents referred to in the document that it seeks to admit.

The dispute does not concern the <span class="font-italic">truth of </span><span class="font-italic">the contents of the Debenture</span>. As I have mentioned above at [34], there are various ways that CIMB could have proven the authenticity of the Debenture. Even if CIMB decided to risk not calling Yong or Lim, whose evidence, as I pointed out above at [42] would have constituted “direct evidence” on the authenticity of the signatures, CIMB could have, at the very <span class="font-italic">least</span>, called an expert to testify on this point. An expert’s evidence, if unrebutted by any contrary testimony, could have provided a basis for accepting the original Debenture as authentic.

</div>
</div> It submits that, on a true construction of these clauses, the Debenture does not assign Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. First, cl 3.1(c) provides for the assignment of “all <span class="font-italic">Receivables</span> … relating to or arising from any and all <span class="font-italic">Goods</span> and <span class="font-italic">Relevant</span> <span class="font-italic">Agreements</span>…” [emphasis added]. “Goods” and “Relevant Agreements” are, however, restricted under cl 1 of the Debenture to matters which did not cover the subject matter of the Sales Transactions. Second, cl 3.1(d) assigns all “Contract Rights”, which WFS also argues did not cover the subject matter of the Subject Transactions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I find that Ms Khoo did not accept that CIMB was relying only on cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) of the Debenture as the basis of the assignment of Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents. While Ms Khoo may have made such a concession during cross-examination, she made it clear during re-examination that CIMB was also relying on cl 3.1(e) of the Debenture.

</div> Similarly, CIMB adopts this position in its written submissions and argues that cl 3.1(e) is the operative provision assigning Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents.

There is support for this proposition in the following extract from Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure </span>(Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 15.020: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rule is that “the effect of any document or the purport of any conversation referred to in the pleading must, if material, be briefly stated, and the precise words of the document or conversation shall not be stated, except in so far as those words are themselves material”. Therefore, the reference to the effect of the document or purport of the conversation should be brief. The actual words contained in the document or conversation should not be pleaded unless the words themselves have particular significance … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The language used in para 4 of CIMB’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2) makes plain that CIMB is relying on all the clauses under the Debenture which assigned to it Panoil’s rights, title, benefit and interest under the Sales Documents. Ultimately, cl 3.1 is the main operative provision assigning Panoil’s rights to CIMB. Naturally, it follows that CIMB is entitled to rely on the various sub-clauses therein in its claim against WFS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In any event, I find that WFS did not suffer any prejudice by CIMB’s failure to expressly plead cl 3.1(e). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Doka Formwork Pte Ltd v Grandbuild Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 248 (“<span class="font-italic">Doka Formwork</span>”), Andrew Ang SJ cited, at [57], the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1522 at [40] that the law permits a departure from the general rule of pleadings where no irreparable prejudice would be caused to the other party or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so. In this regard, the court has a “degree of discretion in allowing parties to rely on points that were not expressly or specifically pleaded”. Hence, even though the plaintiff had not pleaded the specific clauses under the contract which it was relying on, the court found that the defendant was not irreparably prejudiced by such failure as: (a) the contract itself was pleaded in the Statement of Claim; (b) the plaintiff’s reliance on the specific contractual clauses became clear when the affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed; (c) the plaintiff expressly referred to the contract clauses in its opening statement; and (d) the defendant had full opportunity during trial and closing submissions to question the plaintiff’s reliance on those contractual terms and make relevant submissions (<span class="font-italic">Doka Formwork </span>at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Similarly, CIMB had, in its Statement of Claim (Amendment No.2), expressly pleaded that it was relying on the Debenture.

</div> WFS also had the opportunity to make submissions on cl 3.1(e) after Ms Khoo referred to it during re-examination but failed to do so.

Unlike cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d), cl 3.1(e) does not capitalise the terms “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts”. While the terms “Receivables”, “Goods” and “Relevant Agreements” are specifically defined under cl 1 of the Debenture, the terms “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts”, which are not capitalised, are not. By not capitalising these terms, the parties must have intended to distinguish these terms from their capitalised equivalents under cll 3.1(c) and 3.1(d). Hence, the “contract rights”, “receivables” and “debts” under cl 3.1(e) are not restricted to their definitions under cl 1 of the Debenture. These terms must therefore be given their plain and ordinary meaning in accordance with the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation. In my view, it is clear that the language of cl 3.1(e) is sufficiently wide to include Panoil’s rights under the Sales Documents, these being present or future “contract rights” that were due and owing to Panoil.

In <span class="font-italic">Pan-United Shipping Pte Ltd v Cummins Sales and Services Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 198 at [83], Chan Seng Onn J observed that in a classic “battle of the forms” scenario, the “last shot” must be a counter-offer in order to destroy the original offer and constitute the new terms on which an agreement is formed, citing <span class="font-italic">Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd </span>[1979] 1 WLR 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Butler Machine</span>”), the leading decision on “battle of the forms”. In <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332, the Court of Appeal endorsed the analysis of the majority in <span class="font-italic">Butler Machine</span> that the court would examine each “shot” which was “fired” by the respective parties, and only find a concluded agreement when a final and unqualified acceptance has been made (at [63]). In this regard, it has been observed by Dyson LJ in <span class="font-italic">Tekdata Interconnections Ltd v Amphenol Ltd </span>[2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Tekdata</span>”) at [25] that while there is no general rule that applies in all cases where there is a “battle of the forms”, where A makes an offer on its conditions and B accepts that offer on its conditions and performance follows without more, the correct analysis is that there is a contract on B’s conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this case, it is common ground that the sales confirmation issued by <span class="font-italic">Panoil</span> was the final document sent before delivery of each parcel of fuel oil for each of the Subject Transactions.

These constitute the essential terms of the contract necessary for contractual formation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In establishing which documents governed the Subject Transactions, I also took the relevant commercial background into account (<span class="font-italic">R1 International </span>at [51]). In this respect, I accept Mr Neo’s evidence that it was industry practice to treat sales confirmations as embodying the contracts between the parties.

In my view, the abbreviation “COA” is plainly insufficient to show that the <span class="font-italic">2017 COA </span>governed a particular transaction, even if I accept that “COA” refers to a contract of affreightment. WFS also failed to call any witnesses from Panoil to testify that “COA” refers to the 2017 COA. If the parties had intended for a specific sales transaction to be governed by the 2017 COA, I would have expected a reference to the “2017 COA” or something to the effect that “the transaction is governed by the 2017 COA”.

This is for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 First, the transactions envisioned under the Umbrella Contracts do not correspond with the Subject Transactions <span class="font-italic">actually carried </span>out by the parties: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under the 2017 TA, WFS was obliged to provide Panoil with a sale confirmation and a purchase confirmation. However, there is no evidence that such documents were ever issued in relation to the 1st and 2nd Sales Transactions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, transactions under the 2016 COA involved job orders, sales confirmations, and purchase confirmations, which were to be issued by WFS to Panoil. Again, there is no evidence that these documents were ever issued to Panoil in respect of the 3rd Sales Transaction. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Likewise, transactions under the 2017 COA involved job orders, sales confirmations, and purchase confirmations. There is no evidence that these documents were issued by WFS to Panoil in respect of the 4th to 11th Sales Transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In contrast, in the case of the Subject Transactions, <span class="font-italic">WFS </span>would issue <span class="font-italic">Panoil </span>an <span class="font-italic">order confirmation</span>. Then, <span class="font-italic">Panoil </span>would issue <span class="font-italic">WFS </span>a <span class="font-italic">sales confirmation</span> (see above at [74]). In other words, the <span class="font-italic">only document</span><span class="font-italic">s </span>which <span class="font-italic">WFS </span>issued to <span class="font-italic">Panoil </span>for the Subject Transactions were <span class="font-italic">order confirmation</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>. Under the Umbrella Contracts, WFS was to issue sales confirmations and purchase confirmations. Further, save for the 2017 TA, the remaining Umbrella Contracts contemplated the issuance of  job orders. WFS, however, failed to produce <span class="font-italic">any of these documents</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>contemplated under the Umbrella Contracts in these proceedings. The lack of evidence makes clear that no such documents were ever issued and no transactions were carried out pursuant to the Umbrella Contracts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, there is no objective evidence that any of the transactions contemplated under the Umbrella Contracts had ever been carried out. The substance of the Umbrella Contracts was that WFS would sell the same quantity of fuel oil back to Panoil in a composite “buy-sell” transaction. There is no evidence that such transactions had ever taken place. Put a different way, there is no objective evidence that WFS had concurrently sold to Panoil the same quantity of fuel which it had bought from Panoil under the Subject Transactions. I do not accept Mr Tan’s assertions on affidavit, unsupported by objective documentary evidence, that there had been such buy-sell transactions with Panoil. In particular, I find it unbelievable that it was “generally not possible to track each Panoil purchase of … fuel oil from WFS to [a] particular sale from Panoil to WFS”. According to Mr Tan, on a monthly basis, WFS ensured that the volume of fuel oil sold<span class="font-italic"> </span>to and purchased<span class="font-italic"> </span>from Panoil tallied. In this respect, WFS entered into various contracts for the supply of fuel oil to end-user vessels or vessel owners. WFS performed such contracts by purchasing fuel oil from its suppliers, including Panoil. Panoil would then purchase the fuel oil from WFS for delivery to WFS’ customers, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the end-user vessels or vessel owners.

</div>
</div> In my view, these monthly “reconciliation statements” do not prove that there had been composite “buy-sell” transactions in respect of the Subject Transactions. At bottom, these “reconciliation statements” are internal financial documents prepared by WFS. They do not evidence that there had been “buy-sell” transactions under the Umbrella Contracts. WFS could have called witnesses from Panoil or, alternatively, produced the relevant documents contemplated under these contracts, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, purchase confirmations or sales confirmations or job orders, which it had issued to Panoil. If such transactions had been carried out, it is probable that WFS would retain copies of these documents. As I mentioned above at [105], WFS did not produce these documents in these proceedings. In the circumstances, I find that there were no composite “buy-sell” transactions in respect of the Subject Transactions. It follows that the Subject Transactions are not governed by the Umbrella Contracts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Third, I find that WFS and Panoil did not act in a manner consistent with the payment terms required under the Umbrella Contracts. Under the Umbrella Contracts, each party was required to pay the other within 15 days of the presentation of the sales invoice (for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, cl 7.3 of the 2016 COA, cl 10 of the 2017 TA and cl 8.4 of the 2017 COA). However, it is undisputed that WFS’ purchase confirmations in respect of the Subject Transactions all provided for payment to be made within 30 days.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Fourth, the terms of the Umbrella Contracts themselves show that the Subject Transactions were not governed by the Umbrella Contracts because they do not mention the dates, prices, payment mode, or indeed any other details. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Finally, even though CIMB was, at the time, a third party to the Subject Transactions between WFS and Panoil, I find this immaterial to the issue of which documents governed the 11 Sales Transactions. It is a well-established principle that contracts are appraised objectively. Applying this objective analysis, it is plain from the terms of the Umbrella Contracts that the Subject Transactions were not covered by these same documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Given the above, I find that the Subject Transactions were not governed by the Umbrella Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the 2014 Offset Agreement govern the Subject Transactions? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 WFS submits that the 2014 Offset Agreement includes all transactions between WFS and Panoil.

</div> This is because the 2014 Offset Agreement refers to the right to set off “any sums payable by any entity of Panoil to any entity of [WFS]” against “any amount payable that any entity of [WFS] has to any entity of Panoil”. It is not necessary for me to make a finding on whether the 2014 Offset Agreement governed the Subject Transactions, given my finding below that any rights of set-off arising from it would be superseded in any event by the rights under the Sales Documents (see below at [125]–[130]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is WFS entitled to a right of set-off? </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 CIMB submits that each of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations incorporates cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions.

</div> Given the common and usual nature of cl 8.2, it stands to reason that the requirement of “reasonable notice” is more easily satisfied.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Second, in determining what constitutes “reasonable notice”, I have regard to the fact that WFS is a sophisticated commercial party with a history of business dealings with Panoil. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Third, upon examination of the clause that seeks to incorporate cl 8.2, I find that reasonable notice was provided. Each of the 11 Sales Confirmations is a brief document, and did not spell out the terms of the contract of sale at length. Instead, as appears common with the bunkering practice, under the heading “terms” (as in terms of the contract), it provided that “sales [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] is subjected to the <span class="font-italic">standard terms and conditions of Panoil</span> which is updated from time to time” [emphasis added]. Evidently, this case should be distinguished from cases where the incorporating clause is printed in small and illegible print. The incorporating clause in each of the 11 Sales Confirmations is prominent and easily seen. Another point to note is that, other than the clause stipulating that the sale is subject to Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, there are only a few contractual terms listed under the heading “[a]dditional terms”. To any reasonable commercial party, it is obvious that all of the main contractual terms will be found in Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, given the bare bones nature of each sales confirmation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Finally, it is clear that WFS had <span class="font-italic">actual notice </span>of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions as the evidence shows that WFS possessed a copy of the same. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Loh conceded that WFS had a copy of one version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions that WFS disclosed in its List of Documents.

</div> While it is clear that there were different versions of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions (the copy which CIMB possessed differed from WFS’ copy), both versions presented to the court contained cl 8.2. It is also not WFS’ case that the version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions at the material time did not contain cl 8.2. Given WFS’ possession of the version of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, I find that WFS likely obtained a copy of the document from Panoil. Even if WFS did not have actual notice of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, it is, in any event, apparent that it had reasonable notice of those terms. Furthermore, even though the incorporating clause does not provide that Panoil’s Terms and Conditions were available on request, I do not think it was necessary for parties to include such a term given their commercial sophistication and history of business with each other. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cl 8.2 supersedes any set-off right arising under each of the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I have found that the Subject Transactions were governed by the 11 Sales Confirmations at [80]. The 11 Sales Confirmations incorporate cl 8.2, which does not allow any right of set-off. This extends to any rights of set-off which may arise under the Umbrella Contracts and/or the 2014 Offset Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Hence, even <span class="font-italic">if</span> at least one of the Umbrella Contracts or 2014 Offset Agreement covered each of the<span class="font-italic"> </span>transactions<span class="font-italic"> </span>between WFS and Panoil, the no set-off right under cl 8.2 supersedes any rights of set-off under these contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 <span class="font-italic">In Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd v OSK Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Sintalow</span>”), the parties signed a letter containing general terms and conditions for the purchase of sanitary ware (“the Master Contract”). The respondent later accepted three separate product quotations for the sanitary ware (“the Products Agreements”). The Court of Appeal held that the Master Contract merely prescribed general terms and conditions for the supply of the sanitary ware, but did not require the respondent to buy or the appellant to sell them. Instead, the sale and purchase of the products were governed by the separate Products Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The court explained the applicable approach where there is inconsistency between terms in different contractual documents:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A well-drafted contract normally provides a hierarchy of precedence to deal with inconsistencies between contractual terms or clauses, or general terms and specific terms (<span class="font-italic">Sintalow </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, if the contract does not expressly provide an order of precedence between the different documents or specify that a certain class of documents should prevail over others, “<span class="font-italic">the more specific document ought to prevail over a standard form document</span>” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Sintalow </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where there is no order of precedence clause stipulating the hierarchy between contractual documents, the terms of the sales contract, which contained the specifically agreed clause, take precedence over a clause incorporated by reference to the general terms and conditions (see <span class="font-italic">Indian Oil Corporation v Vanol Inc </span>[1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 634) (<span class="font-italic">Sintalow </span>at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The court should try to reconcile the terms to preserve the general terms. Only where there is a clear and irreconcilable discrepancy is it necessary to resort to the contractual order of precedence to resolve the inconsistency. Even where there is no order of precedence clause, the principle is that the general terms and conditions are superseded or varied by inconsistent specific terms and conditions to the extent of their inconsistency (<span class="font-italic">Sintalow </span>at [55]–[57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In this case, there is a clear inconsistency between the terms in the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement, and the 11 Sales Confirmations. The former contracts provide for rights of set-off, while the latter contracts expressly exclude any rights of set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Similar to the Products Agreements in <span class="font-italic">Sintalow</span>, the 11 Sales Confirmations were the <span class="font-italic">specific contractual documents</span> which governed each of the Subject Transactions. The 11 Sales Confirmations set out specific terms such as the price, mode of payment, date of delivery, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, which are not contained in the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement. Likewise, the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement, assuming that they governed the Subject Transactions, are akin to the Master Contract in <span class="font-italic">Sintalow</span>, these being documents lacking any of the specific details of each sales transaction. As there is a clear and irreconcilable inconsistency between the terms in these two sets of agreements, it is necessary to apply the principle that the terms in the more specific contract should prevail over the terms in the less specific contract. Hence, cl 8.2, which had been incorporated under the 11 Sales Confirmations, supersedes any rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts and the 2014 Offset Agreement (even if they were applicable to the Subject Transactions). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevance of the offset notices  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Given that WFS has no rights of set-off pursuant to the Umbrella Contracts and/or 2014 Offset Agreement, any offset notices issued by WFS have no legal effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 At trial, the evidence showed that WFS only began issuing these offset notices <span class="font-italic">after </span>it became clear that Panoil was in financial trouble.

On the contrary, Mr Asokan’s argument was, instead, based on the assumption that the words “without set-off” in cl 12.2 meant “without legal set-off”. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In our view, this was a pedantic as well as artificial argument that was wholly without merit, not least because it completely ignored the crystal clear language (“without set-off”) utilised by the parties which evinced their equally crystal clear intention, as seen in the entire context of the agreement itself, to exclude all manner of set-offs, both legal and equitable. </span>Indeed, Mr Asokan was <span class="font-italic">adding</span> to the words “without set-off” in cl 12.2 the word “legal” when the words “without set-off” were perfectly clear in stating what the parties had intended.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For convenience, I reproduce cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Payment for each delivery of marine fuel shall be in United States Dollars or Singapore Dollars as specified in the invoice and such payment shall be made by the Buyer free and clear of any deduction, set-off, counter claims, whatsoever on cash in advance or by telegraphic transfer to Seller’s bank after each delivery is completed as directed by Seller on the date shown on the invoice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Like the relevant clause in <span class="font-italic">Koh Lin Yee</span>, cl 8.2 expressly provides that payment for each delivery of marine fuel shall be made “free of any deduction, set-off, or counterclaim”.

</div> In this respect, WFS contends as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) CIMB has filed a proof of debt in the liquidation proceedings involving Panoil totalling US$4,234,596.00. CIMB, however, claims against Italmatic (the identity of which is not relevant) and WFS for a total of US$7,524,864.69 (excluding interest), which exceeds the amount filed in the proof of debt against Panoil.

There is no need for CIMB to establish that it has suffered “loss”, so long as it is entitled to exercise the assigned rights under the Debenture without any corresponding right of set-off by WFS. As I have found above at [113]–[142], WFS has no rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts and, in any case, any rights of set-off under the Umbrella Contracts (or the 2014 Offset Agreement) are superseded by cl 8.2 of Panoil’s Terms and Conditions, which is incorporated in each of the 11 Panoil Sales Confirmations. In any event, cl 10.4(d) of the Debenture expressly provides that CIMB may recover in excess of what Panoil has borrowed from it, except that such surplus “shall be paid to [Panoil] or any other person entitled thereto”. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As CIMB did not prove the authenticity of the Debenture, I dismissed its claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I will hear parties on costs.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Dedar Singh Gill   <br/>Judicial Commissioner   </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Kia Pheng, Samuel Lee Jia Wei and Tan Jia Hui (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Nair Suresh Sukumaran, Bryan Tan Tse Hsien and Bhatt Chantik Jayesh (PK Wong &amp; Nair LLC) for the defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
