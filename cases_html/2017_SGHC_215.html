The CPC also empowers the courts to enhance the imprisonment terms of such offenders in lieu of caning, by up to 12 months. Case law has not spoken with one voice on when an offender’s sentence should be enhanced in lieu of caning (“the enhancement question”), and if so enhanced, how the extent of such enhancement should be determined (“the duration question”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 These questions arose in the present appeal. At the conclusion of the oral arguments, we dismissed the appeal and gave brief reasons. We indicated that we would elaborate by furnishing detailed grounds for our decision. This we now do. In these written grounds, we provide guidance on both the enhancement question and the duration question. We first discuss the law and the current sentencing practice of the courts. We then set out the approach that should guide the courts in this context. We finally address the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3  Amin Bin Abdullah (“the Appellant”) was convicted of one charge of trafficking in 13.23g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. He also pleaded guilty to one charge of possession of 0.27g of diamorphine, an offence under s 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA and punishable under s 33(3) of the MDA. For the trafficking charge, he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. For the possession charge, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Appellant was later certified by a medical officer to be permanently unfit for caning. The learned district judge (“the District Judge”) then enhanced the original sentence by 30 weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. The Appellant appealed against this enhancement, contending that it was manifestly excessive. This required us to consider the applicable principles. Because we thought that the issues raised were somewhat complex, we appointed Mr Benjamin Koh Zhen-Xi (“Mr Koh”) as <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">micus curiae</span>.

It was introduced when the present CPC came into force on 2 January 2011, <span class="font-italic">vide</span> Criminal Procedure Code (Commencement) Notification 2010 (S 776/2010). During the Parliamentary debates, the Minister for Law explained that the underlying rationale was to “give the Court discretion in exercising parity between co-accused persons, one of whom may be caned and the other may not” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 It should be noted, however, that even though the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 CPC”) did not specifically provide for the sentences imposed on this category of exempted offenders to be enhanced, the courts did from time to time impose higher sentences on accused persons on account of the fact that they could not be caned. We set out some of the key cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cases decided under the 1985 CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 We begin with the 1991 decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huai and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huai</span>”). There, the appellant, a drug trafficker, was over the age of 50 and not liable for caning. The High Court imposed an additional three-year imprisonment term on the appellant on account of the exemption and sentenced him to 27 years’ imprisonment in total. The appellant’s co-accused, whose culpability was not dissimilar, received a sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the additional three years’ imprisonment, reasoning as follows (at [11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 231 [of the 1985 CPC] places the three categories of persons stated therein in a special position in that any provision in any law imposing a liability to caning would not be applicable to such persons. That being so, unlike the first appellant, the maximum penalty that the second appellant was liable for was therefore 30 years’ imprisonment (without any caning) and the minimum penalty was 20 years’ imprisonment (without any caning). The additional three years’ imprisonment imposed on the second appellant in lieu of the caning cannot be justified as the second appellant, <span class="font-italic">in the absence of any facts to distinguish his case from that of the first appellant’s</span>, must be sentenced to the same term of imprisonment as the first appellant for this offence. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 <span class="font-italic">Er Boon Huai</span> has been interpreted in different ways. Some have understood it to mean that it proscribes the imposition of an enhanced sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning: see <span class="font-italic">Mallal’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Criminal Procedure</span> (Noor Azman bin Adnan &amp; James Selladurai Thanjong Tuan gen eds) (LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2012) at para 1401. Others have seen it as standing for the proposition that an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning should not be ordered “in the absence of valid reasons”: see, for example, Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span>”) at paras 30.054–30.055. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The authors of <span class="font-italic">The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary</span> (Jennifer Marie &amp; Mohamed Faizal gen eds) (Academy Publishing, 2012) suggest at para 16.142 that <span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huai</span> was legislatively overruled by the enactment of s 325(2) of the CPC, but this has not been judicially explored. It may be noted that <span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Huai </span>was not referred to in the subsequent cases decided under the 1985 CPC, to which we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Seven years later, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) decided <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Jin Lie </span>[1998] SGHC 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Jin Lie</span>”). The 52-year-old accused in <span class="font-italic">Koh Jin Lie</span> pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted rape of a girl below 14 years of age, which was punishable with a sentence of between eight and ten years’ imprisonment, and a mandatory sentence of 12 strokes of the cane. Tay JC noted as follows (at [8]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my opinion, a sentence of imprisonment can and should be enhanced in appropriate cases, where caning is avoided for one reason or another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Nevertheless, Tay JC did not enhance the accused’s imprisonment term. He explained that he had proceeded in this way in order to preserve an incentive for accused persons like the offender in that case to plead guilty in such cases, because proving guilt at trial might otherwise be difficult and would almost certainly be stressful for the victim. Keeping in mind that the sentencing range available to him was between eight and ten years’ imprisonment, Tay JC reasoned that “[a] sentence which approaches the higher end of the scale would give little incentive for offenders like the present Accused to plead guilty” (at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Although no additional term of imprisonment was ordered in <span class="font-italic">Koh Jin Lie</span>, Tay JC had clearly endorsed the possibility of such enhancement and in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yap Siew Luan </span>[2002] SGHC 93 he did enhance the sentence where an offender was exempted from caning. There, the female accused pleaded guilty to importing into Singapore a controlled drug, an offence that carried a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Having decided that 22 years’ imprisonment would otherwise be the appropriate sentence for this accused, Tay JC added two years’ imprisonment in lieu of the 15 strokes of the cane (at [18]–[20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the next two cases, both of which were decided by Choo Han Teck J, the High Court declined to impose an imprisonment term in lieu of caning. The first of these is <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Kalathithara Subran Hilan and others </span>[2003] SGHC 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Subran</span>”), a case involving four accused persons. Two accused persons, one male and one female, pleaded guilty to the abetment of the rape of a 13-year-old girl. The male accused was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, and the female accused was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment. Choo J made it clear, without elaborating, that while he had considered increasing the sentence of the female offender in lieu of caning, he ultimately decided that “an adjustment upwards [was] not necessary” (at [5]). There was nothing in the decision to suggest that the female accused was less culpable than the male accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The second decision is <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat Bin Abdullah and another </span>[2003] SGHC 206, which concerned drug trafficking by two accused persons in a quantity that attracted a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Both accused persons were sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment, and the younger accused was also sentenced to 15 strokes of the cane. After observing that there was nothing very significant on the facts of the case to distinguish the sentences of the two accused persons, Choo J considered whether the sentence of the older accused should be enhanced in lieu of caning. He decided that given the age of the older accused person (59 years old) and his sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment, no enhancement was necessary (at [10]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cases decided under the current CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 We turn to the more recent cases decided under the current CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Krishnasamy s/o Suppiah </span>[2011] SGDC 321 (“<span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span>”) was decided by See Kee Oon SDJ (as he then was). <span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span> involved a 52-year-old offender convicted of two counts of drug consumption (together with a possession charge which is not material for our purposes). The offender had been charged once in November 2010 and subsequently reoffended while on bail. These two drug consumption charges carried minimum sentences of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 See SDJ sentenced the accused to seven years’ imprisonment for the first charge, and eight years’ imprisonment for the second charge. In relation to the second charge, See SDJ noted the availability of s 325(2) of the CPC, but did not, in the event, invoke that provision to justify the imposition of the higher sentence of eight years’ imprisonment, which was above the minimum sentence. Instead, he justified this on the ground that the accused had reoffended while on bail (at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In 2016, Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) delivered two High Court decisions on s 325(2) of the CPC, namely <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai </span>[2016] 3 SLR 347 (“<span class="font-italic">Nguyen</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini a/p Paramesuvaran </span>[2016] 3 SLR 261 (“<span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span>”). These cases were relied on by the Prosecution in the present appeal. Both involved female drug importers whose (unrelated) offences attracted minimum sentences of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. In both cases, Tay J invoked s 325(2) of the CPC and enhanced the sentences of both accused persons by the maximum 12 months’ imprisonment. In <span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16], Tay J reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In respect of the present charge, the MDA prescribes a mandatory sentence of 15 strokes of the cane. That being the case, the court should consider imposing an additional imprisonment term in respect of offenders who are exempted from caning <span class="font-italic">unless there are special circumstances that justify doing otherwise</span>. <span class="font-italic">The purpose is to deter individuals</span>, to whom this exemption applies, from importing or trafficking in drugs. Anecdotal evidence suggests that caning is regarded by would-be offenders as one of the most dreaded forms of punishments. The mandatory number of strokes for the present offence is 15, which is significantly high considering that the maximum number of strokes that can be inflicted on an offender at any one time is 24. Given the severity of the mandatory punishment of 15 strokes of the cane which this offence attracts, the maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment should be added if the accused person is exempted from caning. In this case, no special circumstances exist to justify otherwise. This approach must be taken so that such exempted accused persons have less incentive to be involved in the movement of drugs. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A similar approach was taken in <span class="font-italic">Nyugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my opinion, the court should consider imposing an additional imprisonment term in respect of offenders who are exempted from caning <span class="font-italic">unless there are special circumstances that justify doing otherwise</span>. As I have stated in <span class="font-italic">PP v </span><span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini a/p Paramesuvaran</span> [2016] 3 SLR 261, which also concerned the unauthorised importation of a controlled drug by a female and which was heard one day before the present case, <span class="font-italic">the purpose is to deter individuals to whom this exemption applies from being involved in the drugs trade</span>. The most dreaded form of punishment is probably caning. For the present offence, caning is not discretionary and it is set at 15 strokes, which is significantly high considering that the maximum number of strokes that can be inflicted on an offender at any one time is 24. Given the severity of the mandatory punishment of 15 strokes of the cane for non-exempted offenders, the maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment should be added if an offender is exempted from caning, even if an additional 12 months might not appear to make a big difference when viewed against the minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. In this case, I see no special circumstances to justify otherwise. This is to ensure that such exempted persons have less incentive to be involved in the drugs trade. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25  A number of points of interest arise from these passages. First, they suggest that where the offender is exempted from caning, the sentence of imprisonment should be enhanced “unless there are special circumstances that justify doing otherwise”. Second, this was thought to be justified by the principle of deterrence. Third, Tay J meted out the maximum enhancement of 12 months’ imprisonment, even though the accused persons had been exempted from 15 strokes of the cane (rather than the maximum of 24). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The principle enunciated in these decisions, that “the court should consider imposing an additional imprisonment term in respect of offenders who are exempted from caning unless there are special circumstances that justify doing otherwise”, has been adopted in subsequent cases. In <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Razak bin Bashir </span>[2017] SGHC 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Razak</span>”), the accused<span class="font-italic"> </span>faced a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The accused in <span class="font-italic">Razak</span> was a 52-year-old male drug trafficker who was exempted due to his age. In considering the additional sentence to be imposed due to the accused’s exemption from caning, Woo Bih Li J referred to <span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span> and said as follows (at [23]–[24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23  As a matter of general principle, I agreed that an additional sentence of imprisonment should be imposed in lieu of caning to deter individuals who are covered by s 325(2) CPC from trafficking unless there are special circumstances to justify otherwise. Furthermore, the additional sentence of imprisonment is a substitute for the additional punishment of caning which would otherwise have been imposed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24  However, as the prescribed punishment for the first charge was 15 strokes of the cane and this was not the maximum which an offender could have been facing, I was of the view that I should calibrate the additional sentence of imprisonment.

It should first be noted that the exemption under s 328(1) read with s 328(6) is of caning in excess of the specified limit of 24 strokes (in the case of an adult) or 10 strokes of the cane (in the case of a juvenile). Such an offender will be caned (assuming no other ground for exemption applies), but only up to the limit. It is perhaps unsurprising in the circumstances that in both the High Court cases that have considered the provision, the judges decided not to enhance the sentence of imprisonment on account of the additional strokes of the cane that the offenders were exempted from. The first case, <span class="font-italic">Public</span><span class="font-italic"> Prosecutor v BMD </span>[2013] SGHC 235 (“<span class="font-italic">BMD</span>”), concerned an accused person, aged 40, who was convicted of six charges of various sexual offences. He was sentenced to a global sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. But for the 24-stroke limit specified in s 328(6) of the CPC, he would have been sentenced to 42 strokes of the cane. Nevertheless, Tay J “did not think it necessary” to invoke s 328(2) of the CPC and impose an imprisonment term in lieu of caning “[i]n view of the totality of the sentence”, which he considered to be “adequate punishment” (at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The next case was <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BNN </span>[2014] SGHC 7.

But for the 24-stroke specified limit, he would have received 55 strokes of the cane. Nevertheless, Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) decided not to impose an additional imprisonment term on the accused under s 328(2) of the CPC. Tan JC found that the accused person’s sentence of 32 years’ imprisonment with the specified limit of 24 strokes was “sufficient for [his] vile criminal conduct” ([95]–[97]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 332(2) of the CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, we turn to s 332(2) of the CPC –– the provision directly implicated in this case –– and the relevant case law.

A change was made when s 332 of the CPC was adapted from its immediate predecessor, s 233 of the 1985 CPC, when the present CPC came into force on 2 January 2011 (see [10] above).

For the rape and robbery offences, he was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, and three years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, respectively. The two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Subsequently, the accused was found unfit for caning. The prosecution, citing <span class="font-italic">Nguyen</span>, sought the maximum 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. The accused argued that there should be no enhancement in respect of the 12 strokes of the cane ordered for the robbery charge given the low level of violence inflicted and low value of items taken. As for the six strokes of the cane for the rape offence, the accused submitted that an enhancement of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. Choo J ordered an enhancement of 12 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In view of the absence of detailed grounds for these two decisions, it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons or conclusions, save to say that having regard only to the outcomes in <span class="font-italic">Riduan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ow</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Hoe</span>, given that both cases concerned rape and involved broadly similar initial sentences, the enhancement of the offender’s sentence in one but not the other seems somewhat at odds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We turn to decisions of the State Courts.

He was subsequently found to be unfit for caning and his sentence of imprisonment was enhanced by six months. In arriving at this decision, the district judge considered “the reason why the accused was not fit for caning and whether it was appropriate for the court to exercise judicial mercy and remit the sentence of caning” (at [7]). It appeared to us that although it was not framed precisely in this way, the district judge proceeded on the basis that the accused person’s sentence should be enhanced in lieu of caning, unless there was a reason to do otherwise. The accused’s appeal to the High Court against sentence was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  <span class="font-italic">Abdullah </span>and <span class="font-italic">Song Hui</span>, on the other hand,<span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned offences under the Moneylender’s Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MLA”). The accused persons had committed acts likely to cause annoyance to house occupants in connection with unlicensed loans, for example, by splashing paint on the door of the occupant’s unit and defacing nearby walls with an indelible marker. Under ss 28(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 28(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the MLA, each charge was punishable with a fine of between $5000 to $50,000, an imprisonment term of up to five years and between three to six strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The accused person in <span class="font-italic">Abdullah</span>, who pleaded guilty to three such charges and another less serious charge under the MLA, was sentenced to a total sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. He<span class="font-italic"> </span>was subsequently sentenced to a further term of nine weeks’ imprisonment in lieu of the nine strokes of the cane (one week’s imprisonment per stroke that was avoided). Upon the prosecution’s appeal, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdullah Bin Abdul Rahman </span>Magistrate’s Appeal No 255 of 2011 (3 October 2012) increased the accused’s term of imprisonment to a total sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment, but the district judge’s order on enhancing the accused’s sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning was not disturbed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Lastly, the accused person in <span class="font-italic">Song Hui</span> faced four charges under s 28(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), punishable under ss 28(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 28(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the MLA. He was originally sentenced to a total of 24 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

However, on the duration question, the district judge in <span class="font-italic">Song Hui </span>explained (at [17]) that “for ease of application”, a pro-rated approach was used, in that the maximum additional term of imprisonment of 12 months was divided by the maximum number of strokes of the cane for adults (24 strokes) to arrive at a tariff of half a month’s imprisonment per stroke exempted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Observations on the current state of the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It will be apparent from the foregoing discussion that the sentencing practice in relation to the enhancement of sentences in lieu of caning has not been consistent in relation to either the enhancement question or the duration question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In relation to the enhancement question, courts have accorded different weight to factors such as the offender’s age and the length of the original sentence. Even more fundamentally, courts have differed on the appropriate starting point. Broadly speaking, there appear to be two approaches, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That an additional sentence should be imposed, unless there are “special circumstances” to justify not doing so (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span><span class="font-italic">, Nguyen </span>and <span class="font-italic">Razak</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That an additional sentence will only be imposed if there are grounds to warrant imposing it (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">Subran</span><span class="font-italic">, BMD</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ow</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Hoe</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Similarly, different approaches have been taken to the duration question. Two distinct approaches from the case law were helpfully distilled by the Prosecution in its submissions, and we will adopt the same terminology. The first was called the “pro-rated approach”, where typically two weeks’ imprisonment may be imposed in lieu of each stroke of the cane foregone. The second approach, labelled the “severity approach”, sees a longer term of imprisonment than the pro-rated approach to reflect the deterrent effect that may be lost from the exemption of caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There were further differences in the application of the severity approach. Tay J in <span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Nguyen </span>imposed the maximum 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of 15 strokes of the cane, while Woo J in <span class="font-italic">Razak</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>imposed nine months’ imprisonment in lieu of the same number of strokes of the cane. Woo J noted (at [24]) that 15 strokes of the cane was not the maximum, and thus considered it appropriate to “calibrate the additional sentence of imprisonment”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Given the diversity of views and approaches to these issues, we considered it appropriate to settle these points. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">The enhancement question</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate starting point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In our judgment, the correct starting point is that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced, unless there are grounds to justify doing so. Through ss 325(1), 328(1) and 331 of the CPC, Parliament has legislated to treat certain categories of offenders differently from others. Thus, women, men over the age of 50, those already sentenced to the maximum number of strokes of the cane at a single sitting of the court and those deemed medically unfit for caning are categories of offenders who are exempted from part or all of the caning to which they would or might otherwise have been sentenced. This reflects a legislative choice. There has been no suggestion in the present case that such a choice was irrational or otherwise legally suspect or indefensible. In any event, this point was considered and disposed of by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129 at [102]–[116]. The question for us, therefore, was whether the court should proceed on the presumptive basis that once an offender is exempted from caning, his sentence of imprisonment should be enhanced. We did not think so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We first note that the relevant provisions are all worded as open-ended discretion-conferring provisions. On a plain reading of the provisions, the courts have been given the discretion to enhance the sentences for the exempted offenders. What this means is that the courts have the power to impose additional imprisonment for such offenders. There is no mandatory requirement that this power be exercised, even where the caning would have been a mandatory part of the sentence, but for the exemption. Perhaps the clearest example of this is s 332(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC (see at [34] above), which is explicit that the court may remit the sentence. But even aside from this, the relevant provisions are all worded in terms that confer a discretion rather than impose an obligation. In such circumstances, the starting point in our judgment is that the discretion to enhance the term of imprisonment should only be exercised if there are grounds to justify doing so. Hence, as a general matter, the sentence should not be enhanced until and unless the sentencing judge has considered the matter and concluded that there are grounds to warrant it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Prosecution, relying on <span class="font-italic">Nguyen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above at [24]), submitted that the courts should impose additional imprisonment in lieu of caning “as the default position unless exceptional circumstances warrant a departure from such norms”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 With respect, we did not accept this submission because it is not consistent with the way in which the relevant sections are worded. The sections are not framed in terms that suggest that the imprisonment sentence <span class="font-italic">shall</span> be enhanced in such circumstances, even though Parliament could easily have done so. One example where Parliament had done just that, as pointed out by Mr Koh, was in s 67 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed), which provides that a person convicted of driving while under the influence of drink or drugs shall, “unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise”, be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In fact, Parliament uses similar language in the CPC itself. Section 304(1)–(2) of the CPC provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Corrective training and preventive detention</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">304.</span>—(1) Where a person of the age of 18 years or above —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he reached the age of 16 years for offences punishable with such a sentence; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) is convicted at one trial before the High Court or a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted and sentenced in Singapore or elsewhere to imprisonment for at least one month since he reached the age of 16 years for an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should receive training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the court, <span class="font-italic">unless it has special reasons for not doing so</span>, shall sentence him to corrective training for a period of 5 to 14 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where a person of the age of 30 years or above —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least 3 times since he reached the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least 2 of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) is convicted at one trial before the High Court or a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted and sentenced in Singapore or elsewhere to imprisonment for at least one month since he reached the age of 16 years for an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the court, <span class="font-italic">unless it has special reasons for</span><span class="font-italic"> not doing so</span>, shall sentence him to preventive detention for a period of 7 to 20 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In our judgment, the choice of legislative language in the context of the case at hand strongly pointed to the conclusion that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so. Furthermore, it is also material that the relevant provisions in the present case each apply in contexts that are slightly different and with consequences that are similarly distinct. Section 325(1) of the CPC provides for an absolute prohibition for certain classes of offenders; s 328(1) exempts the offender from caning beyond the specified limit, but ordinarily the offender will suffer the maximum permitted number of strokes; and s 332 applies where an offender is found to be medically unfit to suffer some or all of the strokes to which he has been sentenced. These differences militate against the conclusion that the correct approach is to begin with a common default position that the sentence of imprisonment should be enhanced in the absence of some special circumstances.  This also coheres better with the fact that the courts should not, in general, exercise punitive powers absent sufficient justification. As we noted above, all these considerations will require the court in each case to consider the circumstances that are before it and then decide whether enhancement is called for. We turn to identify a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in this context.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant factors to be considered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We considered that the following factors may warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The need to compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption. We note in passing that this was the principal consideration that underlay the reasoning of the court in <span class="font-italic">Kisshahllini</span> and in <span class="font-italic">Nguyen</span> (see [23] and [24] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The need to maintain parity among co-offenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, even if these factors are present, as they often will be, that does not necessarily mean that enhancement of the exempted offender’s sentence will be warranted. The court should instead consider the matter holistically and assess whether there are any factors which could militate against the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment. A non-exhaustive list of such factors would include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Medical grounds;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Old age;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Compassionate grounds;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The need for proportionality; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Parliamentary intention in enacting a sentencing regime for a given offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We elaborate on these factors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"><span class="font-italic">Factors that may warrant an enhancement of sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 A sentence of caning may be imposed to meet the sentencing objectives of deterrence and/or retribution (see <span class="font-italic">Chia Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor </span>[1992] 1 SLR 361 at [17]; and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Rohaizad bin Rosni </span>[1998] 3 SLR 804 at [37]). When an offender is exempted from caning, the court will generally find it helpful to first identify the principal sentencing objective(s) that underlie(s) the imposition of caning for the offence in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For example, in cases where there is a specific victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration, especially where violence has been visited upon the victim: see <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 06.021 and 30.023.

In some instances, both sentencing principles may simultaneously be substantially engaged, for instance where serious injury has been caused to the victim of a moneylending offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Having identified the dominant sentencing objective(s), the court should consider whether the objective(s) in question would be furthered by the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(1) The need to maintain deterrence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Where the need for deterrence has been identified as the dominant sentencing principle behind the imposition of caning, there are at least two factors that should be taken into account in determining whether an enhanced term of imprisonment will further the objective of deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, the court should consider whether an additional term of imprisonment is <span class="font-italic">needed</span> to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning, having regard to <span class="font-italic">why </span>the offender was exempted from caning. We are here addressing, in particular, the sentencing objective of general deterrence which looks to deter other like-minded individuals, who are similarly situated as the offender before the court, from engaging in similar conduct. The key question is whether such potential offenders would have known before committing the offence that by reason of their own circumstances, they would be exempted from caning. If so, then an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning may be more readily seen as necessary or appropriate in order to compensate for the general deterrent effect lost because the offender knows he or she will be exempted from caning. If, on the other hand, the exemption was unexpected in the circumstances, then there would not be a similar need to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning because the <span class="font-italic">prospect </span>of caning would nonetheless have been contemplated by such would-be offenders, even if it might subsequently transpire that they will not be caned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67  In general, an offender who was exempted from caning due to gender or age is likely to have known from the outset that he or she would not be caned. Therefore, for this class of exempted offenders, an additional term of imprisonment will be more readily seen to be called for, in order to compensate for the lost deterrent effect of caning. Conversely, an offender who was exempted from caning on medical grounds is less likely to have known that he would not be caned. Therefore, it would generally not be necessary to enhance the sentences of such offenders. So too might be the position with offenders who will receive the permitted limit of strokes but are exempted only from further strokes beyond this limit. Of course, these are mere guidelines, and each case must be decided on its own facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, the court should consider whether an additional term of imprisonment would be <span class="font-italic">effective</span> in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. In the context of whether a deterrent sentence should be imposed, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 240 observed as follows (at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a counterpoint to the intuitively appealing assumption of the hydraulic proportional relationship between sentences and criminal behaviour, some have suggested that it is beliefs about the probability of detection rather than the quantum of punishment which are more likely to influence human behaviour (Andrew Ashworth, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing and Criminal Justice</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2005) at para 3.3.2). On this note, it should be highlighted that <span class="font-italic">it is desirable in the interest of fairness to offenders sought to be made an example of, that “deterrent sentences” are buttressed by reasonable grounds for the supposition that the example will have the result intended</span>: Eric Stockdale and Keith Devlin, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing </span>(Waterlow, 1987) at para 1.70. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Similarly, when considering whether to enhance an offender’s sentence to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning, the court should consider whether there are reasonable grounds for thinking that the enhancement would have the effect intended. A key factor in this context is the length of imprisonment that the offence already carries. For example, if an offence carries a long minimum term of imprisonment, it is less likely to be the case that an enhancement of the sentence (such enhancement being limited to an additional 12 months’ imprisonment) in lieu of caning would likely provide an effective or meaningful deterrent to would-be offenders having regard to the sentence already prescribed for the offence. The marginal deterrent value of additional imprisonment would generally diminish in relation to the length of the original contemplated term of imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(2) The need to achieve due retribution</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Where retribution is the dominant sentencing objective behind the imposition of caning, then the need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning lost by reason of the exemption would be a factor militating in favour of enhancing the offender’s sentence. As a general observation, and in line with what we have said at [69] above, the weight of this factor should be considered with reference to the length of the existing sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(3) An illustrative example of enhancement to give effect to sentencing objective(s)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 We digress to refer to a recent case that illustrates when a court might enhance an offender’s sentence to give effect to the sentencing objective(s) of deterrence and/or retribution. <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Leong and another appeal </span>[2017] SGHC 188 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong</span>”) is a decision of See Kee Oon J that was delivered after the present case was decided. It concerned an aesthetic doctor who committed sexual offences against his patient, who was also the accused’s business partner and a fellow doctor. The accused was charged with three counts of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”) and two counts of causing hurt by means of administering stupefying drugs with intent to commit outrage of modesty, an offence under s 328 of the PC. The district judge acquitted the accused of one charge under s 354(1) of the PC (“the first charge”) and convicted him of the remaining four charges. The accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for each charge under s 354(1) of the PC, and 30 months’ imprisonment for each charge under s 328 of the PC, with two of the sentences (one from each type of offence) to run consecutively for an aggregate sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment. The accused appealed against his conviction and sentence on the four charges, while the prosecution cross-appealed against his acquittal on the first charge, and sought higher sentences for the remaining four charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 On appeal, See J convicted the accused of the first charge, and upheld his conviction on the four remaining charges. The accused’s sentences for each s 354(1) charge was increased to 14 months’ imprisonment, while his sentences for each s 328 charge was increased to 40 months’ imprisonment, for an aggregate sentence of 54 month’s imprisonment with the same two imprisonment terms running consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 What is particularly relevant for the present purposes is See J’s reasoning in respect of the s 354(1) charges. See J noted (at [89]) that the benchmark sentence for offences under s 354 of the PC involving intrusion of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs is nine months’ imprisonment and <span class="font-italic">three strokes of the cane</span>. The accused, whose offences fell within this category, could not be caned as he was above the age of 50. See J therefore had to consider whether the accused’s sentences should be enhanced under s 325(2) of the CPC. He began by identifying both deterrence and retribution to be relevant objectives in sentencing s 354(1) offences involving medical professionals (at [90]). See J then enhanced the accused’s sentence for the s 354(1) charges by two months per charge in the light of “[t]he need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence” given the “substantial aggravating factors” in this case (at [91]). <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Leong </span>is thus an illustrative case of when an offender’s sentence may be enhanced to give effect to the dominant sentencing objective(s).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(4) Parity between co-offenders</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As noted above (at [10]), one of the stated legislative reasons for enacting ss 325(2) and 328(2) of the CPC was to give the courts the discretion to achieve parity between co-accused persons. The courts have long endorsed the principle of parity, which urges that sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common criminal enterprise should not generally be unduly disparate from each other in the absence of relevant differentiating factors: see for example<span class="font-italic"> Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] SGHC 25 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Han Rui</span>”) at [1]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ramlee and another action </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 95 at [7]. Thus, the need to achieve parity between co-offenders will likely be a relevant factor when the court considers enhancing the prison sentence of an exempted offender who committed an offence alongside a co-offender who is liable for caning. In such a scenario, if the court declines to enhance the sentence of the exempted offender, this should be sufficiently explained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It may be noted that the principle of parity, which applies as between co-offenders who are parties to a common criminal enterprise, is distinct from the general principle of consistency in sentencing. As was explained in <span class="font-italic">Chong Han Rui </span>at [47], the parity principle rests on the need to preserve and protect public confidence in the administration of justice, and “where co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise are sentenced in an unduly disparate manner, the sentences would then seem to be arbitrarily imposed and this raises fundamental rule of law concerns”. The same considerations do not apply in precisely the same way outside the context of co-offenders in a common criminal enterprise. However, in considering whether to enhance the prison sentence of offenders, it would be desirable for sentencing courts to consider the need for general consistency and to achieve this by applying the sentencing guidelines laid down in these written grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"><span class="font-italic">Factors that militate against an enhancement of sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 We turn to the factors that might militate against the enhancement of the sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(1) Medical grounds </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The court should be mindful of medical grounds as a possible reason for not<span class="font-italic"> </span>enhancing the offender’s sentence. In <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2016] 2 SLR 78 (“<span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span>”) the court identified (at [38]) two ways in which ill health might be relevant to sentencing. First, ill health could be relevant as a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy in truly exceptional cases. Second, it could be relevant as a mitigating factor where an imprisonment term will have a markedly disproportionate impact on an offender by reason of his ill health. These same considerations should also inform the court’s decision in deciding whether to enhance the sentence of an exempted offender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that an offender has a medical condition that caused him to be exempted from caning under s 331 of the CPC is not in and of itself a factor against the enhancement of his sentence, <span class="font-italic">unless </span>the considerations outlined in <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun </span>are engaged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(2) Old age</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 3 SLR 180 at [94] provided the following guidance on sentencing offenders who are of old age:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The critical point is to assess whether, by reason of his age, the [offender] would suffer disproportionately from such a term of imprisonment unless some moderation was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 A similar consideration would apply in considering whether to enhance the prison sentence of an elderly offender, especially where he is already subject to a lengthy prison term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(3) Compassionate grounds </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The court should also consider whether there are any compassionate grounds not to enhance the offender’s sentence. For example, if an offender was certified medically unfit for caning during the execution of his sentence of caning (after some strokes had been inflicted), the court might be more inclined not to enhance the imprisonment sentence. This might be done in recognition not only of the fact that the offender had been caned (albeit for a lesser number of strokes), but also the fact that he had lived in fear and apprehension of being caned for the original number of strokes that had been imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(4) Proportionality </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The requirement of proportionality –– a principle that “runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions” (<span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [47]) –– is also relevant in the present context. The court should have regard to whether an enhancement of the offender’s sentence will cause the aggregate sentence to be disproportionate to the totality of the offender’s criminal behaviour. If the court is of the view that enhancement would cause the aggregate sentence to be disproportionate, it may either opt not to enhance the sentence at all, or to enhance the sentence to a lesser extent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(5) Parliamentary intention </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Lastly, the court should also have regard to Parliament’s intention in enacting a particular sentencing regime, and consider whether imposing an additional term of imprisonment would be consistent with and would advance that intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 This factor in the analysis ultimately depends on the circumstances of each sentencing regime, and may potentially urge or militate against an enhancement of sentence. However, it is particularly relevant for immigration offences, where Parliament has made clear its intention to reduce the term of imprisonment for such offenders in order to manage Singapore’s prison capacity. For example, ss 6 and 15 of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed), which criminalise illegal entry to Singapore and overstaying in Singapore without a permit respectively, include certain offences that carry a minimum sentence of three strokes of the cane: see ss 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Immigration Act. In 1995, Parliament capped the imprisonment term for both offences at six months. The rationale for this amendment was explained by then Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (1 November 1995) vol 65 at col 78) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clauses 3 and 5 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill seek to amend section 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and section 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to remove the mandatory minimum three months' jail term and to cap the maximum imprisonment term for illegal entry and overstaying at six months. There are two reasons for this. <span class="font-italic">First, we do not want these foreigners to clog up our jails.</span> As at 30th September this year, our prison capacity was exceeded by more than 36%. Immigration offenders constituted more than half, i.e., 67.4% to be exact, of the 2,787 foreign prisoners. <span class="font-italic">Secondly, by freeing up the jails, we will be able to prosecute more immigration offenders who may otherwise have to be let off the hook due to the prisons' limited capacity</span>. The mandatory caning provision will remain unchanged as caning has proved to be very effective; hardly any immigration offender who has been caned returns to Singapore. For persons who are not liable to be caned under our laws, that is, women and men above 50 years old, we have provided for them to be fined up to $6,000 instead. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The provisions referred to in the Minister’s speech that address the position of persons who are not liable to be caned under our laws are ss 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Immigration Act. These provisions make it clear that where an offender is exempted from caning by virtue of s 325(1) of the CPC, the offender should, in lieu of caning, be punished with a fine. Consistent with this, s 325(2) of the CPC, which ordinarily empowers the court to enhance the sentence of imprisonment, is “[s]ubject to any other written law”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As to other categories of exempted offenders who commit offences under ss 6(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Immigration Act, while the court retains the power to enhance the offender’s sentence, it should be slow to do so, taking due account of Parliament’s intention to reduce the terms of imprisonment for such offences.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the enhancement question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In summary, in deciding whether to enhance an exempted offender’s sentence in lieu of caning, the appropriate starting point is that no enhancement should be ordered unless there are grounds to do so. Possible grounds for such enhancement include the need to compensate for the deterrent and/or retributive effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption, and the need to maintain parity among the sentences of co-offenders. The court should also consider whether there are factors present which militate against enhancing an offender’s sentence, including medical grounds, old age, compassionate grounds, the importance of proportionality and the need to achieve consistency with Parliament’s intentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Where there are factors pulling in both directions, the court should judiciously exercise its discretion to strike the appropriate balance among the competing considerations, based on the facts of the particular case. Such a balance may also be struck by enhancing the offender’s sentence, but reducing the extent of the enhancement in light of the factors that militate against enhancement (see [91] below). We have not set out the relative weight of each factor. This would be neither possible nor ideal. The appropriate weight to be accorded to each factor is ultimately a fact-dependent exercise, and is best left to be developed through case law over time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">The duration question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 We turn to the second broad issue which pertains to how the extent of the enhancement should be determined. In our judgment, if the court decides to enhance an offender’s sentence, the extent of such enhancement should bear some correlation to the number of strokes of the cane that the offender has been exempted from. However, we would not go so far as to adopt a pro-rated approach. Rather, we consider that indicative ranges of sentences would better allow sentencing judges to calibrate the extent of the enhancement to fit the circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We thus provide the following indicative guidelines:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 1 to 6 strokes avoided: up to 3 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 7 to 12 strokes avoided: 3 to 6 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 13 to 18 strokes avoided: 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) More than 19 strokes avoided: 9 to 12 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Beyond this, in calibrating the precise extent of the enhancement, the court should have regard to the factors we have already discussed at [59]–[86] above. The court should identify the grounds which prompted it to enhance the offender’s sentence in the first place, and consider what length of imprisonment would be appropriate to address those concerns. Additionally, the court should also consider whether any factor which weighed against the enhancement of the offender’s sentence might justify a shorter period of additional imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law applied to the present appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In the light of these principles, we turn to the present appeal. As set out above at [3], the Appellant was convicted of one charge of trafficking 13.23g of diamorphine and one charge of possession of 0.27g of diamorphine. For the trafficking charge, he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. For the possession charge, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, for a global sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The Appellant was later certified by a medical officer to be permanently unfit for caning and the Prosecution applied for the Appellant’s sentence to be enhanced under s 332(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Before the learned District Judge, the Prosecution suggested that two weeks’ imprisonment be imposed for each of the 15 strokes of the cane, for a total of 30 weeks’ additional imprisonment. The Appellant, on the other hand, asked that no additional imprisonment term be imposed as his original imprisonment term of 20 years was already very severe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The decision of the learned District Judge is reported as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Amin Bin Abdullah </span>[2016] SGDC 352 (“the GD”). In summary, the District Judge applied the principle in <span class="font-italic">Nguyen </span>that the court should consider imposing an additional term of imprisonment on offenders who are exempted from caning unless there are special circumstances that justify not doing so. Finding no special circumstances in the Appellant’s case, the District Judge decided to enhance the Appellant’s sentence. The duration of such enhancement was arrived at using the pro-rated approach. Thus, the District Judge sentenced the Appellant to 30 weeks’ additional imprisonment in lieu of 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As evident from the foregoing discussion, we did not approach the Appellant’s case in the same way. Our starting point was that the Appellant’s sentence should not be enhanced unless there were grounds for it. We found no such grounds on the facts of this case. While we agreed with the general proposition that there was a need to deter drug offenders, we failed to see how deterrence was relevant to the Appellant. The Appellant’s exemption from caning was on medical grounds. For the reasons stated at [66]–[67] above, we considered that there was no real need to enhance the sentence in the interests of deterrence. Additionally, given the long minimum sentence that was applicable, there was likely to be less of a deterrent effect from any enhancement (see [68]–[69] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Nevertheless, we dismissed the Appellant’s appeal because we were satisfied that the Appellant’s original sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in 13.23g of diamorphine was in fact unduly low for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence for trafficking in 10–15g of diamorphine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The range of sentences for trafficking in 10–15g of diamorphine, as stated in the Second Schedule of the MDA, is between a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 115 (“<span class="font-italic">Suventher</span>”), the Court of Appeal at [29] applied the following sentencing approach in drug cases that had been laid down in <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 5 SLR 122:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the full spectrum of possible sentences should be utilised and the indicative starting points should be broadly proportional to the quantity of drugs trafficked or imported.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Court of Appeal also observed in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [31]) that “it is possible to use the proposed sentencing range set out above for offences involving other types of drugs where the range of prescribed punishment is the same.” In fact, the sentencing range (for cannabis) in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was recently applied by the Court of Appeal to a case of importing methamphetamine, where the range of prescribed punishment is the same, that is<span class="font-italic"> </span>between 20 and 30 years’ imprisonment: see <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGCA 39 at [55]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Applying the sentencing approach that was laid down in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span>, we determined that the following sentencing guidelines were appropriate in this case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 10 to 11.5g: 20 to 22 years’ imprisonment </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 11.6 to 13g: 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 13 to 14.99g: 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Thus, in the absence of mitigating factors, the Appellant should have received a sentence of between 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment for trafficking in 13.23g of diamorphine. It was not clear from the GD why the Appellant was originally sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane; it did not appear that any mitigating factor was applicable that would justify this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In this light, even after the enhancement, the Appellant’s overall sentence of 20 years and 30 weeks’ imprisonment cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. In fact, if we had allowed the Appellant’s appeal against the additional term of imprisonment imposed, we would also have exercised our powers of revision to increase the length of the Appellant’s original term of imprisonment as we found it to be manifestly inadequate: see ss 400(1) and 400(2), read with s 390(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC. In the final analysis, and in the absence of any appeal by the Prosecution against the primary sentence that was imposed below, we decided simply to dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against the enhancement of his sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For these reasons, we dismissed the Appellant’s appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Once again, we thank Mr Koh for his considerable assistance in the research and submissions he placed before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon     Chao Hick Tin         See Kee Oon<br/>Chief Justice      Judge of Appeal                            Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Appellant in person;<br/>Terence Chua, Chin Jincheng and Du Xuan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Zhen-Xi Benjamin (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) as young <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">micus curiae</span>.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
