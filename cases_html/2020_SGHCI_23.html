On the contrary, Nine Rivers submits that the 2014 SPA contains specific provisions under which Mr Patnaik is liable in the event of a breach. This includes clause 9 of the 2014 SPA, which expressly provides that he may be made to indemnify Nine Rivers against liabilities arising from a breach by Katra Finance and/or Mr Vangal under the 2014 SPA. Given that and his agreement under the terms of the 2014 SPA read with the SSSA to purchase Nine Rivers’ shares in GAPL in the event Nine Rivers chose to exercise its Investor Put Option right, Nine Rivers submits that Mr Patnaik cannot now claim that no relief should be given against him as he was not a Purchaser under the 2014 SPA.

Nine Rivers says that the Notice of Arbitration is devoid of merit and it refers to its Reply to the Notice of Arbitration dated 25 June 2019. First, Nine Rivers says that KHPL’s assertion that there is a dispute between Nine Rivers and KHPL because Nine Rivers issued the Put Option Notice against KHPL is incorrect, as the Put Option Notice did not require anything of KHPL. Secondly, KHPL also incorrectly states that certain relief was granted against KHPL in the Award. The Arbitrator did not make any substantive award against KHPL or find that KHPL should pay any of the costs of the Arbitration.

The Investor Put Option right has been granted to Nine Rivers under Clause 8.1 of the SPA and was incorporated into the SPA by means of reference. Since the Investor Put Option has been incorporated by means of reference instead of being reproduced verbatim, it is but natural for Nine Rivers to refer to Section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA to be able to exercise its rights under Clause 8.1 of the SPA. Hence, by mere reference to Section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA in the exercise of its rights under Clause 8.1 of the SPA cannot, by any logic or explanation, be construed to mean that the default on the part of the Respondents or the dispute or even the right to seek relief for the default has arisen under the SSSA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.12 Without prejudice to the above submissions, Nine Rivers submits that the Answering Respondents do not urge a case that there exists no arbitration agreement between the parties. The Answering Respondents clearly admit the existence of the arbitration clause contained in Clause 11.12 of the SPA. Further, the arbitration Clause 11.12 of the SPA, in no ambiguous terms, provides that “<span class="font-italic">In the event a dispute arises out of or in relation to or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement</span>” the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith consultation, failing which, the dispute was to be referred to this Hon'ble Tribunal. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Since, the cause of action resulting in the present dispute has arisen under the SPA, Nine Rivers submits that such dispute can only be arbitrated under Clause 11.12 of the SPA</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Arbitrator dealt with the issue of jurisdiction at paragraphs 87 to 93 of the Award which I set out in full:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87. I am satisfied that I do have jurisdiction to determine the claims in this arbitration. The ultimate dispute arises because Katra Finance has not purchased the Sale Securities in the manner in which it was required to under the 2014 SPA. One of the entitlements which Nine Rivers has in that event is to exercise its rights to put the Investor Securities under clause 17.2.2 of the SSSA. But the fact that the rights being exercised are rights which are originally contained within the SSSA does not mean that the dispute must inevitably be arbitrated under the terms of the SSSA Arbitration Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88. The Arbitration Agreement in the 2014 SPA is widely drawn. It covers a dispute which:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“.. <span class="font-italic">arises out of or in relation to or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement</span> ...”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The clause covers disputes which arise out of the 2014 SPA, and therefore not only disputes as to the operation, or meaning, or breach of the 2014 SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89. In my view there can be no doubt that this dispute arises out of the 2014 SPA. That agreement provided for the purchase of the Sale Securities by the Purchasers (as defined in that Agreement) pursuant to a deemed exercise of a Drag Along Right contained in the SSSA. Clause 8 of the 2014 SPA provided for what was to happen in the event that there was a failure to purchase the Sale Securities in accordance with the 2014 SPA, and it allowed Nine Rivers to exercise any other rights and remedies that it had, including any such remedies under the SSSA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90. That is in fact what happened, in that following the failure to purchase the Sale Securities in accordance with the 2014 SPA, Nine Rivers purported to exercise the rights that the 2014 SPA preserved, by the service of the Put Option Notice. But its entitlement to do so arose out of the failure by the Purchasers (as defined in the 2014 SPA, and as amended in the 2015 Amendment) to purchase the Sale Securities in accordance with the terms of the 2014 SPA. Therefore, it follows that the dispute in this case, including as to whether the Respondents have any obligations under the Put Option Notice, arise[s] out of the 2014 SPA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91. As a result, I am satisfied that I have jurisdiction to hear and determine this case. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">92. Nine Rivers contended that Section 17.2.2 of the SSSA was incorporated into the 2014 SPA by virtue of clause 8 of the 2014 SPA, and that this was why I had jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">93. I do not think that is correct. I do not think that the entitlements under the SSSA (and in particular Section 17.2.2) have been incorporated by reference. Clause 8 of the 2014 SPA simply preserved any entitlements to exercise the rights that existed under the SSSA, and that is different to incorporation. However, given the wide wording of the Arbitration Agreement in the 2014 SPA, it remains the case that despite the fact that Section 17.2.2 of the SSSA is not incorporated by reference, the current dispute is capable of being referred to arbitration under clause 11.12 of the 2014 SPA, because the dispute arose out of the implementation of the 2014 SPA, and the breach of that agreement, namely the failure to purchase the Sale Securities in accordance with its terms. Hence my jurisdiction is established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Mr Patnaik submits that the Arbitrator dismissed the basis on which Nine Rivers said that he had jurisdiction and founded the basis of his jurisdiction on the “widely drawn” arbitration clause which, in oral submissions, he said was not pleaded by Nine Rivers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In fact, as set out at [79] above, Nine Rivers, in the alternative, sought to rely on the terms of the arbitration agreement in clause 11.12 of the 2014 SPA in paragraph 2.11 of its Statement of Reply, so the basis for jurisdiction was properly pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 That arbitration agreement was, as the Arbitrator found, widely drawn. It provided that:

It is clear that the Arbitrator could determine whether Mr Vangal and Katra Finance had failed to meet their obligations under the 2014 SPA, as amended, and whether that amounted to a Default under clause 8.1 of the 2014 SPA. Equally, the Arbitrator could decide whether Nine Rivers was entitled, by the express terms of clause 8.1 of the 2014 SPA, to exercise rights and remedies under the SSSA and that those rights included the Investor Put Option under section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On that basis, it is evident that the issues of whether Nine Rivers had exercised its Investor Put Option Rights under section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA and was entitled to relief under that provision arose “out of or in relation to or in connection with the implementation of” the 2014 SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Mr Patnaik wrongly sought to limit the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to a claim for an indemnity under clause 9 of the 2014 SPA. The jurisdiction of the Arbitrator was much wider and included the grant of relief which was expressly referred to under clause 8.1 of the 2014 SPA and included relief against Mr Patnaik as a Promoter under the SSSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, which reflect the reasons of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator had jurisdiction to deal with the claim made by Nine Rivers as awarded in the Award.

However, the Arbitrator disallowed the other two submissions on the basis that those submissions were factual issues which could and should have been raised at the time of the Statement of Defence, and, if allowed at that stage of the proceedings, would cause prejudice to Nine Rivers because it was unable to adduce evidence to rebut the arguments, or alternatively it would cause an unnecessary adjournment to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) Despite the amendments having been disallowed, those respondents sought to make the same submissions in their closing arguments.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) The Arbitrator, however, held at paragraphs 149 to 152 of the Award that he would not permit them to make those submissions, given that the amendment application had been disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In terms of the relevant legal principles relating to natural justice, Nine Rivers submits that Mr Patnaik bears the burden of proving the factors summarised in <span class="font-italic">CEB v CEC and another</span><span class="font-italic"> matter</span> [2020] 4 SLR 183 (“<span class="font-italic">CEB v CEC</span>”) at [47] by Simon Thorley IJ, who said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span>”) at [29], the Court of Appeal, citing <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as John Holland Construction &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd) v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan)</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 443, identified the following four factors as having to be established by a party challenging an arbitral award on the basis of a breach of natural justice:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) which rule of natural justice was breached;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) how it was breached;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) how the breach prejudiced its rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Nine Rivers submits that Mr Patnaik has not established any of these factors. First, it says that it is unclear which rule of natural justice was allegedly breached and it refers to the following paragraphs from the High Court judgment by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Persero v CRW</span> ([43] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [41]–[42]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principles regarding the setting aside of an arbitral award on the basis of a breach of the rules of natural justice were extensively considered in <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86, and I shall not endeavor to repeat them here. An allegation of a breach of the rules of natural justice is serious and should not be taken lightly. Borrowing Justice Lax’s words in the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Corporacion</span><span class="font-italic"> Transnacional de Inversiones SA de CV v STET International SpA</span>, 1999 Carswell Ont 2988 at [33], to establish a breach of the rules of natural justice under Art 18 of the Model Law, “the conduct of the Tribunal must be sufficiently serious to offend our most basic notions of justice and morality”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">PGN was not very clear in its allegations on exactly which rule of natural justice was contravened. From its submission, PGN seemed to be attacking the Majority Award on the basis that the Majority Tribunal did not give it a proper hearing. However, as just mentioned, it was not clear whether this was indeed PGN’s submission. Such a vague allegation was tantamount to PGN taking a shot in the dark, and must be discouraged …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Nine Rivers submits that Mr Patnaik has not stated, in any of his affidavits, which is the rule of natural justice that was allegedly breached. He has merely described the parts of his amendment application that were submitted during the hearing and rejected by the Arbitrator. Mr Patnaik then relies on the fact that some parts of the amendment application were disallowed, to make the “vague allegation” that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice so that the Award should be set aside.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In any case, Mr Patnaik is unable to show any breach of the rules of natural justice. Nine Rivers submits that, first, the court has assess the “real nature of the complaint” and it refers to the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([100] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where Sundaresh Menon CJ cautioned as follows at [37]– [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A critical foundational principle in arbitration is that the parties choose their adjudicators. Central to this is the notion of party autonomy. Just as the parties enjoy many of the benefits of party autonomy, so too must they accept the consequences of the choices they have made. The courts do not and must not interfere in the merits of an arbitral award and, in the process, bail out parties who have made choices that they might come to regret, or offer them a second chance to canvass the merits of their respective cases. This important proscription is reflected in the policy of minimal curial intervention in arbitral proceedings, a mainstay of the Model Law and the IAA (see <span class="font-italic">BLC v BLB</span> [2014] 4 SLR 79 (“<span class="font-italic">BLC</span>”) at [51]–[53]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In particular, there is no right of appeal from arbitral awards. That is not to say that the courts can never intervene. However, the grounds for curial intervention are narrowly circumscribed, and generally concern process failures that are unfair and prejudice the parties or instances where the arbitral tribunal has made a decision that is beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement. It follows that, from the courts’ perspective, the parties to an arbitration do not have a right to a “correct” decision from the arbitral tribunal that can be vindicated by the courts. Instead, they only have a right to a decision that is within the ambit of their consent to have their dispute arbitrated, and that is arrived at following a fair process.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the light of their limited role in arbitral proceedings, the courts must resist the temptation to engage with what is substantially an appeal on the legal merits of an arbitral award, but which, through the ingenuity of counsel, may be disguised and presented as a challenge to process failures during the arbitration. A prime example of this would be a challenge based on an alleged breach of natural justice. When examining such a challenge, it is important that the court assesses the <span class="font-italic">real</span> nature of the complaint. Among the arguments commonly raised in support of breach of natural justice challenges are these:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) that the arbitral tribunal misunderstood the case presented and so did not apply its mind to the actual case of the aggrieved party;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that the arbitral tribunal did not mention the arguments raised by the aggrieved party and so must have failed to consider the latter’s actual case; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) that the arbitral tribunal must have overlooked a part of the aggrieved party’s case because it did not engage with the merits of that part of the latter’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although such arguments may be commonly raised, more often than not, they do not, in fact, amount to breaches of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the present proceedings, Nine Rivers submits that Mr Patnaik’s grievance is not with regards to whether the amendment application was heard or how the Arbitrator heard his submissions on that application. Instead, the real nature of his complaint is that the Arbitrator wrongly decided on his submissions in the amendment application, after hearing those submissions. Nine Rivers notes that Mr Patnaik does not deny that the Arbitrator heard his submissions on the amendment application and says that it was fully heard in spite of it being presented on the first day of the hearing and was partly allowed by the Arbitrator. Nine Rivers also points out that it is not alleged that there was some form of impropriety in the way that his submissions were heard by the Arbitrator. Mr Patnaik’s grievance is that the Arbitrator failed to agree with his submissions and allow the amendments and there is no evidence of a breach of the right to a fair hearing.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">150. This argument was the subject of the amendment application that was made on the first day of the hearing. For the reasons that I gave at that time (which essentially related to the point being raised too late, thereby creating a situation where necessary evidence would be lacking and Nine Rivers would have no opportunity to rebut the case with evidence), I rejected the application by the Answering Respondents to amend their defence to plead both that there was no satisfaction of the conditions precedent under clause 5 of the SPA, and that there was no certification of the representations and warranties as was required by clause 5.1.2 of the 2014 SPA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">151. Having had their application to amend rejected, the Answering Respondents have sought to resurrect the arguments in their final submissions by contending that Nine Rivers has a burden of proof to prove such compliance and has failed to satisfy that burden of proof. I note that the burden of proof point was expressly raised by the Answering Respondents in paragraphs B(ix) and C(iv) of their written application to amend.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">152. In the circumstances, I do not allow the Answering Respondents to raise and rely upon this point. They have already attempted to raise it and I have rejected their entitlement to do so as being too late. I will not therefore allow it to come back by way of an allegation of a burden of proof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In summary, Nine Rivers submits the Award should not be set aside for a breach of natural justice and it says that it is unclear which rule has been breached; the real nature of Mr Patnaik’s complaint does not constitute a breach of the rules of natural justice and the Arbitrator was entitled, under the SIAC Rules, to refuse the Amendment Application since he considered it to be inappropriate.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Discussion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In dealing with this application, I follow the guidance summarised in <span class="font-italic">CEB v CEC</span> ([109] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), derived from <span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span> ([104] supra) and <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as John Holland Construction &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd) v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan)</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 443. In an application under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, there are four factors that have to be established by a party challenging an arbitral award on the basis of a breach of natural justice:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) which rule of natural justice was breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) how it was breached;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) how the breach prejudiced its rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As submitted by Nine Rivers, the problem with Mr Patnaik’s contention that there has been a breach of the rules of natural justice is that he has found it difficult to articulate a case as to the rule of natural justice which is engaged in his application under s 24 of the IAA. In paragraphs 6(b) and 20 of Mr Patnaik’s First Affidavit and paragraph 41 of his Fourth Affidavit, the breach of the rules of natural justice was explained as being the fact that the Arbitrator had not allowed the application to amend the Statement of Defence. The most that was said was that the application was refused on the erroneous premise that the argument could and should have been raised at the time of defence, and that it would prejudice Nine Rivers if it was allowed to be raised as it would be unable to adduce the evidence necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 At the hearing, in oral submissions, the natural justice case was put on the basis that Mr Patnaik had been deprived of the right to a fair hearing. It was said that Mr Patnaik was denied a fair hearing because those key pleadings were not allowed to be brought into the proceedings via the amendment application. It was submitted that, if the pleadings had been allowed and Nine Rivers was not able to prove that the lack of issuance of the relevant notices did not affect the validity of the 2014 SPA, then it might have affected the outcome of the Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 However, this ground is essentially a challenge to the Arbitrator’s decision not to allow the amendment. It is not a challenge to the fairness of the hearing of the application to amend. Given the fact that Mr Patnaik raised these points in opening written submissions just before the hearing; the Arbitrator found that the points had not been pleaded; the Arbitrator allowed Mr Patnaik to make an application to amend and allowed one amendment but not the amendments raised in this ground, it is impossible to say that the Arbitrator did not give Mr Patnaik a fair hearing on the question of whether he should be allowed to amend his pleadings shortly before the hearing. The parties were allowed to ventilate their submissions on the amendments fully, both in writing and orally. In the circumstances, there was clearly no breach of the rules of natural justice in relation to the issue of whether Mr Patnaik was given a fair hearing on his late application to amend his pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The two amendments related to the issue of whether conditions precedent set out in clause 5.1 of the 2014 SPA had been satisfied and whether certification of representations, warranties and covenants in clause 7 of the 2014 SPA had taken place in terms of clause 5.1.2 of the 2014 SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In dealing with the application, the Arbitrator allowed one amendment but disallowed these two on the basis that the points should have been raised in the Statement of Defence but were being raised late and would cause prejudice to Nine Rivers if they were raised at that stage. That prejudice would either be because Nine Rivers was unable to adduce the evidence which was necessary in order to rebut such an argument, if there is evidence, or alternatively it would cause an unnecessary adjournment to those proceedings. At one stage there was a suggestion by Mr Patnaik on this application that the Arbitrator had misdirected himself because Nine Rivers could not have adduced evidence but that was withdrawn because it was incorrect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 On the basis of the facts in this case, the decision which the Arbitrator made was evidently a case management matter well within his discretion and cannot be challenged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Mr Patnaik’s submission, as developed in oral submissions, is that this decision not to allow the amendments meant that Nine Rivers did not have the burden of showing that the rights under the 2014 SPA were valid and enforceable. He says that this was an “important and essential issue” and the fact that he was deprived of the opportunity to rely on this issue meant that there was not a fair hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 That is not a question of a breach of natural justice. It is a failure by him to plead those issues at the correct time. The points were raised late and slipped into opening submissions for the hearing. This led to Mr Patnaik having to make an application to amend which the Arbitrator disallowed. That decision cannot be challenged on natural justice grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 It follows that the application under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA fails.                       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application under Article 34(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">b</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)(ii) of the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in Article 6 only if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the court finds that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the award is in conflict with the public policy of this State.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Patnaik’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Patnaik in the Arbitration that the terms of the 2014 SPA requiring the purchase of the Sale Securities for consideration amounted to an assured return which was inconsistent with the Indian Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations (“FEMA Regulations”), as amended in 2013 (“the FEMA Regulations 2013”). He therefore contended that the amendments to the FEMA Regulations in 2013 rendered section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA void after the SSSA was entered into in 2010, and that the 2014 SPA and section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA were therefore void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span>. It was also contended that, if a contract was illegal, it was void under s 23 of the Contract Act 1872 (Act No 9 of 1872) (India). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Arbitrator heard submissions from Indian counsel for the parties on those contentions and determined as follows in the Award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On Indian Contract Law, at paragraph 113:

It is not something that makes the 2014 SPA, the 2015 Amendment or section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA void ab initio. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Mr Patnaik submits that, based on Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit, the Arbitrator erred in making these findings. Mr Patnaik submits that, on that basis, the Award is contrary to Singapore public policy and so should be set aside under Article 32(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. He submits that Singapore public policy has been breached because, as a matter of Singapore public policy, international comity will not allow a Singapore court to affirm an award the performance of which would be in breach or illegal pursuant to the laws of another friendly country.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Mr Patnaik refers to a number of authorities. First, he refers to <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span> [2010] 4 SLR 649 (“<span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span>”) which was relied on by Nine Rivers. He says that the concluding agreement in that case was not illegal at the time it was entered into (“Concluding Agreement”; see [145] below). The arbitral tribunal found that the Concluding Agreement was not illegal because it made a finding of fact that the Concluding Agreement did not require the appellant to do anything other than to receive evidence of the withdrawal and discontinuance of the criminal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The case came before the court on an application under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law and one of the issues was the extent to which the Singapore courts could open up the findings which had been made by the arbitral tribunal. The Court of Appeal decided that it could not open up a finding of fact which was a finding as to the effect of certain acts upon the Concluding Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Mr Patnaik submits that this case is distinguishable on the basis that, in the present case, it is not an agreement which forms the illegality but the construction of a foreign statute which is an issue of law, not an issue of a finding of fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 He submits that it was a finding of law which caused the illegality by way of statute and this breaches Indian public policy. On that basis, he accepts that as stated in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">JT v AJU</span> at [65]: “[t]his means that findings of fact made in an IAA award are binding on the parties and cannot be reopened except where there is fraud, breach of natural justice or some other recognised vitiating factor”. However, he submits that the decision that the learned Arbitrator made was a finding of law which is not binding on the parties and as such can be challenged on the basis that it is in breach of public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 He also refers to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> ([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where the arbitrator issued a fourth interim award holding that any award of damages in favour of Kempinski for the intermediary period would be against the public policy of Indonesia and therefore unenforceable. He says that the Court of Appeal affirmed the arbitrator’s decision and held that the arbitrator was correct in holding that he had no power to award any damages to Kempinski as doing so would have been contrary to the public policy of Indonesia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 He submits that that case is similar to the present case in that, in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>, the parties entered into a management contract of a hotel in 1994 but, between 1996 and 2000, three decisions were issued by the Indonesian tourism industry making it illegal for a foreign entity to manage hotels in Indonesia, unless it sets up a company incorporated in Indonesia or enter into a joint venture with an Indonesian party. Kempinski was advised that it would not be acting in contravention of the new regulatory framework and therefore continued to manage the hotel without any objections from Prima. The business relationship between the parties ended and a notice of termination was issued by Prima to Kempinski. Kempinski then commenced arbitration alleging that the termination was wrongful and sought damages or specific performance. Prima then pleaded illegality in view of the requirements of the Indonesian tourism industry. The arbitrator issued four interim awards and in the fourth award held that any award of damages in favour of Kempinski would be against Indonesian public policy and unenforceable, and therefore Kempinski’s claim for relief failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In the High Court, it was held that, as the third award had been set aside, then the fourth award should be set aside. The Court of Appeal held at [72] that the fact that public policy had not been pleaded did not affect the position and stated: “In our view, public policy is a question of law which an arbitrator must take cognisance of if he becomes aware of it in the course of hearing the evidence presented during arbitral proceedings”. Mr Patnaik submits that public policy is a point of law and that this supports his case. In <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>, the contract became illegal after it was signed, and the Court of Appeal affirmed the arbitrator’s decision to hold that he had no power to make an award which was contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Mr Patnaik then refers to <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 842 (“<span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span>”) at [45] where the Court of Appeal summarised the position, based on <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> [1929] 1 KB 470 (“<span class="font-italic">Foster v </span><span class="font-italic">Driscoll</span>”), as such: “In other words, an agreement whose object to be attained is a breach of international comity will be regarded by the courts as being against public policy and void”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Mr Patnaik therefore says that there is authority in Singapore following on from <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> that an agreement whose object to be attained is a breach of international comity will be regarded by the courts as being against public policy and void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Finally, Mr Patnaik refers to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>”), where the court was asked to determine if the guarantees given by the appellant should not be enforced on the principle of international comity, because the giving of loans were contrary to Hong Kong laws. The court held that the giving of loans was not contrary to Hong Kong laws, but again restated the principle of international comity as established in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Mr Patnaik therefore submits that Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit on Indian law is highly relevant as it shows that, under the 2014 SPA, he would have been in breach of the FEMA Regulations and Indian law and in breach of Indian public policy. He submits that it would consequently be against Singapore public policy to affirm the Award based on a contract which endeavours to perform an illegal act in India.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nine Rivers’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Nine Rivers submits that the issue is whether, in the present proceedings, the Award should be set aside on public policy grounds on the basis that it contravenes the foreign exchange laws in India and, consequently, is in conflict with the public policy of India. It submits that the Award cannot be set aside on the basis that it is in conflict with the public policy of India as the relevant public policy is that of Singapore. It contends that evidence relating to the public policy of any country other than Singapore is irrelevant for determining whether the Award should be set aside on the public policy grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Nine Rivers refers to Mr Patnaik’s assertion that the Singapore courts have previously considered the public policy of another sovereign nation and set aside an arbitral award on the basis that it was against the public policy of that sovereign nation, and that the Singapore courts will treat any agreement whose object is a breach of international comity as being against public policy and void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Nine Rivers refers to the decisions of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> [2011] 4 SLR 739 (“<span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span>”). In that case, AJT instituted arbitration proceedings against AJU, in relation to an agreement between P (a related company of AJT) and AJU. After commencement of the arbitration, AJU made a complaint of fraud, forgery, and the use of a forged document to the Thai police against O (AJT’s sole director and shareholder), P, and Q (another related company of AJT). While the police investigations were ongoing, AJU and AJT entered the Concluding Agreement. In the Concluding Agreement, AJU agreed that it would withdraw the complaint; obtain evidence of termination of all criminal proceedings against O, P, and Q; and pay a sum to AJT. In exchange, AJT agreed that all existing claims between them were deemed as fully settled. The Concluding Agreement was governed by Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 After AJU withdrew the complaint and paid the sum to AJT, the Thai prosecution confirmed that a non-prosecution order was issued in respect of the charges against O, P, and Q. However, AJT claimed that AJU failed to comply with the Concluding Agreement and hence AJT refused to terminate the arbitration. AJU applied to the tribunal to terminate the arbitration, on the ground that the parties had reached full and final settlement of the claim in view of the Concluding Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 AJT challenged the validity of the Concluding Agreement on the grounds of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, illegality, on the basis that the Concluding Agreement required AJT to take unlawful action to stop the criminal proceedings in Thailand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The tribunal decided that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Concluding Agreement was not illegal. AJT then applied to set aside the tribunal’s award on the grounds that, among other things, the award sought to enforce the Concluding Agreement which was illegal and unenforceable in Thailand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The High Court stated, at [34] and [36] of <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span> ([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), that “the courts will treat a contract governed by its own law as void where the parties’ intention and object contemplated thereby jeopardises relations between its government and another friendly government”, and hence, “an agreement whose object to be attained is a breach of international comity will be regarded by the courts as being against public policy and void”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The High Court stated at [40] that “if the Concluding Agreement was entered into by the parties in furtherance of an illegal purpose under the law of the place of performance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Thai law, it will have to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to the public policy of Singapore under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Nine Rivers submits that the salient distinctions between <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span> and the present case are that, first, the Concluding Agreement was governed by Singapore law. It was in this context that the High Court held at [34] that “the courts will treat a contract governed by its own law as void where the parties’ intention and object contemplated thereby jeopardises relations between its government and another friendly government”. In other words, this does not mean that the court will consider the public policy of another nation, where the underlying contract is governed by a foreign law.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Nine Rivers refers to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> ([145] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where, at [62], it clarified that the true question that was being considered was “whether, if a Singapore court disagrees with the Tribunal’s finding that the Concluding Agreement is not illegal under Singapore law, the court’s supervisory power extends to correcting the Tribunal’s decision on this issue of illegality”. Hence, Nine Rivers submits that, where an underlying contract is governed by a foreign law such as in the present case where the 2014 SPA is governed by Indian law, there is nothing to suggest that the Singapore courts, in determining whether to set aside the Award on public policy grounds, will consider whether the contract is illegal under the foreign law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Secondly, Nine Rivers refers to the fact that the present proceedings involve setting aside the Award and not enforcing the Award, which is a matter being currently dealt with in the High Court of Delhi, India. The principles in <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span> ([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) were derived from cases where the courts were being asked to enforce contracts that were governed by the court’s domestic law and to be performed in another foreign nation. It submits that they do not automatically extend to situations where the court is being asked to set aside an international arbitration award arising from an underlying contract that was governed by a foreign law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In this case, Nine Rivers submits that the Arbitrator also made clear, at paragraph 133 of the Award, that “the question of whether [Mr Patnaik] is ultimately entitled, under FEMA and its regulations, to effect the transfer to which he has agreed under the SSSA, is more properly to be determined if and when enforcement of any award I may give is to be addressed”. As enforcement proceedings have already been commenced in India and Mauritius, Nine Rivers submits that the appropriate forum to determine the Indian law issues is in the enforcement proceedings rather than this application to set aside the Award.

In this regard, Mr Patnaik has not shown why, at the time of the Arbitration, Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit was not available and/or could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence.

This important proscription is reflected in the policy of minimal curial intervention in arbitral proceedings, a mainstay of the Model Law and the IAA …” [emphasis in original removed].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Further, Nine Rivers submits that, even if the Arbitrator had made an error of fact or error of law in respect of his decision on the Indian law issues, that, in itself, would not permit the Award to be set aside on public policy grounds. It says that the high threshold for establishing public policy grounds was recently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BBA v BAZ</span>, in these terms at [101]–[102]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lastly, the CA 10 Appellants argued that an egregious error of law in the making of an Award amounts to a breach of public policy and the finding of joint and several liability is such an error. To demonstrate the severity of such an error, Mr Sreenivasan argued there could be wider consequences for shareholder agreements with “drag-along” clauses and collective sale agreements. BAZ disagreed that public policy was engaged.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is settled jurisprudence that mere errors of law do not cross the high threshold of making out a breach of Singapore’s public policy: <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi</span>”) at [57]; <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> [2011] 4 SLR 739 at [62]. The CA 10 Appellants’ arguments were redolent of an attempt to recast an “egregious” error of law as a matter of public policy.

The Indian law issues had already been submitted on and determined in the Award and any attempt to revive them at this stage is a clear abuse of process. Even if there was an error of fact or law in respect of the Arbitrator’s decision on the Indian law issues, this is insufficient to set aside the Award on public policy grounds.

First, the extent to which the findings of fact and/or law of the Arbitrator should be taken to be final and binding on this court and whether the correctness of those findings can be challenged on the basis of evidence submitted for the purpose of the Application. Secondly, to the extent that the findings of fact and/or law are not final and binding and it were to be found that the Award was illegal in India, would this court set aside the Award on the grounds that it conflicted with the public policy of Singapore?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The effect of findings by the Arbitrator</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In summary, Mr Patnaik submits that, based on Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit, the Award is in conflict with the laws of India and consequently in conflict with the public policy of India as it is not enforceable against Mr Patnaik, who is an Indian resident. He submits that the court should therefore make its own finding on this question of law, even if it amounts to re-litigating an issue considered in the Arbitration and dealt with in the Award.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Nine Rivers, in summary, submits that Mr Patnaik cannot rely on Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit because the issue of whether the 2014 SPA was an illegal agreement was an issue in the arbitration proceedings and cannot be re-litigated on the merits in an application to set aside the Award on the basis of Singapore public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">AJT v AJU</span> ([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> ([145] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), there was an SIAC arbitration based on the Concluding Agreement governed by Singapore law. It was alleged that the Concluding Agreement was null and void on the grounds of duress, undue influence and illegality. The arbitral tribunal decided that the Concluding Agreement was valid and enforceable. The other party then applied to the High Court to set aside the award under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law on the basis that the award was contrary to Singapore public policy as it was an agreement to take steps to stifle a prosecution in Thailand and therefore illegal under Singapore law (the governing law) and Thai law (the place of performance). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The High Court judge reopened the findings of the arbitral tribunal and set aside the award, holding that the Concluding Agreement was an agreement to stifle the prosecution in Thailand and was contrary to public policy in Singapore. On appeal, the Court of Appeal dealt with two issues, the first being: whether the Judge was correct in going behind the award and reopening the tribunal’s finding that the Concluding Agreement was valid and enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The Court of Appeal held that the Judge was not entitled to reject and substitute the tribunal’s findings with his own findings. The Court of Appeal said that arbitration under the IAA was international arbitration and not domestic arbitration, and so s 19B(1) provided that an IAA award was final and binding on the parties, subject only to narrow grounds for curial intervention. This meant that findings of fact made in an IAA award were binding on the parties and could not be reopened except where there was fraud, breach of natural justice or some other recognised vitiating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The Court of Appeal referred to <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa </span>([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [53]–[57], where it was held that, even if an arbitral tribunal’s findings of law and/or fact were wrong, such errors would not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> engage the public policy of Singapore. In that case, the public policy of Singapore was not engaged by the findings of fact of the tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In giving its judgment in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> ([145] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal made some important observations on the approach of a court faced with an application to set aside a contract on grounds of illegality. First, at [37], the court said that there was no difference between the enforcement regime in s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and the setting aside regime under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law as far as public policy is concerned, so that case law on the enforcement regime is relevant to the setting aside regime. As stated in [38], where enforcement was resisted on public policy grounds, the public policy objection must involve either “exceptional circumstances…which would justify the court in refusing to enforce the award” or a violation of “the most basic notions of morality and justice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Secondly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> considered the issue of whether a court could reopen an arbitral tribunal’s finding on the legality of the underlying contract and decide that issue for itself, as the High Court judge had done in that case. In coming to a conclusion on this aspect, the Court of Appeal considered two English authorities: first,  the decision of Colman J and the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Inc v Jugoimport-SPDR Holding Co Ltd</span> [1999] QB 740 (“<span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”) and [2000] 1 QB 288 (“<span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) and, second, the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span><span class="font-italic"> v Soleimany</span> [1999] QB 785 (“<span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span>”). After analysing those authorities, the Court of Appeal at [59]–[61] analysed two divergent approaches to the circumstances in which the court may reopen an arbitral tribunal’s decision that an underlying contract was legal. They considered that the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> by Colman J and by the majority of the English Court of Appeal was to be preferred to the more liberal and “interventionist” approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span> and by Waller LJ in the minority in the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. The Court of Appeal at [60] said that the preferred approach was “consonant with the legislative policy of the IAA of giving primacy to the autonomy of arbitral proceedings and upholding the finality of arbitral awards (whether foreign arbitral awards or IAA awards).”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The approach taken by Colman J in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, in the context of <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> and this case, was summarised in two principles at 767G–768A, cited in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> at [42]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) If the court concluded that the arbitration agreement conferred jurisdiction to determine whether the underlying contract was illegal and by the award the arbitrators determined that it was not illegal, prima facie the court would enforce the resulting award. (vi) If the party against whom the award was made then sought to challenge enforcement of the award on the grounds that, <span class="font-italic">on the basis of facts not placed before the arbitrators</span>, the contract was indeed illegal, the enforcement court would have to consider whether the public policy against the enforcement of illegal contracts outweighed the countervailing public policy in support of the finality of awards in general and of awards in respect of the same issue in particular. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 On balance, Colman J held in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at 773A–E that “the public policy of sustaining international arbitration awards on the facts of this case outweighs the public policy in discouraging international commercial corruption”. At 769A, Colman J had observed that, since the parties had selected arbitration by an impressively competent international body (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the International Chamber of Commerce), the English courts would be entitled to assume that the arbitrators appointed were of undoubted competence and ability, and well able to understand and determine the particular issue of illegality arising in that case. In <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> at [61], the Court of Appeal said that this premise applied <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> in that case, given that: “(a) the parties selected arbitration by the SIAC (an equally competent international body); (b) the Tribunal consisted of experienced members of the local Bar; and (c) the Tribunal decided the issue of illegality according to Singapore law. For these reasons, a Singapore court would all the more be entitled to assume that the members of the Tribunal had adequate knowledge of Singapore law.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> ([145] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the law to be applied in the arbitration was Singapore law and the Court of Appeal at [62] held that the judge was entitled to decide whether the Concluding Agreement was illegal and to set aside the award if it was tainted with illegality. It stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Be that as it may, since the law applied by the Tribunal was Singapore law, the question that arises is whether, if a Singapore court disagrees with the Tribunal’s finding that the Concluding Agreement is not illegal under Singapore law, the court’s supervisory power extends to correcting the Tribunal’s decision on this issue of illegality. In our view, the answer to this question must be in the affirmative as the court cannot abrogate its judicial power to the Tribunal to decide what the public policy of Singapore is and, in turn, whether or not the Concluding Agreement is illegal (illegality and public policy being, as pointed out at [19] above, mirror concepts in this regard), however eminent the Tribunal’s members may be. Accordingly, we agree with the Judge that the court is entitled to decide for itself whether the Concluding Agreement is illegal and to set aside the Interim Award if it is tainted with illegality, just as in <span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span>, the English CA refused to enforce the Beth Din’s award as it was tainted with illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 However, at [64], the Court of Appeal concluded that it was not an appropriate case for the judge to reopen the tribunal’s finding that the Concluding Agreement was valid and enforceable. They found that the case was not a <span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span>-type case ([173] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) involving an underlying contract tainted by illegality where the tribunal had ignored palpable and indisputable illegality, but a case more analogous to <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> ([173] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) or <span class="font-italic">Omnium de </span><span class="font-italic">Traitement et de Valorisation SA v Hilmarton Ltd</span> [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 222, where the respective arbitral tribunals found that the underlying contracts in question did not involve the giving of bribes but lobbying of government officials, which was not contrary to English public policy.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> held at [65] that the judge was not entitled to reject the tribunal’s findings and substitute his own findings for them. It referred to s 19B(1) of the IAA which provides that: “[a]n award made by the arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and binding on the parties and on any persons claiming through or under them and may be relied upon by any of the parties by way of defence, set-off or otherwise in any proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.” The Court of Appeal stated that this meant that “findings of fact made in an IAA award are binding on the parties and cannot be reopened except where there is fraud, breach of natural justice or some other recognised vitiating factor.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The Court of Appeal then referred to <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa</span> ([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and said at [66]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this connection, we would reiterate the point which this court made in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa</span> ([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [53]–[57], <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that even if an arbitral tribunal’s findings of law and/or fact are wrong, such errors would not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> engage the public policy of Singapore. In particular, we would draw attention to the following passage from [57] of that judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he [IAA] … gives primacy to the autonomy of arbitral proceedings and limits court intervention to only the prescribed situations. The legislative policy under the [IAA] is to minimise curial intervention in international arbitrations. Errors of law or fact made in an arbitral decision, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, are final and binding on the parties and may not be appealed against or set aside by a court except in the situations prescribed under s 24 of the [IAA] and Art 34 of the Model Law. While we accept that an arbitral award is final and binding on the parties under s 19B of the [IAA], we are of the view that <span class="font-italic">the [IAA] will be internally inconsistent if the public policy provision in Art 34 of the Model Law is construed to enlarge the scope of curial intervention to set aside errors of law or fact. For consistency, such errors may be set aside only if they are outside the scope of the submission to arbitration. In the present context, errors of law or fact, </span>per se<span class="font-italic">, do not engage the public policy of Singapore under Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law when they cannot be set aside under Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This passage recognises the reality that where an arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction to decide any issue of fact and/or law, it may decide the issue correctly or incorrectly. Unless its decision or decision-making process is tainted by fraud, breach of natural justice or any other vitiating factor, any errors made by an arbitral tribunal are not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 However, the Court of Appeal said that, as an award could be challenged on public policy grounds, it was necessary to clarify the application of the principle that “errors of law or fact, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, do not engage the public policy of Singapore”. At [67]–[68] they said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… since s 19B(4) of the IAA, read with Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law, expressly provides that an arbitral award can be challenged on public policy grounds, it is necessary for us to clarify the application of the general principle laid down in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa</span> (at [57]) that “errors of law or fact, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, do not engage the public policy of Singapore”. It is a question of law what the public policy of Singapore is. An arbitral award can be set aside if the arbitral tribunal makes an error of <span class="font-italic">law</span> in this regard, as expressly provided by s 19B(4) of the IAA, read with Art 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law.

</div> The Arbitrator rejected the submission in respect of the 2015 Amendment for the same reasons as in relation to the 2014 SPA. As Mr Patnaik is a resident of India, the Arbitrator held that the FEMA Regulations (as amended by the FEMA Regulations 2013) would apply to any transfer of the Investor Securities to him. As a result, he went on to analyse whether the SSSA might contravene the FEMA Regulations (as amended by the FEMA Regulations 2013), and consequently whether it might be void.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The Arbitrator held at paragraph 132 of the Award that, contrary to Mr Patnaik’s case, on a proper construction of both the 2014 SPA and the SSSA, the Investor Put Option was not an optionality clause with an assured return but it was contingent, entirely at the behest of the Purchaser, the Company and the Promoters, and no return was assured at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 At paragraph 133, the Arbitrator also added that he accepted that “the RBI can be asked for permission in respect of the Investor Put Option, and that thus the question of whether Mr Patnaik is ultimately entitled, under FEMA and its regulations, to effect the transfer to which he has agreed under the SSSA, is more properly to be determined if and when enforcement of any award I may give is to be addressed. It is not something that makes the 2014 SPA, the 2015 Amendment or section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA void ab initio”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The foregoing findings of the Arbitrator involved findings of fact as to the nature of the transactions under the 2014 SPA, the 2015 Amendment and the SSSA. For the reasons set out in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> ([145] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), those findings of fact made by the Arbitrator are final and binding and in this case there is no vitiating factor such as fraud or breach of natural justice which allows them to be reopened in this court.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Further, even if the Arbitrator made findings of law, those would be findings of Indian law which he made after hearing submissions from Indian lawyers. The relevant agreements in this case, unlike the Concluding Agreement in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span>, were governed by Indian law and not by Singapore law. So far as this Singapore court is concerned, findings of Indian law are findings of <span class="font-italic">fact</span> as to a foreign law. For this court, considering an application under the IAA, an issue of foreign law is a matter of fact which has to be proved by evidence. Therefore, the findings of the Arbitrator as to Indian law were findings of fact so far as this court is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 On that basis and as explained in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span>, Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law does not apply to errors of fact, and limiting the application of the public policy objection in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law to findings of Singapore law made by an arbitral tribunal is consistent with the legislative objective of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The relevant issue of law in this case is the public policy of Singapore. As the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> at [67] shows (see [180] above), if an arbitral tribunal decides that a contract is illegal but also decides that it was not against Singapore public policy to enforce that contract in Singapore, that finding would be a finding of law which, if it were erroneous, could be set aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law by a court in Singapore if the contract is governed by Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 However, if an arbitral tribunal decides that a contract is not illegal under a foreign law, as is the case here under Indian law, then there is no issue of Singapore law which is engaged and therefore no finding of law which a Singapore court could set aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 If, contrary to my finding, the decision of the Arbitrator on the meaning of the FEMA Regulations under Indian law was a matter which amounted to a finding of law which was open to challenge in this court, it is clear that the parties selected arbitration by the SIAC (a competent international body) and the Arbitrator is an experienced arbitrator. Further, the Arbitrator decided the issue of Indian law based on the procedure which the parties agreed and Mr Patnaik now seeks to challenge the findings of the Arbitrator by adducing fresh evidence, not produced in the Arbitration. Using the phrase of Colman J in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> ([173] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), even if it were open for me to consider the issue of Indian law afresh on an application under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law, I would not, on balance, do so. In my judgment, the public policy of sustaining international awards on the facts of the current case outweighs the public policy in discouraging international commercial transactions which breach a country’s foreign exchange regulations, even if, contrary to the findings of the Arbitrator, that is what happened in this case.                  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indian public policy and Singapore public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 In the light of my decision, this issue does not arise. However, having heard full argument, I consider it appropriate to deal with it.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 The parties agree that the relevant public policy to consider under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law is that of <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span>, not India.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Mr  Patnaik submits that the Award is in breach of the public policy of India, as it affirmed a contract which necessitated parties joining in an endeavour to perform an act which was illegal by the laws of India in terms of acting contrary to the FEMA Regulations. Consequently, he says that the Award is in breach of Singapore public policy and should be set aside. I shall assume that, contrary to what I have said above, I had held that the SSSA and the 2014 SPA, as amended, were illegal contracts under the laws of India. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 As outlined above, Mr Patnaik principally relies on three authorities: <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span> ([139] supra), and <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([141] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The facts and holding of <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> have been outlined at [136]–[138] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span>, a German bank in Singapore extended foreign currency credit facilities to a Malaysian resident under a facility agreement governed by Singapore law. The bank commenced proceedings against the individual who contended that the proper law was Malaysian law and the facility agreement was illegal and void as it breached Exchange Control and Moneylenders statutes in Malaysia. The Court of Appeal held at [45] and [48] that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> ([139] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) did not apply on the facts of that case as the obligation sought to be enforced did not involve the doing of an act in Malaysia but in Singapore, and the parties had not intended or contemplated breaking the laws of Malaysia at the time of contracting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The Court of Appeal also stated at [54], without further consideration of the exact scope of <span class="font-italic">Ralli</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros v Compania Naviera Sota y Aznar</span> [1920] 2 KB 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Ralli</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span>”), that there should not be an unequivocal merger between the principle in <span class="font-italic">Ralli</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span> – that a contract was invalid in so far as the performance of it was unlawful by the law of the country where it was to be performed – and that in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span>, where a contract whose object was a breach of international comity would be void for being against public policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 In considering <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span>, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span> stated at [45]–[47]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appellant also raised a related argument based on a principle of public policy formulated in the case of <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> ([19] supra). This principle states that the courts will treat a contract governed by its own law as void where the parties’ intention and object contemplated thereby jeopardises relations between its government and another friendly government. The case concerned a contract, governed by English law, for the supply and sale of whisky that was to be smuggled into the United States of America in contravention of the prohibition laws in force at the time. The actions were brought in relation to various disputes arising out of the contract. The Court of Appeal categorically stated that the courts would not enforce such a contract “made between the parties to further an adventure or break the laws of a foreign state”. Sankey LJ added:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… an English contract should and will be held invalid on account of illegality if the real object and intention of the parties necessitates them joining in an endeavour to perform in a foreign and friendly country some act which is illegal by the law of such country notwithstanding the fact that there may be, in certain events, alternative modes or places of performing which permit the contract to be performed legally. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In other words, an agreement whose object to be attained is a breach of international comity will be regarded by the courts as being against public policy and void.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This principle was elaborated on in the case of <span class="font-italic">Regazzoni</span><span class="font-italic"> v K C Sethia (1944) Ltd</span> ([19] supra) which concerned a contract for the sale and delivery of jute bags. The parties to the contract contemplated that these bags should be shipped from India to Genoa for resale to South Africa. One party eventually repudiated the contract and the other party brought an action for damages for breach of contract. The proper law of the contract was English law. At the time, there was in force a prohibition on the export of goods to South Africa by the Indian Government. The Law Lords agreed with and applied <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span>. Lord Keith said ([19] supra) at 327:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… to recognise the contract between the appellant and the respondent as an enforceable contract would give a just cause for complaint by the Government of India and should be regarded as contrary to conceptions of international comity. On grounds of public policy, therefore, this is a contract which our courts ought not to recognize.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the same case, Lord Reid added at 323 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The real question is one of public policy in English law: but in considering this question we must have in mind the background of international law and international relationships often referred to as the comity of nations. This is not a case of a contract being made in good faith but one party thereafter finding that he cannot perform his part of the contract without committing a breach of foreign law in the territory of the foreign country. If this contract is held to be unenforceable, it should, in my opinion, be because from the beginning the contract was tainted so that the courts of this country will not assist either party to enforce it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Based on this and the finding that the parties had intended to violate the laws of India, the House of Lords held that the contract was unenforceable since an English court would not enforce a contract or award damages for its breach, if its performance would involve doing an act in a foreign and friendly state which would violate the law of that state. This was based on the principle of public policy and the consequent desire for international comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span> ([141] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [124], the Court of Appeal also referred to the principle in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> and said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The Appellant’s pleaded case was based on the principle of international comity established in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> … Sankey LJ explained the principle in the following terms (at 521–522):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]n English contract should and will be held invalid on account of illegality <span class="font-italic">if the real object and intention of the parties necessitates them joining in an endeavour to perform in a foreign and friendly country some act which is illegal by the law of such country</span> notwithstanding the fact that there may be, in a certain event, alternative modes or places of performing which permit the contract to be performed legally. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This principle was accepted by us in <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee …</span> at [45].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201  It is evident that, on grounds of international comity, a court will not as a matter of public policy enforce a contract if the real object and intention of the parties necessitates them joining in an endeavour to perform in a foreign and friendly country an act which is illegal in that country. However, that is not what the court is dealing with here. As Colman J pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Westacre</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> ([173] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at 772–773:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… an order of this court which <span class="font-italic">directly</span> enforced such an agreement would be in collision with the public policy of Kuwait. That, however, is not the order which the plaintiffs invite this court to make, for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is the additional dimension in this case that the issue of illegality has already been the subject of arbitration and of a valid award</span>. Although direct enforcement of the contract would clearly be offensive to comity, enforcement of any such award in England under the New York Convention must be very much less so, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for enforcement does not substantially depend on the public policy of Kuwait but of this country</span>. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The important starting point is that, of the foregoing three cases highlighted by Mr Patnaik, <span class="font-italic">only Kempinski</span> ([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) dealt with the setting aside of an arbitral award.  In <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee</span> ([139] supra) and <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>, a national court was considering the question of the <span class="font-italic">enforcement of </span><span class="font-italic">a contract governed by its national law </span>in litigation proceedings before the court. In such a case, if the real object and intention of the parties necessitates them joining in an endeavour to perform in a foreign and friendly country some act which is illegal by the law of such country, then the national court may refuse enforcement on the basis of public policy, as it would be a breach of international comity to do so. That does not mean that every illegal contract would always, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>public policy, not be enforced or would be set aside on the basis that a contract was illegal in the place of performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 In the present case, even if I had found that the SSSA and the 2014 SPA, as amended, were illegal under the laws of India, the grounds for a breach of international comity of the type set out in <span class="font-italic">Foster v Driscoll</span> ([139] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) would not have been made out. <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> does not assist Mr Patnaik’s case because the Court of Appeal in that case was <span class="font-italic">not </span>considering the issue of public policy under <span class="font-italic">Art 34(2)(</span><span class="font-italic">b)(ii)</span> of the Model Law and whether it would indeed be in breach of <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>public policy to enforce a contract that is illegal in a foreign state due to a breach of international comity. Rather, it was considering if an arbitral tribunal’s consideration of an <span class="font-italic">unpleaded</span> public policy point would cause the tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction and thus give rise to a breach of <span class="font-italic">Art 34(2)(</span><span class="font-italic">a)(iii) </span>of the Model Law. Mr Patnaik has thus not cited any authority for the proposition that a contract which is illegal in another foreign state <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> leads to a breach of international comity, and thus <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> public policy under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law, if the arbitral award contemplating the enforcement of that contract is not set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The authorities demonstrate that the public policy ground under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law is a <span class="font-italic">narrow</span> ground, and the test is whether the upholding of the arbitral award would “shock the conscience”; is “clearly injurious to the public good or ... wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public”; or “where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice”: <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa </span>([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [59]. To succeed on a public policy argument, the party has to cross a “very high threshold” and demonstrate “egregious circumstances such as corruption, bribery or fraud, which would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice”: <span class="font-italic">Sui Southern Gas Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power </span><span class="font-italic">Co (Pte) Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1 at [48]; <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other matters</span> [2018] SGHC 275 at [156]–[159]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The relevant question is whether the illegality in the foreign state would demonstrate sufficiently egregious circumstances that would “shock the conscience” or violate the most basic notions of morality and justice so as to amount to a breach of Singapore public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 In the present case, there is no reason why a breach of the FEMA Regulations or the laws of India, without more, would “shock the conscience” or violate the “most basic notions of morality and justice”. If Mr Patnaik’s submissions are taken to their logical conclusion, then <span class="font-italic">any</span> minor illegality or regulatory infringement by a contract in its place of performance would <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> lead to the conclusion that international comity, and thus Singapore public policy, would be breached so that the arbitral award would have to be set aside. The public policy ground under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law is a narrow ground and does not lead to that conclusion. I therefore reject Mr Patnaik’s submission that Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law would have been satisfied, even if the SSSA and 2014 SPA, as amended, were found to be illegal because of a breach of the FEMA Regulations or the laws of India.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 For the reasons set out above, I do not consider that the applicant, Mr Patnaik, has made out any of the grounds on which he seeks to set aside the Award and the Application is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Given those findings, Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit is not relevant to decide any issue on the Applications and, in respect of the Strike Out Application by the respondent, Nine Rivers, I order that Justice Patnaik’s Affidavit be struck out.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vivian Ramsey<br/>International Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ramachandran Doraisamy Raghunath and Josiah Fong Ren Jing (Peter Doraisamy LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Lopez, Vanathi Eliora Ray, and Kyle Yew Chang Mao (Joseph Lopez LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Pursuant to a Share Subscription and Shareholders Agreement dated 4 March 2010 (“the SSSA”), Nine Rivers Capital Limited (“Nine Rivers”) subscribed to various investor securities in Global Agrisystem Private Limited (“GAPL”), a company incorporated under the laws of India. Mr Patnaik and Katra Finance Limited (“Katra Finance”), a company incorporated under the laws of Mauritius, were defined as “Promoters” in the SSSA. Under the SSSA, the parties agreed to a “Qualified Exit”, <em>ie </em>that GAPL would undertake an initial public offering of its shares with a valuation of not less than INR 4,000,000,000. In the event that a Qualified Exit did not occur by 31 March 2014, Nine Rivers was entitled to exercise various rights under section 16.5 of the SSSA in order to secure its exit from GAPL.</p><p>2. The Qualified Exit did not occur by 31 March 2014. Thus, pursuant to processes under section 16.5 of the SSSA, the parties agreed that Katra Finance would purchase the securities owned by Nine Rivers for a sum of INR 302,500,000 (“the 2014 SPA”). When this did not happen, various amendments were made to the 2014 SPA which included, <em>inter alia</em>, making Mr Ramesh Vangal (“Mr Vangal”) an additional purchaser of the securities (“the 2015 Amendment”). However, neither Mr Vangal nor Katra Finance completed the purchase of the securities in accordance with the 2014 SPA, as amended by the 2015 Amendment.</p><p>3. On 16 December 2016, pursuant to section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA, Nine Rivers called upon Mr Patnaik and Katra Finance, as Promoters of the SSSA, to purchase the securities for INR 1,329,000,000 (“Investor Put Option”). Mr Patnaik and Katra Finance did not complete that purchase either. As a result, Nine Rivers commenced arbitration in the Singapore International Arbitration Centre on 5 May 2017 pursuant to an arbitration agreement contained in clause 11.12 of the 2014 SPA, as amended by the 2015 Amendment (“the Arbitration”). In the Arbitration, Nine Rivers sought payment from certain respondents, including Mr Patnaik and Katra Finance, for the securities that it held in GAPL</p><p>4. The arbitrator found that Mr Patnaik and Katra Finance were jointly and severally required to purchase the securities held by Nine Rivers pursuant to the Investor Put Option for INR 1,329,000,000 (“the Award”). Mr Patnaik then commenced the present Originating Summons No 4 of 2020 (“OS 4”), which was heard before the Singapore International Commercial Court, to set aside the Award under the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). Nine Rivers also filed Summons No 830 of 2020 (“SUM 830”) to strike out a new expert affidavit on Indian law filed by Mr Patnaik to show that the SSSA and the 2014 SPA were in breach of Indian law.<br/></p><p>The court’s decision</p><p>5.The court dismissed OS 4. First, the Award did not contain decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submissions to the Arbitration. The arbitrator correctly found that the arbitration agreement in clause 11.12 of the 2014 SPA, as amended by the 2015 Amendment, was widely drawn to cover disputes arising “out of or in relation to or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of” the 2014 SPA (at [<strong>83</strong>]). The issues of whether Nine Rivers was entitled to relief under section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA arose “out of or in relation to or in connection with the implementation of” the 2014 SPA (at [<strong>84</strong>]–[<strong>85</strong>]). This is because the failure of Mr Vangal and Katra Finance to meet their obligations under the 2014 SPA amounted to a “Default” under clause 8.1 of the 2014 SPA, and clause 8.1 of the 2014 SPA entitled Nine Rivers to exercise any other rights and remedies under the SSSA – which would include the right to exercise the Investor Put Option under section 17.2.2.1 of the SSSA – upon a “Default” (at [<strong>75</strong>]). Thus, the Award could not be set aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”).</p><p>6.Second, there was no breach of the rules of natural justice occurring in connection with the making of the Award. Mr Patnaik submitted that he had been deprived of the right to a fair hearing because the arbitrator did not allow Mr Patnaik to amend his pleadings at the start of the Arbitration. However, the court found that Mr Patnaik’s submission was essentially a challenge to the Arbitrator’s decision not to allow the amendment, rather than a challenge to the fairness of the hearing of the application to amend (at [<strong>121</strong>]). The amended pleadings were raised late by Mr Patnaik and slipped into opening submissions for the Arbitration. This led to Mr Patnaik having to make an application to amend. The parties were allowed to ventilate their submissions on the amendment application fully, both in writing and orally. The arbitrator allowed one amendment but disallowed two amendments only after hearing submissions from parties (at [<strong>122</strong>]–[<strong>127</strong>]). In the circumstances, there was no breach of the rules of natural justice and the Award could not be set aside under s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA.</p><p>7. Third, the Award was not in conflict with the public policy of Singapore. Mr Patnaik submitted that the SSSA and the 2014 SPA breached Indian law and Indian public policy because they are inconsistent with the Indian Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations (“FEMA Regulations”). Mr Patnaik submitted that it would therefore be a breach of international comity, and thus Singapore public policy, to allow the Award to stand. However, the arbitrator had already found that the SSSA and the 2014 SPA were not contrary to Indian law (at [<strong>182</strong>]–[<strong>186</strong>]). These are findings of fact which cannot be reopened by the court (at [<strong>187</strong>]) and, in any event, the court would not have intervened in the circumstances of this case (at [<strong>192</strong>]). Furthermore, even if the SSSA and 2014 SPA breached the FEMA Regulations, the threshold under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law is “very high”, and Mr Patnaik had not shown how the alleged breaches of the FEMA Regulations would “shock the conscience” or “violate the most basic notions of morality and justice” (at [<strong>201</strong>]–[<strong>204</strong>]). Consequently, the Award could not be set aside under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law. The court therefore allowed the application in SUM 830 and struck out the new evidence of Indian law.</p><p><em>This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
