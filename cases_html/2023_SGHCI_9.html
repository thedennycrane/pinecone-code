The responsible corporate vehicles of the Trust were Meadowsweet Assets Limited (“Meadowsweet”), Soothsayer Limited (“Soothsayer”) and Lynden Management Ltd (“Lynden”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Unfortunately, the Bank had within its ranks a fraudster, Mr Patrice Lescaudron (“Mr Lescaudron”), who was appointed as the Trust’s Relationship Manager (“RM”) and over the next 9 years misappropriated many millions of dollars from the Trust. His scheming and fraudulent conduct was not halted until 2015 when market forces intervened, with the inevitable consequences of his arrest and subsequent imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Swiss Correctional Court (the “Swiss Court”) found that Mr Lescaudron had: embezzled large amounts of money; purchased securities above market price causing damage to the plaintiff and to the Trust; and operated a scheme pursuant to which he opened various accounts and transferred moneys without the knowledge of either the plaintiff or the defendant for the purpose of covering losses in other clients’ accounts which he had caused.

Subsequently, there was the non-execution by CREDIT SUISSE Singapore of client orders and losses, which he had hidden from the client in the Excel tables sent to him, for fear of losing his client. He had then performed unauthorised trades to recover the loss. This had been the case at the end of 2009 and he had profited from transferring, through transfers or through the sale of securities at overly high prices, as part of the profit generated for other clients.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Lescaudron presented statements to the plaintiff which “did not reflect reality”.

His method of operation was at times apparently rather frantic and the money misappropriated from the Trust’s accounts was for “covering the losses generated by the trading operations that he had performed” in other clients’ accounts without their agreement.

The defendant and the Bank were successful at first instance in opposing the proceedings going forward in Singapore on the basis that the convenient forum was Switzerland. On appeal, after the plaintiffs discontinued the proceedings against the Bank and reshaped the proceedings seeking relief only from the defendant, the Court of Appeal allowed the proceedings as reconstituted to continue in this Court (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili, Bidzina and others v Credit Suisse Trust Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 638).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Although this is a matter of history, it is mentioned because the defendant contends that many of the plaintiffs’ claims are more appropriately characterised as claims against the Bank for which it contends the defendant cannot and should not be held liable. The defendant also contends that the consequence of the arrangements reached in the Settlement is that the plaintiffs have been fully compensated for any loss suffered not only by reason of Mr Lescaudron’s fraud but also by reason of the admitted breach of duty by the defendant in failing to keep the Trust assets safe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This contention is based in part on the nature of the arrangements under the Mandalay Trust.

However, it has dealt with the events post 31 December 2008 in its submissions on the basis that the Court may take a different view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiffs rely on events after that date as they contend they are relevant in reviewing the parties’ relationships and to the determination of the nature, extent and date or dates of the various breaches of duty they allege were committed by the defendant. It was submitted that it is also important to the determination of whether, if the Court finds there are breaches other than or in addition to the breach admitted by the defendant, the defendant is entitled to relief under s 60 of the Trustees Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Trustees Act”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the circumstances it will be necessary to consider the matter in far more detail than simply focussing on the parties’ relationship and relevant events up to 31 December 2008.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The setup of the Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties meet – 30 November 2004</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It was in 2004 after the plaintiff and Mr Malkin sold Mikhailovsky that the Bank approached him with a proposal that he place his funds with the defendant.

Mr Stamm “confirmed that all major documentation was in place” and the Singapore trusts with the underlying company had become “operational”. He “summarised the prepared investment proposal based on” the plaintiff’s “input” in November 2004 “consisting of non-discretionary fixed income-, as well as opportunistic-, partly discretionary elements”.

I followed up with Mr Lescaudron on this and raised this internally at the time with Peter Leppard, who was the Head of Trust Management. It was not uncommon for Mr Ivanishvili to give instructions to the RM directly for such payments to be made. I therefore did not find it unusual that Mr Ivanishvili would have on a fairly regular basis requested, and indeed expected, payments to be made immediately and at short notice, before the RM was able to obtain his signature on the instruction letters that CS Trust required for distributions or payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Ms Sim’s affidavit evidence conveyed the distinct impression that UPAs in respect of the Mandalay Trust were not a problem until 2010 and even then, there was no reason to regard them as suspicious.

</div> There is an issue as to whether the reference to “(21/02/2009)” was a typographical error which is discussed later at [474].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 The structure of the portfolio was described as “Mandate” at 288; “Advisor” at 118; and “Private” at 566. Mr Lescaudron suggested that the “Biordana Foundation” with “145 (Lukoil only)” should be added to the “Private” section of the portfolio. These numbers were stated not to include the Singapore assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 The “Mandate” section of the portfolio was described as the “central part” of the investment ensuring “a good level of profitability, higher than the benchmark with high security” which Mr Lescaudron advised gave the plaintiff significant credit opportunity and should not be changed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 The “Advisor” section of the portfolio was described as having “more active trading” which was “a more risky part than the Mandate part but with a higher expectation of annual profitability”. Mr Lescaudron advised that there would be more transactions on this part of the portfolio but with the “goal of achieving gains more rapidly”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 The “Private” section of the portfolio was described as comprising “Russian securities (Gazprom and Lukoil) and a few securities in the metals sector”. Mr Lescaudron recommended that the plaintiff keep the Russian securities because the Bank, as well as most other banks, was very positive about these securities. He also advised selling the remaining metal positions so the proceeds could be added to the Mandate part of the portfolio.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 Mr Lescaudron advised that in this strategy the plaintiff should “leverage” his positions “to increase [his] annual profitability”. The portfolio structure would then be: Management Mandate 364; Trading 118; and Russian Securities 635. He advised that the policy had changed in relation to the Russian securities and that credit of approximately 65% on Gazprom and Lukoil could be granted resulting in a maximum credit potential for the plaintiff of approximately USD 726m. He proposed that the plaintiff keep half of that amount “to profit from exceptional market situations (sharp drop in the indices, sharp drop in the precious metals, as in May 2006) in order to buy at low prices, as [he] did in a remarkable way last year”.

It records that Ms Peh prepared it on 29 April 2010 and recorded a portfolio value at year end of USD 65,860,689. It, along with all other IPPRs that were prepared, identified the “portfolio manager” as “CS”. This IPPR recorded a performance on the previous year’s comparison at -51.12% compared to Credit Suisse’s benchmark of -33.03%. It recorded “under performance” of -25.09%.

There was concern that Credit Suisse was not sure of the location of the artworks, whether they were kept in good condition and/or whether they were insured. One of the matters that was identified as a “Risk” was that “Unauthorized payments in substantial amounts are made by the bank’s RM from time to time in connection with the art collection”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 Mr Daniel Strazzer (“Mr Strazzer”), the Head of Legal and Compliance in CS Trust AG in Zurich, prepared a Memorandum dated 2 August 2007 with three options outlining possible ways “forward”. The three options proposed by Mr Strazzer were: (i) to stop any involvement of the defendant with the art collection; (ii) to stop any involvement of the defendant as trustee with the art collection but still provide services to the holding company Lynden; and (iii) for the defendant to stay involved as trustee with the art collection but try to reduce its current risk as trustee. Mr Strazzer suggested that the client would be “maybe unhappy” with the first option, “maybe happy” with the second option and “probably happy” with the third option.

He reviewed the structure in relation to the purchase of artworks by the plaintiff and noted that for each purchase of artwork the “client” would sign off the invoices issued by Sotheby’s or Christies and send them to the RM to arrange for payment from the Meadowsweet account. He also noted that in some instances the RM carried out the settlement directly without having received a payment instruction by the defendant representing Meadowsweet as account holder. Mr Ditrich observed that this led to UPAs which the defendant would subsequently investigate and having received a plausible explanation with corresponding documentation would authorise the settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 Mr Ditrich also observed that between April 2006 and April 2008, 245 pieces of artwork had been purchased but were not physically delivered to the defendant as trustee so that it was not able to “exercise the required control over the trust assets”. He also observed that it was not possible for the defendant to “trace whether artworks have meanwhile been sold”. However, he noted that if the paintings had been delivered to the defendant as trustee there would have been problems with safekeeping. Mr Ditrich regarded these arrangements as “unsatisfactory” and recorded that the situation of the trustee of the Mandalay Trust not having control over a substantial part of the trust assets had been brought to the attention of CST Group’s senior management by the defendant’s local senior management. Although the proposals to solve this situation had been evaluated in Mr Strazzer’s memorandum and submitted to the head of Credit Suisse Moscow in August 2007, this issue had not been resolved by the time Mr Ditrich made his site visit to Singapore in April 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 Mr Ditrich came up with the idea that because the plaintiff’s letter of 27 April 2006 did not “explicitly” indicate an intention to contribute the artworks into the Mandalay Trust to be held on behalf the beneficiaries, the artworks “would not be considered to form part of the trust assets”. Additionally, Mr Ditrich suggested that the payments out of the Meadowsweet account “could be regarded as distributions to the primary beneficiary. He noted that this “point of view” would need to be formally fixed in a letter of consent/understanding and submitted to the plaintiff for “sign off”.

If they had been treated as a charge to the profit and loss account, the accounts should faithfully represent and explain the nature of the adjustments so that the readers of the accounts can understand them. However, no such explanations were given in those accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">354 Mr Davies explained that treating the unauthorised payments as repayment of the shareholder effectively brought them to account as a distribution to the beneficiaries.

One point of significance made by Mr Davies was that the beauty of accounting, and specifically double-entry book-keeping, is that if proper books and records have been maintained, every item in a set of financial statements should be supported by a transaction or series of transactions.

Some contribution and distribution listings did not cover the same period as the Restated Financial Statements. Some documents contained details of the entity in which cash transactions occurred while others did not. There were instances where the value of a group of transactions did not appear to aggregate to the subtotal which was displayed beneath them. It was also unclear why those instances occurred and whether they should be taken into account in any analysis. Mr Davies also concluded that there were comments within some of the listings of contributions and distributions which introduced uncertainty as to their validity and many of the documents included a covering e-mail that did not include any background as to what the listing contained or the original purpose of the listing.

</div> Obviously if the accounts are not available to the trustee the duty to safeguard the assets may be compromised. Although one of Mr Birri’s tasks was to “reduce those late financial statements”, he knew that the defendant did not have enough resources to accomplish it. The defendant resorted to hiring of temporary staff to clear the backlog but even then it was not enough and the number of delinquent accounts increased.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">386 Mr Birri gave evidence prior to the defendant making its admission on the tenth day of the trial. His evidence exposed the huge deficiencies in the defendant’s processes and attitudes at the time that he was the head and executive director of the defendant. Mr Birri was policy-focused and appeared to be unable to see the true nature of an UPA. He did not appear to appreciate that every time millions of dollars went out of the Trust without authorisation the defendant’s duty to protect the Trust assets was compromised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">387 Mr Birri’s explanation that UPAs were not uncommon and that there were hundreds of them was, as Senior Counsel for the plaintiff put it rather neutrally, a “very unattractive” statement. Any attempt to justify inactivity or a lack of appropriate activity on the basis that there were a lot of UPAs is a most dangerous attribute in a trustee. As soon as a payment out of the trust funds is made without the trustee’s authority, steps should have been taken to stop it and if it did not cease, then the person who was guilty of such conduct irrespective of whether they were within the Bank and/or the defendant should have been prevented from having access to the Trust funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">388 It is also wrong-headed to suggest that this would have been difficult because Mr Lescaudron was in the Bank’s employ rather than the defendant’s employ. This was not a staffing arrangement matter. This was about access to assets in a Trust that was fully controlled by the defendant and it on its own and with and through its underlying companies were the appropriate decision makers as to who could have access to Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">389 There is now no issue that by 31 December 2008 the defendant breached its duty to the plaintiffs to safeguard the Trust assets. However, notwithstanding the defendant’s admission that it did “not dispute causation in this regard”, its position at the conclusion of the trial was that it was only liable to the plaintiffs for those funds that were misappropriated by Mr Lescaudron for which it claims the plaintiffs have been fully compensated by the Settlement with the Bank. The defendant argues that any other losses suffered by the plaintiffs fall outside the scope of its duty and are hence not recoverable.

They claimed that the defendant is liable to compensate the plaintiffs for the difference between what the portfolio would have achieved in the hands of that other institution and what was actually achieved, giving credit for what was paid in the Settlement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">410 The communications both oral and written over the years 2007/2008 to 2012 referred to at [270]–[281] earlier support the finding that the defendant was concerned that the documentation in place at the time (the Trust Deed and various minutes and letters) did not make clear that it was not liable for losses that may be incurred by reason of the loss or damage to the very valuable artworks that had been purchased by the plaintiff and over which it did not have physical custody.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">411 If there was already protection for the defendant from such liability in Clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed because the plaintiff had managed this investment and the defendant did not have full control of the investment, then the Deed of Amendment and Restatement may not have conferred a benefit on the defendant that it did not already enjoy. However, as discussed earlier, Lynden was established well after the acquisition of Meadowsweet and Soothsayer and there was no imposition of any restrictions or conditions on the defendant when the artworks were purchased and transferred into the Trust by the plaintiff. The defendant was therefore concerned to specify in detail, as it did in the Deed of Amendment and Restatement, that the defendant had no investment or asset management functions in respect of the artwork. However, it went further to provide that it had no investment or asset management functions generally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">412 The whole focus of the correspondence at the time of the drafting of the Deed of Amendment and Restatement was on the defendant’s exposure in respect of the artworks and the need to protect it from any liability in respect of the loss or damage to the artworks. The letter that the defendant drafted for the plaintiff to sign at the time referred to at [400] above recorded relevantly that the plaintiff (alone rather than all the beneficiaries) was “agreeable” to the Deed of Amendment and Restatement “to expressly accommodate the inherent investment needs of this unique asset class (ie. artwork)”. It is obvious that the expression inherent investment “needs” was a euphemism for the inherent investment “risks” from which that the defendant wished to be protected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">413 Even if it could be argued that the Deed of Amendment and Restatement conferred a benefit on one or more of the beneficiaries in respect of investment “needs”, the defendant could not exercise the power to vary the Trust Deed if it conferred a benefit on itself. This is clear from the wording of Clause 19 and the defendant does not suggest otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">414 Mr Birri’s candid evidence that the Trust Deed was amended to reduce the defendant’s risk in respect of the artwork is compelling support for the conclusion that it was to confer and did confer a benefit on the defendant. It is also compelling support for the proposition that the exercise of the power to vary the Trust Deed in Clause 19 of the Trust Deed was for that ulterior purpose rather than the permitted purpose of benefiting only the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">415 Although in the circumstances of the defendant’s admission it is probably unnecessary to determine this issue, if it had been necessary, the justifiable conclusion is that the Deed of Amendment and Restatement is void and/or unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reserved power trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">416 A mechanism that may be utilised to achieve a principal’s/settlor’s retention of control over the assets in a trust is the appointment of a beneficiary/settlor as an investment manager or investment advisor. This mechanism has been referred to as a reserved powers trust, the validity of which is not in issue. Section 90(5) of the Trustees Act provides: “No trust or settlement of any property on trust is invalid by reason only of the person creating the trust or making the settlement reserving to the person all or any powers of investment or asset management functions under the trust or settlement.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">417 The defendant claims that the Mandalay Trust operated as a reserved powers trust in which the plaintiff reserved to himself the power of investment of the Trust assets to the exclusion of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">418 The parties’ submissions focused significantly on clauses 10 and 16 and paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 4 of the Trust Deed. These provisions are the so-called “anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span>” clauses named after the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Barlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd</span> [1980] Ch 515.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">419 It is usual in a reserved powers trust for the Trust Deed to include anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett </span>provisions to provide the trustee with protection from liability where the settlor has control of the investments. This has been the subject of commentary in respect of a structure which includes underlying companies similar to that found in the present case, including relevantly in <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>as follows (at para 34-059):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) Even if the clause also relieves the trustee of any duty to interfere, it will afford no protection if the trustee does not stand aloof from the company. A corporate trustee which supplies employees as directors of a company held by the trust will have chosen to conduct its affairs and may be liable accordingly. It is common for trustees of offshore settlements to hold trust assets through holding companies: the holding company is administered by the trustee, its directors being officers or employees of the trustee. An anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clause in ordinary form will then provide no protection for the trustee. But where the underlying assets consist of one or more trading companies, the clause may be extended to cover such companies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(7) Even when there is a clause which comprehensively excludes any duty to supervise or interfere or make enquiries, the trustee necessarily retains the practical power to do those things by virtue of its control of the company. It has been contended that the trustee owes a residual or high-level duty to act in circumstances when no reasonable trustee would refrain from doing so. The contention, however, has been firmly rejected at the highest level in Hong Kong, in reliance on a sweeping anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clause, and we consider that the decision represents English law. In effect, therefore there is no public policy which requires the recognition of such a duty in the teeth of the trust instrument and its existence, if any, is a matter of construction of the instrument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">420 The decision referred to in the second paragraph extracted above is the judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zhang Hon Li and Ors v DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd and Ors</span> [2019] HKCFA 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Zhang</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">421 In <span class="font-italic">Zhang </span>the settlors were husband and wife who were customers of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd: at [9]. Before the trust was established, the settlors set up a BVI investment company, Wise Lords Ltd (“Wise Lords”) of which the wife was the sole director and shareholder: at [10]. After the Trust was established, the sole share in Wise Lords belonging to the wife was transferred to DBS Trustee HK (Jersey) Ltd and the wife was replaced as sole director of Wise Lords by DHJ Management Ltd, part of DBS Corporate Services (Hong Kong) Ltd: at [12]. DBS Corporate Services provided a nominee director for Wise Lords as well as company secretary services, a correspondence address and bank-authorised signatories. The wife was appointed Wise Lords’ investment advisor and authorised by Wise Lords to give investment instructions on its behalf: at [12].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">422 The Court of Final Appeal was considering anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett </span>clauses that were relevantly identical to the clauses in the present case and described them as follows at [64]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Anti-Bartlett provisions are generally incorporated in the Trust Deed in cases like the present because the parties wish to enable the settlor or the settlor’s nominee freely to exercise control and management of the underlying company, especially regarding matters such as its investment decisions, and to relieve the trustees of any management or supervisory duties in that regard (save where extreme situations such as those involving actual knowledge of dishonesty might arise). To postulate that the parties’ chosen scheme may be overridden by some implied, non-derogable external duty arising in circumstances “where no reasonable trustee could refrain from exercising otherwise excluded powers” would be to introduce an amorphous and ill-defined basis for undermining a legitimate arrangement consciously adopted by the parties, exposing the trustees to unanticipated risks of liability and sowing confusion as to the extent of their duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">423 The Court also referred to the “irreducible core of obligations” fundamental to the concept of a trust that was recognised by Millett LJ in <span class="font-italic">Armitage v Nurse</span> [1998] Ch 241 (“<span class="font-italic">Armitage v Nurse</span>”) as the duty of trustees to perform the trusts honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries and which did not include the duties of “skill and care, prudence and diligence”. Importantly, the Court said that those core obligations do not “operate to override express terms of a trust” but rather “provide a touchstone for deciding whether the minimum requirements for constituting a trust have been met”: at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">424 In the present case, there was the 2005 Letter of Appointment dated 7 March 2005 and the subsequent resolution by the defendant’s Trust Committee to appoint the plaintiff as the investment manager to the Mandalay Trust (see [102] and [108] above). In the 2005 Letter of Appointment, the plaintiff reserved the “right” to choose the investment manager who was recorded as being “responsible for making decisions as to the assets of the trust” and the “investment” of those assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">425 The purpose of the Memorandum of Wishes, also dated 7 March 2005, was “to assist in the administration of the trust and the exercise of any discretion and powers pursuant to the trust deed” (see [100] above). That memorandum recorded that during the plaintiff’s lifetime, the defendant “may have regard to his recommendations in respect of the investment of the Trust Fund, the beneficiaries of the Trust and any distributions to the beneficiaries”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">426 In<span class="font-italic"> Zhang</span>, one of the beneficiaries/settlors of the trust, the wife, was appointed as investment adviser and a Letter of Wishes was executed. That Letter of Wishes was in different terms to the Memorandum of Wishes in the present case. That Letter used mandatory rather than permissive language recording that during the beneficiary’s/settlor’s lifetime the trustee “should always consult her in the first place with regards to all matters and her recommendation should be final”: at [12].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">427 A trustee who is permitted to have regard to a beneficiary’s recommendations free of any direction that such be accepted as final is in a different position from a trustee who should, ought to or even must have regard to the beneficiary’s recommendation with the stipulation that it be treated as final. On one view, the former accommodates the prospect of the retention of control or some control of the investments in the trustee whilst the latter does not, except perhaps in exceptional circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">428 In any event, in the present case, where there is a reservation of control and the beneficiary/settlor exercises that control over the investment of assets in the Trust Fund, Clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed provides protection for the defendant from liability for loss caused by any action or inaction by the trustee by reason of its inability to exercise control over the subject assets (see [91] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">429 The defendant submitted that a reserved powers trust draws a very clear line between the duties of a trustee to safeguard trust assets and the duty of a trustee to review and monitor investment activity, which is excluded from the trustee’s obligations in such circumstances. The defendant submitted that it did not delegate the investment powers but rather such powers were “never vested” in the defendant.

Breach of the former duty occurs where the trustee <span class="font-italic">misapplies trust assets</span>. The trustee commits a different breach when he breaches his management stewardship duty; it occurs where he <span class="font-italic">fails</span> to <span class="font-italic">administer the trust fund in accordance with his equitable duties</span>, such as when he administers the trust negligently, in breach of his equitable duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">431 In <span class="font-italic">Appleby Corporate Services (BVI) Ltd v Sitco Trustees (BVI) Ltd</span> 17 ITELR 413 (“<span class="font-italic">Appleby</span>”), the investment manager of the trust appointed pursuant to an investment management agreement was to have complete discretion in investment decisions subject to a certain trading authority which set out how the fund was to be allocated. The trustee relied on an understanding that the settlor would monitor the asset allocation on a monthly basis. Although the trustee made enquiry with the investment manager on certain matters, it did not engage in systematic review of the portfolio to ensure that it complied with relevant guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">432 The Court held that even if the settlor had agreed to monitor the asset allocation monthly, it would not relieve the trustee of its “duty of care” to the beneficiaries of the trust: at [16]. It was held that had the trustee reviewed the conduct of the account regularly, it would have seen that the investment guidelines were not being complied with and unless it could rely on some exonerating provisions of the relevant statute or a trust document, it was liable to the trust for whatever damage had occurred because of its negligence in failing to keep the management of the fund under review: at [41], [42] and [55]. The plaintiffs relied on this decision in support of their contention that the defendant failed to keep the Trust assets under proper review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">433 The defendant submitted that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Appleby</span> is distinguishable because the trustee had powers of investment and exercised those powers.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">434 Although the defendant continued to make submissions that it was not obliged to monitor the wisdom of the Trust investments, it is certainly no part of the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant was in breach of such a duty. The plaintiffs do not complain about the defendant’s failure to monitor the wisdom of the investments. Rather it is the defendant’s failure to properly monitor the Trust so as to enable it to know whether the Trust assets were safe that is the subject of complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">435 The nature of a reserved powers trust that the defendant propounds is an ‘all or nothing’ concept. In that concept, if a settlor/beneficiary reserves powers of investment to himself or herself, then the trustee would have no powers of investment and no liability in respect of any loss resulting from the investment of the Trust assets. There is no room in that concept for the sharing of investment responsibilities between the trustee and the settlor/beneficiary. Such a restriction is not a prerequisite to the existence of such a trust. A trust arrangement is developed to fit the requirements of each beneficiary. The label is not the driver for the structure. The needs of the beneficiaries and the willingness of the trustee to take on the trustee responsibilities should be the drivers of the structure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">436 In Singapore, the concept of a shared arrangement with the settlor/beneficiary having investment powers over only parts of the Trust assets leaving the trustee with the investment powers over the residuum is recognised in the governing statute. Section 90(5) of the Trustees Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>discussed earlier refers to the reservation of “<span class="font-italic">all or any</span> powers of investment or asset management” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">437 The caution gleaned from the Court’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Zhang </span>not to introduce “amorphous and ill-defined” arrangements that may expose the trustees “to unanticipated risks of liability” and sow “confusion as to the extent of their duties” can be accommodated if care is taken to transparently set the parameters of the parties’ obligations and duties at the outset of the relationship.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Mandalay Trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">438 The Trust documentation that was put in place in the present case did not define or explain the ambit of the role of Investment Manager to the Mandalay Trust. The relevant internal CST Group Directive published some four years after the establishment of the Trust recorded the need to delegate the management of trust assets to a person with “special expertise” which had to occur by a “formal delegation” as an LPOA was not by itself a delegation. It also recorded that where a settlor/beneficiary acts as an “investment advisor” it was necessary to take “appropriate measures” such as clauses in the trust deed “to exclude or limit” the trustee’s liability.

</div> It also contended that by reason of the provisions of the 2005 Letter of Appointment and Clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed it was restricted from exercising any investment powers as they had been reserved to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">444 The 2005 Letter of Appointment did not use the language of the imposition of “restrictions” on the defendant as found in Clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed. Rather the letter imposed a “condition” on the transfer of the Trust assets to the defendant. It was a reservation to the plaintiff of “the right to choose” the investment manager or advisor (on a continuing basis) “and/or” “the right to choose” the investment of the Trust Assets. The 2005 Letter of Appointment also included additional words not found in the Trust Deed. It recorded that the investment manager or advisor “shall be responsible for making decisions as to the assets of the trust”. As discussed earlier, the Trust Deed does not define the term “investment manager or investment advisor” (see [99] and [438]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">445 The 2005 Letter of Appointment also recorded the plaintiff’s “wish” for the defendant to appoint him as “the initial investment manager to the trust”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">446 Clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed provides protection for the defendant from liability for losses resulting from the defendant’s action or inaction by reason of its inability “to have full control of the investment of those assets” the subject of any restrictions imposed on it. It also provided protection from liability for any action or inaction by reason of the defendant “following the advice of any such investment advisor”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">447 It is the former of these protections that the defendant relies upon. It submitted that it could not have full control of the investment of the assets because it was the plaintiff who was exercising such control. The defendant submitted that the powers of investment in clause 2 of the Fourth Schedule of the Trust Deed were never vested in the defendant.

That clause was the source of the defendant’s specific power to “engage the services of such investment advisor or advisors” from time to time as it thought fit to advise it “in respect of the investment and re-investment of the Trust Fund”. It was also a source of power to “delegate to the investment advisor discretion to manage all or any part of the Trust Fund within the limits and for the period stipulated” by the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">449 At its meeting on 7 March 2005, the Trust Committee of the defendant resolved that the plaintiff be appointed as “Investment Manager to the Mandalay Trust pursuant to the terms of the said trust”. There was no identification of which “terms of the said trust” pursuant to which the Committee was purporting to appoint the plaintiff. There was no identification of whether the plaintiff was to manage or was delegated to manage all or any part or parts of the Trust Fund nor was there any indication of any limits stipulated by the defendant. There is no evidence that the plaintiff was ever informed of the resolution. Indeed, as the plaintiff said in evidence, if he had been informed that it was his responsibility, rather than the defendant’s responsibility, to manage all the investments, it would have been the end of his relationship with the defendant and the Bank (see [456] below).

</div> One conclusion to be drawn from these circumstances is that it is more probable that the Investment Strategy document was forwarded to the plaintiff by Mr Lescaudron in February 2007 and that the reference “21/02/2009” was a typographical error. However, even if was sent on 21 February 2009 it is only a very short time after the date the plaintiff claims he ceased the management of the Russian shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">475 The plaintiffs submitted that in any event the document does not record any instructions originating from the plaintiff to make investments in Russian securities. Nor does it refer to Russian shares or securities being part of the Mandalay Trust.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">476 The plaintiffs submitted that the fact that the plaintiff agreed with the defendant’s proposals or recommendations and/or the Bank’s proposals or recommendations does not mean that he was managing the investments. Rather, it was submitted, it demonstrates that it was the defendant who was making those decisions with the arrangement between Meadowsweet and the Bank and at times discussing some of them with the plaintiff. Of course, there was a great deal that was not discussed with or disclosed to the plaintiff as Mr Lescaudron pursued his fraudulent activities covering them up with false reports and a tissue of lies and moving money as he pleased to fill the gaps in his trading activity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">477 On balance, the Investment Strategy document does not detract from the plaintiff’s evidence that he managed the investment in the Russian shares and precious metals up to 2008 and not beyond that date. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">478 It is clear from the plaintiff’s evidence that he regarded himself as being in control of the investment of the Russian shares and precious metal investments up to the end of 2008. In the circumstances a finding is made that the plaintiff managed and was in control of the investment of the Russian shares and precious metal investments from 2005 up to the end of 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">479 A finding is also made that the other Trust assets over which the plaintiff had control of the investment were the USD 100m for the GCF and USD 100m loan to the directors of the TBC Bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">480 The plaintiff identified the art collection as a matter over which he had control. This appears to be a non-contentious admission because it does not relate to any assessment that was carried out by the experts in assisting the Court in respect of the process for assessing any quantification of damages. The same position pertains to the GCF and TBC Bank ‘investments’. The artworks were purchased by the plaintiff, and he did not depend upon the defendant to give advice or indeed to have physical control of those Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">481 The Raptor shares were clearly managed by Mr Lescaudron. His fraudulent activity with forged communications purporting to have been approved by the plaintiff were obviously calculated to ensure that he was able to continue with his activity earning millions of dollars in commissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">482 The fact that there was concurrent management of the Trust assets, part by the plaintiff and part by the defendant through Meadowsweet and Soothsayer with the Bank and the Singapore Bank is consistent with the plaintiff’s 2005 Letter of Appointment. He exercised his right to choose the investment in Russian shares and precious metals between 2005 and 2008. He also exercised his right in respect of the art collection, the GCF and the loan to the shareholders of TBC Bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">483 The plaintiff managed the investments of these Trust assets whilst the defendant through its underlying companies managed the investment of other Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">484 The plaintiff accepted in evidence, that he (and not the defendant) was responsible for any losses suffered on those investments that he managed in that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">485 This does not detract from the ability to apply the label of a reserved powers trust to the arrangement between the parties. It is necessary to determine in each case the extent of the reservation and the consequences of that reservation. The protection in clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed applied to those assets that were managed by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">486 The plaintiffs claimed that during the administration of the Trust, the defendant committed repeated and flagrant breaches of its duties. They claimed that the defendant was informed of relevant transactions in respect of which it had an obligation to act and in respect of which it failed to do so. The plaintiffs claim that this commenced in 2007 and over the next 8 years a “catalogue of failures” occurred including: permitting misappropriation of the Trust assets; failing to detect Mr Lescaudron’s forgeries; permitting the Trust assets to be managed by an unauthorised individual; failing to monitor the performance of the Trust assets; failing to keep proper records; failing to accurately account to the beneficiaries; and dishonestly concealing the fraud on the Trust accounts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The duty to safeguard the Trust assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">492 The defendant deployed a new expression during its final oral submissions. It relates to both the defendant’s duties as trustee and the extent of the defendant’s admission made on the tenth day of the trial. The expression deployed was that as trustee the defendant had an obligation to “police the perimeter” of the Trust. That expression is not taken from any authority and the defendant candidly indicated that it is its own creation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">493 The defendant submitted that its duty to safeguard the Trust assets is not one of strict liability but one in which it is required to take reasonable care to “police the perimeter” of the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">494 It is inappropriate to adopt the defendant’s nomenclature in respect of its duty to the plaintiffs as “policing the perimeter of the trust” because (in the language of the Court of Final Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zhang</span>) it would introduce an “amorphous and ill-defined” concept which has the capacity to undermine a “legitimate arrangement consciously adopted by the parties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">495 It is not in issue that for the defendant to comply with its duty to safeguard the Trust assets it had to ensure that no monies left the Trust without its authorisation and/or without it knowing the identity of the recipient of those Trust assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">496 The breadth of the defendant’s admission is significant. It admitted that by 31 December 2008, when it saw the perimeter of the Trust being breached by unauthorised payments away, it should have notified the beneficiaries, or at least notified the plaintiff. Its admission included the very important step of “directly contacting” the plaintiff/beneficiary to verify the payments in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">497 The obligations recognised in the terms of the defendant’s admission sit within the irreducible core of obligations described by Millett LJ in <span class="font-italic">Armitage v Nurse</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 253–254<span class="font-italic">. </span>This is what the defendant had to do to meet the obligation to perform the trust honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the plaintiffs. It knew that millions and millions of dollars and euros were leaving its custody of the Trust without its authorisation, and to discharge its core obligations it was required at the very least to inform the plaintiffs of that position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">498 It is not enough to sit by and observe the Trust at its edge or perimeter. Once the events alert a trustee that something is amiss inside the perimeter, as the defendant accepts occurred in the present case by 31 December 2008, the trustee was required to act honestly and in good faith and advise the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">499 This does not run counter to the finding in<span class="font-italic"> Zhang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51] that there were no “high level supervisory duties” imposed on the trustee in that case. Rather this analysis and conclusion flows from the defendant’s admission of breach. In any event, there is an important distinction between a high-level supervisory duty over the wisdom of investments and a high-level supervisory duty over the safety of the trust assets. In <span class="font-italic">Zhang</span>, the Court firmly rejected the existence of the former and the latter duty was not in issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The date of breach of duty to safeguard the Trust assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">500 Although the defendant admitted that it breached its duty to safeguard the Trust assets by 31 December 2008, it does not accept that it was in breach of its duty prior to that date. It accepts that the admitted breach as at 31 December 2008 was continuing and caused loss and damage to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">501 The plaintiffs contended that the defendant was in breach of its duty to safeguard the Mandalay Trust assets earlier than 31 December 2008. It was submitted that as early as December 2006 the defendant had identified the real risk of employee fraud from Mr Lescaudron’s conduct. The plaintiffs contended that the defendant was in breach of its duty to safeguard the Mandalay Trust Assets as early as 2007, and certainly no later than March 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">502 As the defendant’s only admission of breach is that it failed in its duty to safeguard the Mandalay Trust assets as at 31 December 2008, it will be necessary to determine whether the defendant was in breach of such duty earlier than the admitted date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">503 The plaintiffs claimed that by the end of 2006, the defendant knew that Mr Lescaudron’s conduct was a fraud risk and that it needed to take immediate action in response. The defendant submitted that there is no basis for this claim. It referred to the e-mail from Ms Sim of 12 December 2006 (see [172] above) and emphasised that the words “this would gravely affect the integrity” of the plaintiff’s “trust structure” suggest Ms Sim’s concern was to uphold the integrity of the Trust rather than demonstrating any concern about a “potential fraud”.

</div> The defendant contended that this demonstrates that Mr Low was concerned about upholding the integrity of the Trust and not the risk of potential fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">505 Similarly, the defendant relied on the words in Ms Teng’s correspondence referring to the “validity” of the Trust structure becoming “questionable”. It submitted that this demonstrates a concern quite different from a concern about a potential fraud risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">506 The defendant also submitted that Mr Ditrich’s correspondence in December 2006 is demonstrative of a primary focus on “considerable regulatory and legal risks” which it claimed mirrors Ms Teng’s concerns of upholding “the integrity of the Trust”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">507 The defendant’s analysis of Mr Ditrich’s correspondence, including the Legal and Compliance Alert attached to it, downplays Mr Ditrich’s obvious concern in respect of Mr Lescaudron’s conduct. The Alert referred to the danger of causing “invalidity of the Trust as a whole” and thus making it impossible for the Trust to achieve the purpose for which it was created. It is certainly true that there was no express statement within the Alert that UPAs were “red flags of fraud”.

</div> However, it is obvious that when Mr Ditrich referred to an RM organising UPAs with the consequence of benefiting anybody including himself with a risk of employee fraud in the extreme case, Mr Ditrich was clearly concerned about the prospect of fraud and was wishing to avoid a fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">508 The irresistible conclusion from the correspondence is that Mr Ditrich’s concerns and the concerns of others involved in the communications were certainly not limited to maintaining the integrity of the structure. A very senior officer of Credit Suisse referring to the prospect of employee fraud in open communications to his colleagues in this fashion is a most serious matter and one that suggests that, as early as 2006, there was a concern that what was happening might, albeit in the extreme case, amount to a fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">509 The defendant also submitted that because UPAs were “not uncommon,” they were not seen as a “red flag of fraud”.

They included that payments should not be made without Clementi’s signature approving the transaction. Notwithstanding these clear directions, Mr Lescaudron embarked on a spree using the Trust assets clearly unconstrained and apparently unburdened by the defendant’s directions paying out over USD 46.6m in one day on 11 May 2007 (see [212] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">518 In July 2007, Mr Lescaudron opened the new accounts for Meadowsweet without authorisation and embarked on the share trade churn whilst at the same time effecting the Overvalue Misappropriations for which more than ten years later, he would be convicted and imprisoned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">519 The defendant submitted rather extraordinarily that the evidence of its own witness, Ms Sim, that Mr Lescaudron should have been precluded from dealing with the Trust assets “as early as 2007” should not be given weight.

</div> this was not the language deployed by Ms Sim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">520 Although the defendant suggested that it was the November 2008 transactions that were the sea change and the tipping point, the March 2008 transactions were just as extraordinary and in some respects even more extraordinary than the November 2008 transactions. The March 2008 transactions occurred over two days close to each other, seven transactions on the first day and two on the second day. The twelve relevant November 2008 transactions occurred on the one day. The March 2008 transactions totalled EUR 10.72m and USD 7.731m whereas the November 2008 transactions totalled EUR 5.729m and USD 4.396m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">521 The March 2008 transactions were not surrounded by market turmoil and the GFC whereas the November 2008 transactions occurred in close proximity to these events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">522 The March 2008 transactions were much closer in time to the defendant’s direction to Mr Lescaudron of how the Trust arrangement and transactions should be conducted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">523 Although the defendant’s witness, Ms Sim, made the concession that Mr Lescaudron should have been precluded from having access to the Trust assets as early as 2007, that was a response in cross-examination which should be taken into account with the further analysis above to decide the date upon which the defendant was in breach of its duty to safeguard the Trust assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of duty 30 March 2008</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">524 In all the circumstances and having regard to the events between late 2006 and March 2008 it is clear that by no later than March 2008, any individual or professional trustee, acting honestly and in good faith in compliance with its duty to safeguard the Trust Assets, would have had no justification for continuing to allow Mr Lescaudron to have access to the Trust assets. The failure to preclude such access by no later than 30 March 2008 (allowing for notice of the payments out without authority) was a breach of the defendant’s duty to the plaintiffs to safeguard the Trust assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability for consequences of breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">525 The defendant contended that if there is a finding of breach earlier than the admitted breach then it is entitled to the protection from liability for any damages suffered in respect of assets over which it did not have full control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">526 The starting point in this consideration is clause 10(b) of the Trust Deed extracted again here for context:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Should any person when transferring assets to the Trust Fund impose any restrictions on the Trustees in relation to those assets with regard to (1) the choice of investment manager or investment advisor or (2) the investment thereof, the Trustee shall be bound thereby but the Trustee shall not in any circumstances be liable for any loss, damage, depreciation to those assets which may result from any action or inaction of the Trustees by virtue of the inability of the Trustees to have full control of the investment of those assets or by virtue of the Trustees following the advice of any such investment advisor and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Trust Fund in respect of all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses whatsoever in relation thereto. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">527 The plaintiffs contended that the defendant is unable to claim the protection of the anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clauses because it has not remained “aloof” from Meadowsweet and Soothsayer as the operative investment companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">528 The defendant submitted that although the trustee in <span class="font-italic">Zhang </span>was not completely “aloof” from the investment company, the Court did not see this as an impediment to giving effect to the anti<span class="font-italic">-Bartlett</span> clauses. As discussed earlier the Trust arrangements in <span class="font-italic">Zhang </span>were different from those in the Mandalay Trust.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The trustee’s obligations in <span class="font-italic">Zhang </span>to treat the investment adviser’s recommendations as “final” were different from the position in the Mandalay Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">529 The defendant submitted that in a reserved powers trust it is unexceptional for the trustee to provide administrative services to facilitate the running of the business under the trust. It is also submitted that as long as the trustee does not manage the business itself, there is no inconsistency between the trustee being the owner and director of the investment company and clauses in the trust documentation excluding the trustee’s power and duty to manage and invest the trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">530 The defendant contended that this was the case with Meadowsweet. There is no dispute that the defendant owned the shares in Meadowsweet and appointed Meadowsweet’s directors. There is also no dispute that the directors were the signatories of Meadowsweet’s bank account with the Bank. It was submitted that these directors did not participate in the investment or management of the funds in those bank accounts. Rather, this was carried out by Mr Lescaudron and, as the defendant claimed, under the direction of the plaintiff and Mr Bachiashvili as the appointed investment managers of the Mandalay Trust. The defendant emphasised the plaintiff’s evidence that he looked to the Bank, and not to the defendant, to manage the investments of the Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">531 The defendant submitted that in all the circumstances of this case, there is no basis on which the anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clauses would not apply and protect it from liability for the loss suffered by the plaintiffs by reason of its breach of duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">532 The plaintiffs contended that the defendant exercised complete control over the investment companies and, therefore, the anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clauses are simply inapplicable. They submitted that even if the defendant had no duty to involve itself in the management of the companies, it was not relieved of the duty to satisfy itself that nothing untoward was affecting the Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">533 The plaintiffs submitted that <span class="font-italic">Zhang</span> is distinguishable from the present circumstances. It was submitted that in <span class="font-italic">Zhang</span> the Court held that the anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clause excluded any supervisory duty for the trustee to keep itself informed about the affairs of the holding company because of the very specific circumstance that the subject investments had been made at the instigation of one of the plaintiffs. It was submitted that the distinguishing feature to the present case is that there was a very close interconnection between the Bank and the defendant, and the investments were made through the Bank’s employees, including Mr Lescaudron, and employees of the defendant. It was submitted that although the defendant pleaded a case and tried to suggest it was effectively and functionally independent of the Bank, this was resoundingly exposed through the trial to be false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">534 The plaintiffs submitted that there is justified academic criticism that <span class="font-italic">Zhang</span> “went too far”. It was submitted that a trustee who ignores a significant fall in profits and then relies on an exemption clause to refuse to enquire about such a fall should lose the protection of the exemption clause: <span class="font-italic">Underhill &amp; Hayton, Law of Trusts and Trustees</span> (20th ed, LexisNexis 2022) at para 51.55.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">535 The plaintiffs also submitted that if anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett</span> clauses can displace many, if not all, of the defendant’s obligations, then the nature of the trust fails to have any resonance. However, the plaintiffs point out that if, as admitted, the defendant has an irreducible core duty to safeguard trust assets from being misappropriated, it must follow that the defendant has an irreducible core duty to account which must necessarily involve reviewing and monitoring the Trust assets. Otherwise, the defendant would not be able to safeguard the assets from being misappropriated and to account for them to the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">536 The plaintiffs submitted that there is clear evidence that the defendant regarded itself as owing fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs and that it regarded the duty to review and monitor the Trust assets as a facet of those duties.

The anti-<span class="font-italic">Bartlett </span>clauses protect the defendant from liability for any losses suffered in respect of the assets the investment of which the plaintiff was managing. They do not protect the defendant from liability for losses suffered in respect of the assets the investment of which the defendant was managing through Meadowsweet and/or Soothsayer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">538 The defendant accepted that one of the alternative consequences of its admitted breach of duty as at 31 December 2008 was that the whole portfolio would have been removed from the defendant and placed with another trustee. However, the defendant does not accept that this was an alternative consequence of any breach that the Court may find occurred earlier than 31 December 2008. The defendant submitted that this is not a probable consequence because Mr Lescaudron would have been able to give a plausible explanation for his conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">539 The defendant’s submission focuses more on Mr Lescaudron’s capacity to deceive the defendant (and others) rather than the nature of the disclosure that should properly have been made to the plaintiffs by no later than 30 March 2008 in respect of the defendant’s duty to safeguard the Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">540 The disclosure to the plaintiffs in March 2008 should have been made with the appropriate candour and transparency expected of a trustee acting honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the beneficiaries. That disclosure would include the detail of the unsuccessful efforts since December 2006 to rein Mr Lescaudron in to prevent him from paying millions of dollars and millions of euros out of the Trust accounts without authority. This would then have exposed the desultory nature of the defendant’s efforts in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">541 The plaintiff’s evidence, which is accepted, that had he known that he was supposed to manage the investment of all the Trust assets, he would have ended his relationship with the Bank and the defendant, makes it more probable than not that had he known in March 2008: (a) that Mr Lescaudron had been paying away millions of dollars and millions of euros of Trust monies without authorisation; and (b) of the desultory efforts of the defendant to stop Mr Lescaudron from doing so, he would have ended the relationship with the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">542 In support of its contention that it is not responsible for any losses beyond the funds that were misappropriated by Mr Lescaudron, the defendant submitted that any such losses were outside the scope of its duty to the plaintiffs. It submitted that just because it admitted that if it had performed its duty to safeguard the Trust assets Mr Lescaudron would have been removed from having access to the Trust assets by 31 December 2008, that did not mean that the investment losses beyond the misappropriations can be “pegged” to the breach of duty to safeguard the assets.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">543 The defendant relied upon several authorities for the proposition that in awarding equitable compensation, the Court must assess the nature of the duty, the scope of the duty that has been breached and the loss that flows from that breach (see <span class="font-italic">South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd </span>[1997] AC 191 at 211H and 213E; <span class="font-italic">Manchester Building Society v Grant Thornton UK LLP </span>[2021] 3 WLR 81; <span class="font-italic">Main v Giambrone &amp; Law (a firm) </span>[2017] EWCA Civ 1193; <span class="font-italic">LIV Bridging</span> <span class="font-italic">Finance Ltd v EAD Solicitors LLP </span>[2020] EWHC 1590 (Ch)). The defendant claimed that the losses alleged by the plaintiffs did not fall within its “scope of duty” or did not flow from the breach of its duty to safeguard the Trust assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">544 The losses that flowed from the defendant’s breach of trust are not limited to the funds that were stolen by Mr Lescaudron. The Trust assets, as a whole, were vulnerable to Mr Lescaudron’s fraudulent manipulation in support of the deceitful scheme that he had constructed and implemented. This manipulation included not only outright theft of funds but also the movement of funds into and out of investments to enable Mr Lescaudron to cover his tracks and losses to keep his scheme afloat and to earn him millions of dollars and/or euros in commissions. These so called ‘investments’ were the vehicles he used to achieve his fraudulent goals. These investments were sometimes unsuitable and at other times overconcentrated. However, but for those that were managed by the plaintiff, they were all part of Mr Lescaudron’s scheme. The fact that he was permitted to continue in his role was causative of the losses beyond the misappropriations suffered by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">545 The defendant’s submission that is not responsible for any losses beyond the funds that were misappropriated by Mr Lescaudron because such losses were outside the scope of its duty to the plaintiffs to safeguard the Trust assets is not accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">546  If the defendant had advised the plaintiff directly on 30 March 2008 of the conduct by Mr Lescaudron in making the unauthorised payments away, as it was its duty to do so, not only would Mr Lescaudron’s access to the Trust assets been removed but it is more probable than not that the whole portfolio would have been removed to another professional trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">547 The consequence of the breach by the defendant in failing to safeguard the Trust assets as at 30 March 2008 is that it is liable to the plaintiffs for the difference between the value of the portfolio that was not affected by fraud and would have been managed by a professional, competent trustee and the value of the portfolio managed by the defendant, subject to the matters dealt with below relating to the quantification of the plaintiffs’ loss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contributory negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">548 The defendant submitted that any damages awarded to the plaintiffs for the breach of its duty to safeguard the Trust assets should be reduced by reason of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence in failing to monitor and manage the investment of the Trust assets.

</div> Mr Lescaudron then stopped sending the Bank statements. Mr Bachiashvili explained that “it was clear – to him and to me that the Excel was more convenient way to report” because he “was also not interested in the particular composition of the portfolios”. Mr Bachiashvili took Mr Lescaudron’s reports “at face value” in reporting the bottom-line figure to the plaintiff.

It was submitted that this gave Mr Lescaudron the opportunity to defraud the Mandalay Trust and that the plaintiff and Mr Bachiashvili should have foreseen this. It was submitted that as a sophisticated investor and businessman, the plaintiff must have known that there was minimal supervision of Mr Lescaudron and that this created the opportunity for Mr Lescaudron to take advantage of his position.

Lord Tyre observed at [39] and [40] that “Scots law” had never adopted the “English dichotomy between law and equity” and was “untroubled by historic distinctions between law and equity”. His Lordship found ( at [66]) the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Rodger in <span class="font-italic">Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (Nos 2 and 4) </span>[2002] 3 WLR 1547, that there was no contributory negligence defence to a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation, as a “highly persuasive” basis to conclude that the same position should pertain under Scots law.

In contrast the fiduciary relationship is where “one party exercises power on behalf of another and pledges himself or herself to act in the best interests of the other”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">562 In contrast to the Scots law as explained in <span class="font-italic">Kidd </span>there was recognition in <span class="font-italic">Pilmer v Duke</span> that in Australia “the substantive rules of equity have retained their identity as part of a separate and coherent body of principles” (at [173]). Reference was made to the High Court’s various judgments establishing that “losses sustained by reason of a breach of duty by a trustee or other fiduciary is determined by equitable principles” and that there were “severe conceptual difficulties in the path of acceptance of notions of contributory negligence as applicable to diminish awards of equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty” (at [85]–[86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">563 The defendant rightly pointed out that some of these observations were <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>however it is inconsistent with the trustee’s core obligation to keep the Trust assets safe that a beneficiary should be bound to protect himself or herself against a trustee breaching such a profoundly important obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">564 The defendant’s contention that the breach of its duty is simply a breach of its duty of care in tort is not accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">565 When a trustee fails to safeguard trust assets it is in breach of an equitable duty to the beneficiaries: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping </span>at [100].

A defence of contributory negligence is not available to the breach as found.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">566 Notwithstanding this finding it is for completeness appropriate to deal with the plaintiffs’ responses to the defendant’s contentions. The plaintiffs submitted that it is simply not open to the defendant to advance a defence of contributory negligence which is both unpleaded and unsupported by the evidence.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">583 The plaintiffs submitted that the Court should draw the following adverse inferences: that the defendant deliberately withheld documents because these documents would harm its case and support the plaintiffs’ cases; that the defendant was able, but refused to, obtain relevant documents from the Bank because these documents would be damaging to its case and support the plaintiffs’ cases; that the defendant did not recall Mr Birri and Ms Sim to give direct evidence on e-mails to which they were party that were disclosed after the conclusion of their evidence because their evidence would be harmful to the defendant’s case; that the defendant refused to call Mr Guldimann to give evidence in relation to his restatement exercise because it would show that the defendant acted dishonestly to conceal the fraud; and that the defendant refused to call any witnesses from its compliance team because they worked closely with the Bank’s compliance team, which had actual knowledge of Mr Lescaudron’s fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">584 It is appropriate to take into account the pressures and complexities of the preparation for and conduct of the trial, including the numerous amendments to the pleadings. Notwithstanding these considerations, the process of ongoing discovery/disclosure by the defendant during the trial was at times rather chaotic. There certainly appeared to be a lack of a disciplined approach to compliance with its discovery/disclosure obligations with the need for the plaintiffs to persist in their applications for proper compliance by the defendant. Numerous affidavits had to be filed by the defendant correcting earlier affidavits in relation to the defendant’s list of documents and the plaintiffs had to deal with all of this whilst running the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">585 However, I am not satisfied that adverse inferences should be drawn that the defendant deliberately withheld documents or that it refused to seek documents from the Bank. Rather the defendant’s conduct in respect of its discovery/disclosure referred to above was consistent with its desultory efforts to rein in Mr Lescaudron demonstrating a lack of proper and disciplined commitment to its legal obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">586 The plaintiffs could have sought leave to further cross-examine either or both Mr Birri and Ms Sim after the production of the subject e-mails but chose not to do so. The defendant’s failure to recall them itself for further evidence-in-chief is not a basis for the adverse inference sought by the plaintiffs not least for the reason that it is unnecessary in light of the conclusions that the defendant is not entitled to be excused under section 60 of the Trustees Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">587 The absence of Mr Guldimann from the witness box is in a different category. Certainly, there were matters in respect of the restatement exercise that required explanation with the reasonable expectation that the defendant would have called Mr Guldimann to provide that explanation. It is appropriate in the circumstances to infer that the defendant chose not to call him because his evidence would not have assisted its case and supported the plaintiffs’ claims. It is appropriate to infer adversely to the defendant that its failure to call Mr Guldimann supports the finding that the restatement of the accounts did not accurately reflect the reality of the transactions effected by Mr Lescaudron and is further support for the finding that the defendant did not act in good faith when it failed to disclose Mr Lescaudron’s fraud to the plaintiffs in a timely fashion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">588 The absence of members of the compliance team from the witness box is not a basis for a further inference adverse to the defendant. The witnesses who were called made appropriate admissions during their cross-examination that the defendant should have prevented Mr Lescaudron from having access to the Trust assets from as early as 2007 (see [195] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Expert issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">589 The issue for determination which arises from the defendant’s breach of its duty to the plaintiffs is what would have happened if the Trust assets had not been affected by fraud and had been placed with a competent and professional portfolio manager as at the date of breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">590 To assist the Court in determining this and related issues, the parties have relied on experts in wealth management and forensic accounting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">591 As discussed earlier, the forensic accounting experts who assisted the Court in this regard were Mr Davies, whose affidavits and reports were read by the plaintiffs, and Mr Nicholson, whose affidavits and reports were read by the defendant. The wealth management/investment management experts who assisted the Court were Mr Morrey, whose affidavit and reports were read by the plaintiffs, and Ms Mayr, whose affidavits and reports were read by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">592 There is no issue that each of the experts who assisted the Court is suitably and relevantly qualified and expert in their respective fields as described in their written evidence. Their tasks were clearly vast, and it is obvious that the experts applied themselves diligently, professionally and honestly to those tasks. The system of expert assistance to the Court is integral to the proper administration of justice and it is appropriate to recognise that invaluable service in this matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">593 The experts were required to construct alternative medium-risk portfolios for each of the Meadowsweet accounts, the Soothsayer accounts, and the CS Life Meadowsweet accounts.

Those documents were: (i) investment reports that describe assets and liabilities for each account and which show the balances on particular dates; (ii) statements of safekeeping with details for all accounts at particular dates; and (iii) statements of account which show the cash transactions for cash accounts associated with each trust account typically covering quarterly or biannual periods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">609 For the Specific Transaction Models, the three broad classes of items that were considered by the experts were: (i) the unsuitable positions; (ii) the overconcentrated positions; and (iii) the unauthorised transfers which contain both misappropriations and transactions at an overvalue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">610 The differences between the experts in respect of the calculation of loss on the unsuitable positions arises by reason of their respective applications of the different conclusions reached by Mr Morrey or Ms Mayr. Mr Morrey and Ms Mayr had different methods for determining whether a position was unsuitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">611 Overconcentrated positions were those in which there was too much of a particular investment in the fund. Mr Davies and Mr Nicholson assessed what was necessary to reduce those overconcentrated positions to acceptable levels within the fund, took the money that would have been realised by selling down those positions and reinvested it in Benchmark Portfolios.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">612 Some investments were both overconcentrated and unsuitable. Where this occurred Mr Nicholson and Mr Davies adjusted that overlap and translated that into the figures as calculated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">613 One difference between these experts is how they dealt with the complicated and esoteric circumstance “where the counterfactual goes negative”. This is seen most obviously in Model 4, overconcentration. Mr Davies dealt with this by allowing it to go “negative” in the exercise.

For certain transactions, they agreed that the losses would be calculated assuming that in the “but for” position, the transfers would still have taken place, but at market value instead of at an overvalue. For the others, Mr Davies’ calculations assumed that the transfers would not have taken place at all. The total difference in quantification arising from the differing approaches is USD 2.94m (4%).

It is therefore necessary to decide which of those two indices should apply. The total return index reflects investment performance which will have had dividends and other distributions retained and reinvested; whereas the price-only index reflects capital growth without taking account of the reinvestment of dividends.

So once we see they start to compound the investment return, they start to produce their own investment return within the benchmark, very standard compounding of investment growth that you get with most investment types.

I think, for me, what it comes down to we were instructed to produce the alternative return that an investor might reasonably be expected to achieve and the return investor would reasonably expect to achieve would include dividends and would include reinvestment, the compound growth on their investments. By using price-only, essentially dividends vanish into thin air. They’re just nowhere in the return and so that’s not the way an investor would experience owning, sharing or holding an ETF that’s tracking one of these indices. They would benefit from the dividends, they would benefit from the compounding of those dividends, so that’s why I’m happy that the total return is the right answer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">642 Ms Mayr rejected Mr Morrey’s proposition that the “dividends vanish into thin air”. Her evidence in response was that she was not saying that the underlying dividends of the invested shares could not be produced and reinvested.

The total return index assumes the full $4 dividend is reinvested in equities whereas what the portfolio manager in the underlying portfolio would do is reinvest only $1.60 being 40% of $4.

Mr Morrey was “confident” that in 2011 an investment manager would not have regarded that 2005 solution as “appropriate for achieving the investment purpose” and it would not have been “the optimum portfolio construction”. This is particularly in the context of interest rates plummeting by 2008 such that bond rates would not beat inflation and the “remarkable bull run” in equities from 2009 onwards.

Mr Davies observed that “different types of mischief” carried out by Mr Lescaudron had been identified and it was “very likely” that other yet undiscovered mischief had occurred. The experts did not know what the trading policy was or indeed whether there was a trading policy behind the investments that took place within the Trust. There were “scores of challenges”, but the experts accepted those limitations and challenges and were able to reach agreement on most matters.

This opinion was based on the comparison of the amount calculated on the Whole Portfolio Model with the amounts in the other Models. The fact that the amount is greater under the Whole Portfolio Model is not a basis for rejecting it. Rather, it is necessary to decide as a matter of principle, irrespective of the total figures, whether the application of a particular Model to calculate compensation is just and fair in the circumstances of the plaintiffs’ loss suffered by reason of the defendant’s breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">679 The defendant contended that if the Whole Portfolio Model is to be adopted, then the Court should prefer the evidence of Ms Mayr to that of Mr Morrey and also exclude the following investments from the assessment: (i) investments made under the discretionary mandates or by Mr Grotz; (ii) investments made in Russian securities beyond 2008; (iii) investments made in precious metals; (iv) investments made up to 5% of the ordinary share capital of Raptor; and (v) investments in hedge funds.

The Whole Portfolio Model is consistent with that alternative. It does not guarantee that “targets” are hit or positive returns are made. It simply places the whole portfolio in the constructed medium-risk portfolio with the indicia as identified to determine what would have been achieved but for the defendant’s breach. The purpose of the evidence from the wealth management experts was to determine the rate of return that an investment in a medium-risk portfolio would likely have achieved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">690  The Whole Portfolio Model does not rest on the premise that all the investments in the Trust accounts were “inappropriate”.

However, it is important to ensure that the reality of achieving appropriate investment returns in a portfolio as defined for the purpose of creating the “counterfactual” or the “parallel universe” in the quantification of loss is not constrained by timidity caused by these creations, but rather is undertaken with them in mind in a robust and careful analysis. The exclusion of bias and ensuring the loyal performance of the task of assisting the Court were essential features of the evidence of both Ms Mayr and Mr Morrey. On balance I found Mr Morrey’s approach compelling and preferred it to that of Ms Mayr. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">695 The approaches adopted by Mr Morrey to each of the matters in issue should be adopted for the relevant calculations by the forensic accountants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">696 It is necessary to recognise the concessions made by the plaintiffs that the other two investments, the GCF and the TBC Loan were his responsibility and not the responsibility of the defendant. He also accepted that the art collection investment was his responsibility. These investments were not included in the quantification under Whole Portfolio Model 1B because they were treated as capital payments out of the Trust.

</div> In the circumstances because the plaintiffs have experienced difficulties in extracting the balance of the Trust funds from the defendant, it is appropriate that compensation be payable by the defendant into a Trust Fund, the identity and location of which the plaintiffs are to notify the defendant forthwith. The defendant is to make payment of the amount of compensation into the Trust Fund as directed by the plaintiffs or their Trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">733 The parties are to prepare short minutes of order to reflect these findings together with agreed orders as to costs and any interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">734 If the parties are unable to reach agreement on costs and/or interest, they should file an agreed timetable for submissions on costs and/or interest by no later than 30 June 2023. If the parties agree, the question of costs and/or interest, will be dealt with on the papers. If the parties wish to have an oral hearing in respect of costs and/or interest, they should deal with this in the timetable.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Patricia Bergin<br/>International Judge</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cavinder Bull SC, Woo Shu Yan, Tan Yuan Kheng, Fiona Chew Yan Bei, Kelly Tseng Ai Lin, Gerald Paul Seah Yong Sing and Liang Fang Ling Elisabeth (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Eng Beng SC, Disa Sim and Torsten Cheong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) (instructed), Kenneth Lim Tao Chung, Mak Sushan Melissa, Afzal Ali, Wong Pei Ting, Yeow Yuet Cheong, Gan Yun Han Rebecca and Justin William Jeremiah (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The plaintiffs are the beneficiaries of the Mandalay Trust (the “Trust”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Credit Suisse Trust Limited (“the defendant”) is the defendant in the suit and Trustee of the Trust. The defendant is part of the Credit Suisse Group (“Credit Suisse”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the suit</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 In late 2004, the plaintiff was approached with a proposal that he place his funds with the defendant. At the time, the plaintiff and his business partner had just sold a metallurgical complex in Russia for approximately USD 1.6bn. It was ultimately agreed that the plaintiff would place over USD 1bn on trust with the defendant for the purpose of “Inheritance Planning and Asset Holding”.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 In 2005, various documents were executed for the setup of the Trust including the declaration of Trust (the “Trust Deed”). The plaintiff signed a letter of appointment in which he purported to reserve as a condition of transferring assets to the Trust, the right to choose (on a continuing basis): (a) the investment manager or advisor who shall be responsible for making decisions as to the assets of the trust; and/or (b) the investment thereof (the “2005 Letter of Appointment”). This letter recorded the plaintiff’s wish that he be appointed the initial investment manager to the Trust.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 A “Memorandum of Wishes Concerning the Mandalay Trust” was also signed by the defendant at the time the Trust Deed was signed. The purpose of the Memorandum of Wishes was to “record information to assist in the administration of the trust and the exercise of any discretion and powers pursuant to the trust deed”. It identified the plaintiff as “the principal beneficiary” and recorded that: “During his lifetime, the Trustee may have regard to his recommendations in respect of the investment of the Trust Fund, the beneficiaries of the Trust and any distributions to the beneficiaries”.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The Trust was initially set up with two underlying companies: Meadowsweet Assets Limited (“Meadowsweet”) and Soothsayer Limited (“Soothsayer”). These companies were held by nominees that were ultimately owned by the defendant. The defendant owned its shares in these companies in its capacity as trustee of the Trust. The corporate directors for these companies where wholly owned by the defendant. The individual directors of the corporate directors included persons who were also directors with the defendant. Later, in 2006, the Trust acquired a third company, Lynden Management Ltd.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Meadowsweet held accounts with Credit Suisse AG Geneva Branch (“the Bank”), which was part of the Credit Suisse Group (“Credit Suisse”). Soothsayer held accounts with the Singapore branch of the Bank (the “Singapore Bank”). In March 2005, USD 1.1bn was transferred by the plaintiff into the Meadowsweet accounts. Later that month, USD 550m was transferred from the Meadowsweet accounts to the Soothsayer accounts.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 From June 2006, the relationship manager (“RM”) of the Bank in respect of Meadowsweet’s accounts was Mr Patrice Lescaudron (“Mr Lescaudron”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Over the next 9 years, Mr Lescaudron fraudulently misappropriated many millions of dollars from the Trust. He embezzled sums of money, purchased securities at above market price, and transferred money between the plaintiffs’ accounts and those of other clients to camouflage his activities. He was subsequently convicted and imprisoned by the Swiss Correctional Court.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Mr Lescaudron made many unauthorised payments away or “UPAs” from the Trust. Credit Suisse defined a UPA as a payment from a Credit Suisse Trust structure for which Credit Suisse Trust’s prior approval was not obtained. From December 2006, employees of the defendant warned Mr Lescaudron that he was not to make payments without first obtaining the approval of the defendant. Despite these warnings, Mr Lescaudron continued to effect UPAs from the Trust accounts. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 In December 2006 a senior officer of the defendant warned colleagues of the dangers of such conduct which included the prospect of “employee fraud”.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 In March 2008, the defendant was aware of UPAs totalling EUR 10.272m and USD 7.731m from the Trust accounts. In November 2008, the defendant was aware of UPAs totalling EUR 5.729m and USD 4.396m from the Trust accounts. Despite the defendants’ repeated requests to Mr Lescaudron for documentation to verify these UPAs, such documentation was not provided. More than a year later, the defendant had not been able to resolve these UPAs.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Mr Lescaudron continued having access to the Trust assets until 2015 when his fraud was exposed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The admission</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 On the tenth day of trial, the defendant admitted that by 31 December 2008 it had acted in breach of its duty as trustee to safeguard the Trust assets. The defendant accepted that it ought to have, as at 31 December 2008, taken reasonable steps to address the issue of unauthorised transfers from Meadowsweets’ accounts, including directly contacting the plaintiff to verify the propriety of such transfers. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The defendant accepted that if direct enquiry had been made with the plaintiff on 31 December 2008, it would have led to a situation where Mr Lescaudron would have been removed permanently as RM. The defendant accepted that one alternative consequence was that the Trust assets would have been moved to another financial institution.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The defendant contended that notwithstanding its admission it is not liable to the plaintiffs for losses beyond the moneys misappropriated by Mr Lescaudron and is protected from liability by reason of the plaintiff acting as Investment Manager in a reserved powers trust.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The nature of a reserved powers trust, as propounded by the defendant, was one in which there was no room for the sharing of investment responsibilities between the trustee and the settlor or beneficiary. A trust arrangement is developed to fit the requirements of each beneficiary and the willingness of the trustee to take on the trustee responsibilities. The relevant legislation in Singapore recognises the possibility of a settlor or beneficiary having investment powers over some of the Trust assets, leaving the trustee with investment powers over the residuum: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[435]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[436]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 There was concurrent management of the Trust assets, part by the plaintiff and part by the defendant through Meadowsweet and Soothsayer with the Bank and the Singapore Bank. The protection in respect of the defendants’ liability as provided in the Trust Deed only applied to those assets that were being managed by the plaintiff: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[482]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[483]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[485]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 In all the circumstances and having regard to the events between late 2006 and March 2008 it was clear that by no later than March 2008 any individual or professional trustee acting honestly and in good faith in compliance with its duty to safeguard the Trust assets would have had no justification for continuing to allow Mr Lescaudron to have access to the Trust assets. The failure to preclude such access by no later than 30 March 2008 was a breach of the defendant’s duty to the plaintiffs to safeguard the Trust assets: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">522]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The losses that flowed from the defendant’s breach of trust were not limited to the funds that were stolen by Mr Lescaudron. The Trust assets, as a whole, were vulnerable to Mr Lescaudron’s fraudulent manipulation in support of the deceitful scheme that he had constructed and implemented. This manipulation included not only theft of funds but also the movement of funds into and out of investments to enable Mr Lescaudron to cover his tracks and losses to keep his scheme afloat and to earn him millions of dollars and/or euros in commissions. These so called ‘investments’ were the vehicles he used to achieve his fraudulent goals. These investments were sometimes unsuitable and at other times overconcentrated. However, but for those that were managed by the plaintiff, they were all part of Mr Lescaudron’s scheme. The fact that he was permitted to continue in his role was causative of the losses beyond the misappropriations suffered by the plaintiffs: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">542].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The consequence of the breach by the defendant in failing to safeguard the Trust assets as at 30 March 2008 was that it was liable to the plaintiffs for the difference between the value of the portfolio that was not affected by fraud and would have been managed by a professional, competent trustee and the value of the portfolio managed by the defendant: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[545]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 The defendant was not entitled to rely on the defence of contributory negligence. When a trustee fails to safeguard trust assets it is in breach of an equitable duty to the beneficiaries. The admitted breach and the breach found to have been committed as at 30 March 2008 were breaches of an equitable duty, not a duty of care in tort: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[563]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 The defendant was not entitled to be relieved of liability pursuant to s 60 of the Trustees Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed). Any trustee acting honestly and in good faith in compliance with its duty to safeguard the Trust assets, would have had no justification for continuing to allow Mr Lescaudron to have access to the Trust assets from 30 March 2008.The defendant’s conduct was not reasonable. It tolerated Mr Lescaudron’s flagrant breaches, preferring his importance in retaining the plaintiff as a client over compliance with its core obligation of keeping the Trust assets safe: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[573]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[575]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 In the circumstances, the appropriate model to quantify the plaintiffs’ losses was that which represented the position in which all assets were withdrawn from the Trust at the relevant date of breach and invested in a benchmark portfolio, the result of which investment at the end of the relevant period was compared with the portfolio in the defendant’s custody. Having regard to the plaintiff’s management of the investment in Russian shares and precious metals until 2008, the appropriate model was that which excluded such trading in Russian shares and precious metals up to 31 December 2008: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[596]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[597]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[690].</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
