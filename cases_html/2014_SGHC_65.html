        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There are three sets of proceedings stemming
                    from the purchase of Gleni International Hospital (“the Hospital”)
                    erected on No 2A Jalan Listik, Medan, Sumatera Utera, Indonesia
                    (“the Land”). The purchaser was Columbia Asia Healthcare Sdn Bhd
                    (“Columbia”). The vendors (“the Vendors”) were
                    Mr Edward Hong Hin Kit (“Edward Hong”), Mr Albert Hong
                    Hin Kay (“Albert Hong”) (collectively, “the Hongs”)
                    and Mr Boelio Muliadi (“Boelio Muliadi”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The purchase of the Hospital and the Land was
                    structured in the form of a share purchase. The Hospital and the Land were owned
                    by PT Nusautama Medicalindo (“PTNM”). PTNM was in turn
                    wholly-owned by Universal Medicare Pte Ltd (“UMPL”). The Vendors
                    held all the shares in UMPL. Columbia agreed to purchase 99% of the shares in
                    UMPL (“the Sale Shares”) from the Vendors pursuant to a share sale
                    agreement (“the SSA”) dated 24 December 2007. Columbia
                    subsequently acquired the remaining 1% of UMPL’s shares pursuant to an
                    option also dated 24 December 2007 (“the Call Option
                    Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the time of completion of the SSA, a
                    Singapore company, Medical Equipment Credit Pte Ltd (“MEC”), was
                    registered as the chargee of a charge on the title certificate to the Land
                    (“the MEC Charge”). MEC was owned by DVI Inc
                    (“DVI”), an American corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The three sets of proceedings are Suits No 861
                    and 862 of 2008 (“Suit 861” and “Suit 862”
                    respectively) and Suit No 964 of 2009 (“Suit 964”). They were
                    consolidated and heard together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suits 861 and 862</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Suits 861 and 862 were brought by Thermal
                    Industries &amp; Supplies (Pte) Ltd (“Thermal Industries”) and
                    Thermal International (S) Pte Ltd (“Thermal International”)
                    (collectively, “the Thermal Companies”) respectively against PTNM
                    on 19 November 2008. The Thermal Companies are Singapore companies involved
                    in the provision of medical supplies and equipment to hospitals and medical
                    facilities. The Thermal Companies are controlled by Edward Hong, who is a
                    director and substantial shareholder in both companies. These are a breakdown of
                    the claims made by the Thermal Companies in Suits 861 and 862:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     In Suit 861, Thermal Industries
                        claimed from PTNM the sums of S$262,934.48 and S$10,000. The former was the
                        balance of monies advanced by Thermal Industries as a loan to
                            PTNM;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and the latter
                        was for four second-hand servers sold by Thermal Industries to
                            PTNM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     In Suit 862, Thermal International claimed from
                        PTNM the sums of S$393,399.70, S$3,320 and US$9,763.00. The first was the
                        balance for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”) machine sold
                        by Thermal International to PTNM. The latter two were for various supplies
                        provided by Thermal International to PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       PTNM disputed these claims. Columbia applied
                    successfully to be joined as a defendant in Suits 861 and 862. Should PTNM be
                    found liable in Suits 861 and 862, PTNM and Columbia brought third-party
                    proceedings against the Hongs for indemnities provided by them as vendors under
                    the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In Suit 861, PTNM also counterclaimed against
                    Thermal Industries for damages to be assessed for the supply of allegedly
                    defective second-hand servers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In Suit 862, both PTNM and Columbia
                    counterclaimed against Thermal International the sum of S$144,046.03 as payment
                    mistakenly made by PTNM to Thermal International for a Philips angiography
                    machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 964</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Suit 964 was filed on 11 November 2009,
                    more than a year after Suits 861 and 862 were commenced. The plaintiffs,
                    Columbia and PTNM, claimed against the Hongs for alleged breaches of the SSA.
                    The claims in Suit 964 sought, amongst others:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     An order for damages to be assessed
                        for receiving an encumbered title to the Land because of the existence of
                        the MEC Charge and/or costs, including legal costs, of taking the necessary
                        measures to remove the MEC Charge on the Land so as to obtain a good and
                        marketable title to the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     A declaration that the Hongs are liable to indemnify
                        Columbia/PTNM for any claim by DVI in relation to the transfer of shares
                        held by DVI in PTNM (“the DVI Shares”) to Albert Hong,
                        including all costs of defending any such claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     A declaration that the Hongs are liable
                        to indemnify Columbia and/or PTNM in relation to actual and potential
                        liabilities as a result of the Vendors’ breaches of various warranties
                        given in the SSA (principally relating to the under-declaration and
                        under-payment of tax).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     An order for damages to be assessed for over-payment for the Sale
                        Shares and/or the diminution in value of PTNM and/or the Sale Shares as a
                        result of the inflation of PTNM’s 2007 revenue
                figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Hongs disputed the claims in Suit 964.
                    They also counterclaimed against both Columbia and PTNM damages for abuse of
                    process and conspiracy with the predominant purpose of injuring the Hongs, by
                    seeking to extort a favourable outcome in Suit 964 and Suits 861 and 862. The
                    damage allegedly suffered by the Hongs’ includes loss of business and
                    personal reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the outset, I should say that the statement
                    of claim in Suit 964 did not state why PTNM is a co-plaintiff with Columbia.
                    PTNM was not a party to the SSA. The warranties given by the Vendors under the
                    SSA were given to Columbia. Neither did the statement of claim assert any right
                    of PTNM to rely on the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002
                    Rev Ed) (“the CRTPA”) to enforce the terms of the SSA, unlike the
                    third-party claims made by PTNM (and Columbia) against the Hongs in
                    Suits 861 and 862. In those two suits, PTNM claimed that various warranties
                    given by the Vendors in the SSA purported to confer a benefit on it (PTNM), and
                    that it was entitled to enforce those warranties against the Hongs by virtue of
                    s 2 of the CRTPA. Coming back to Suit 964, PTNM’s only reliance on
                    the CRTPA was in para 22(b) of its defence to counterclaim. I do not think
                    such a plea is appropriate. It should be in the statement of claim. In any
                    event, I am not persuaded on the merits that PTNM is entitled to rely on the
                    CRTPA to enforce the warranties in the SSA. I will say more about this
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Accordingly, I am of the view that PTNM has
                    not been correctly included as a co-plaintiff in Suit 964. Neither is it
                    entitled to rely on the CRTPA to make a claim against the Hongs in Suits 861 and
                    862 for breaches of warranties. Henceforth, I shall refer only to Columbia as
                    the plaintiff in Suit 964 and Columbia as the defendant making a claim against
                    the Hongs in Suits 861 and 862.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Hongs argued that Columbia’s claims
                    were not made in good faith. They relied on the fact that Columbia’s claim
                    in Suit 964 was against only the Hongs, even though Boelio Muliadi was also a
                    named vendor in the SSA, and had also given the same warranties as the Hongs.
                    This argument is untenable. It is up to Columbia to decide who it wishes to sue.
                    The fact that it decided not to sue Boelio Muliadi was neutral. Indeed, one
                    might argue that it made sense not to sue Boelio Muliadi, as there is no
                    evidence as to whether he is likely to have assets in Singapore, as opposed to
                    the Hongs, who assert that they are “prominent Singaporeans with
                    substantial reputations in Singapore and internationally”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This brings me to the next point, which can be
                    dealt with quickly. I refer to the Hongs’ counterclaim in Suit 964 for
                    damages for abuse of process and conspiracy. I agree with Columbia that this
                    counterclaim is without legal basis. If Columbia’s claims in Suit 964 are
                    invalid, they will be dismissed. The claims cannot, in and of themselves, give
                    rise to the counterclaim brought by the Hongs. Otherwise, every claim will be
                    met by such a counterclaim. The absence of evidence and closing submissions from
                    the Hongs to support their counterclaim reinforces the point that the Hongs were
                    never serious about their counterclaim. It should never have been
                made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The main disputes between the parties lay in
                    the claims made in Suit 964. I will thus address the issues raised in that suit
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There are four main issues in Suit 964:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first main issue is whether the
                        Hongs were in breach of the terms of the SSA that the Land would be free
                        from encumbrances (on the date of completion of the SSA), and that Columbia
                        would have good and marketable title to the Land, because the MEC Charge
                        constituted an encumbrance on the Land (“the Encumbrance
                        Issue”). If so, the sub-issue is whether Columbia is estopped or
                        otherwise precluded from alleging this breach. If not, the consequential
                        issue is the relief which Columbia is entitled to.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second main issue is whether the
                        Hongs are liable under the SSA to indemnify Columbia against claims made by
                        DVI, in relation to the transfer of the DVI Shares to Albert Hong, including
                        costs of defending any such claim (“the DVI Issue”). If so,
                        the consequential issue is whether the court should grant a declaration to
                        that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third main issue is whether the Hongs have breached the SSA due to
                        PTNM’s alleged improper book-keeping, and under-declaration and
                        under-payment of tax (“the Tax Exposure Issue”). The sub-issue
                        is whether a provision of the SSA should be expunged or rectified. If not,
                        and if the Hongs are in breach of the SSA on the third main issue, the
                        consequential issue is the relief which Columbia is entitled
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     The fourth main
                        issue is whether the Hongs have breached the SSA by inflating revenue
                        figures because of under-declaration and under-payment of tax (“the
                        Inflated Revenue Issue”). If so, the consequential issue is the
                        relief which Columbia is entitled to. Columbia alleged that it had
                        determined the actual purchase price for the Sale Shares by applying
                        Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation
                        (“EBITDA”) with an appropriate multiplier. Hence Columbia
                        claimed a diminution of the actual purchase price based on a similar
                        formula.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties and witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Columbia is a Malaysia-based company in the
                    business of developing and operating medical facilities across Asia. Pursuant to
                    the SSA and the Call Option Agreement, Columbia acquired 100% of the issued
                    share capital of UMPL, a company incorporated in Singapore. PTNM is an
                    Indonesian company. Its primary asset is the Land and the Hospital in Medan, and
                    its primary business is the operation of the Hospital. I will first set out the
                    witnesses that were called to give evidence by the respective parties during the
                    trial. The following factual witnesses testified on behalf of Columbia during
                    the trial:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Rick Evans, the Chairman of the
                        Columbia group of companies, which Columbia and now PTNM are part of. Rick
                        Evans was the person chiefly representing Columbia in the negotiations
                        leading up to the SSA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Prem Abraham, the Chief Financial Officer (South East
                        Asia) of the Columbia group of companies, who gave evidence on
                        Columbia’s due diligence exercise and the financial aspects of the
                        share sale transaction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Alan Lim, a partner of a Malaysian law firm, Tengku
                        Mohamed &amp; Alan Lim (“TMAL”), who acted for Columbia during
                        negotiation of the SSA;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Two expert witnesses also gave evidence for
                    Columbia and PTNM, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Roy Tedja, a partner of an
                        Indonesian tax-consulting firm JL Tax &amp; Customs Advisory, who gave
                        expert evidence mainly in relation to PTNM’s alleged under-declaration
                        and under-payment of taxes and inflation of revenue; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     James Searby, Managing Director of the
                        Singapore office of FTI Consulting, an expert services firm specialising in
                        litigation support and valuation. He gave evidence on how the diminution in
                        the value of the Land and the Sale Shares ought to be
                    computed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Prior to the completion of the SSA, the shares
                    in UMPL were held by the Vendors in the following percentages: 12.5% by Edward
                    Hong, 70% by Albert Hong and 17.5% by Boelio Muliadi. Edward Hong is also a
                    managing director and substantial shareholder in both the Thermal Companies. The
                    following factual witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the Hongs and/or the
                    Thermal companies during the trial:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Edward Hong.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Eddie Foo, the General Manager of the
                        Thermal Companies who, as Edward Hong’s trusted advisor, was
                        intimately involved in the negotiations leading up to the
                    SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Michael Chow,
                        the Chairman of Valued Partners Limited (“Valued Partners”), a
                        mergers and acquisitions advisory practice. Michael Chow was an advisor to
                        Columbia in various hospital transactions over the years, but left Columbia
                        more than two years before the start of the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                        Michael Chow acted as an intermediary between the Hong brothers and Rick
                        Evans in the sale of UMPL’s shares, and was the first person to raise
                        the prospect of acquiring the Hospital to Rick Evans.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Michael O’Hanlon, the Chief
                        Executive Officer of DVI and the Chairman of MEC at the material time. DVI
                        was a company that provided loans to the global medical community. It
                        operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, MEC, in the Asia Pacific
                        region. MEC was the provider of certain loans which feature prominently in
                        Suits 861 and 862. DVI and MEC have since gone into liquidation. Counsel for
                        PTNM and Columbia, Mr Harish Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), chose
                        not to cross-examine Michael O’Hanlon and accepted his affidavit of
                        evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Hongs relied on two expert witnesses.
                    First, they called Nick Graham, a chartered accountant of RSM AAJ Associates.
                    Second, they sought to admit two affidavits by Tay Puay Cheng, an Executive
                    Director in the Forensic division, and Head of the Restructuring division of
                    KPMG Services Pte Ltd. Mr Kumar chose not to cross-examine Tay Puay Cheng.
                    Mr Kumar was prepared to accept Tay Puay Cheng’s affidavit of
                    evidence in chief, subject to the qualification that he (Mr Kumar) was of
                    the view that the evidence was irrelevant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> None of the parties gave much weight to Tay Puay
                    Cheng’s evidence in their submissions, so I will not refer to it
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I will go into some detail on the background
                    facts because of the many allegations made in the three actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The history of PTNM and the loans from MEC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     PTNM was set up in the early 1990s as a joint
                    venture between four parties: Gleneagles Development Pte Ltd
                    (“Gleneagles”), Albert Hong and two Indonesian business partners,
                    one of whom was Boelio Muliadi. In 1995, PTNM obtained a loan for US$25m
                    (“the Syndicated Loan”) from a banking syndicate headed by the
                    Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (“the Syndicated
                    Lenders”) for the construction of the Hospital. The Syndicated Loan was
                    guaranteed by the four shareholders of PTNM in the proportion of their
                    shareholdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Syndicated Lenders subsequently recalled
                    the loan. The shareholdings of the two Indonesian partners were confiscated by
                    the Syndicated Lenders because they were unable to pay their share of the loan.
                    At this juncture, Edward Hong saw an opportunity for the Hongs to take over the
                    entire business of the Hospital by repaying the balance of the Syndicated
                        Loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the course of the negotiations, the
                    Syndicated Lenders agreed to a payment of US$12m as a full and final settlement
                    of their claim. Gleneagles indicated that they would give up their shares in
                    PTNM if the Hongs could settle the entire loan. On 2 July 2002, UMPL
                    obtained a US$12m facility from MEC (“the MEC Loan”) to be applied
                    to the settlement of the Syndicated Loan. Pursuant to this arrangement, MEC
                    obtained the MEC Charge over the Land (the Land was owned by PTNM). MEC was
                    registered as a chargee of the Land on 1 September 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Hongs decided that UMPL would be the
                    vehicle to hold the shares in PTNM. However, 10% of the shares in PTNM were to
                    be held on trust for UMPL by an Indonesian company, in order to comply with
                    Indonesian law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> UMPL thus became the owner of 90% of
                    PTNM’s shares, and the beneficial owner of the remaining 10% of
                    PTNM’s shares. The shares of UMPL were in turn allocated between Albert
                    Hong, Edward Hong and Boelio Muliadi. Subsequently, 10% of the shares in UMPL
                    were re-allocated by Albert Hong to DVI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In addition to the US$12m facility used to
                    settle the Syndicated Loan, MEC also provided a loan of US$3m to Thermal
                    International for working capital. On 1 July 2002 Edward Hong requested MEC
                    to remit US$740,000 out of the US$3m loan directly to PTNM in order to alleviate
                    PTNM’s cash-flow at the time. Accordingly, US$740,000 was paid to PTNM out
                    of <em>Thermal International’s</em> loan from
                    MEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Thereafter, DVI and MEC went into liquidation.
                    Goldman Sachs (Asia) Finance (“GSAF”) bought over UMPL’s and
                    Thermal International’s debts to MEC on 20 September 2004.
                    MEC’s rights, title and interest under the MEC Loan and the US$3m loan
                    facility were assigned to GSAF. I will refer to the aggregate of the sums owed
                    by UMPL to GSAF under the assigned debt as the “Goldman Sachs
                    Indebtedness”. GSAF was supposed to become a chargee of the Land, but
                    GSAF was apparently not registered on the land title certificate as such. GSAF
                    also did not procure the removal of the MEC Charge at that time. MEC therefore
                    remained registered as a chargee of the Land, notwithstanding the assignment to
                    GSAF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In 2005, Edward Hong took control of the
                    running of the business from Boelio Muliadi, who had been running the Hospital
                    since the start of operations in 1997.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preliminary negotiations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     By 2007, the Hongs were looking to sell the
                    Hospital. Edward Hong was referred to Valued Partners, which was headed by
                    Michael Chow, with a view to finding a buyer for PTNM. Michael Chow contacted
                    Rick Evans who indicated his interest in purchasing the Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     According to Rick Evans, a meeting was
                    arranged between himself and Edward Hong in Kuala Lumpur either at the end of
                    September or the beginning of October 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Hongs
                    dispute the occurrence of this meeting. On 19 October 2007, Rick Evans,
                    accompanied by Michael Chow and Lucia Voon, a Columbia employee, made a visit to
                    the Hospital in Medan. There, Rick Evans met with Edward Hong and took a tour of
                    the facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Rick Evans’ evidence was that he was
                    given an information sheet on the Hospital either at the first meeting around
                    September 2007 or at the 19 October 2007 meeting. That sheet of paper
                    showed the operating cash flow of the Hospital for 9 or 10 months. Rick Evans
                    was able to infer from this that the Hospital would generate a positive annual
                    cash flow of about US$2.5m for 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The annual
                    cash flow was also referred to during the trial as the EBITDA of the business
                    for 2007. Rick Evans also claimed that he had made it clear to the Hongs that
                    any acquisition would be made on the basis that UMPL and PTNM were handed over
                    “clean”: with all current liabilities and current assets equalised
                    and all long-term debts retired at completion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Conversely,
                    the Hongs deny that any representation was made on cash flow at this point in
                        time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     According to Rick Evans, when Columbia
                    acquired hospitals, it typically determined the purchase price with reference to
                    the hospital’s annual cash flow or EBITDA multiplied by an appropriate
                    number, also known as the appropriate multiplier. After the 19 October 2007
                    meeting, Rick Evans said that he discussed the proposed purchase with Prem
                    Abraham. They agreed that 12 was an appropriate multiplier. The EBITDA of
                    US$2.5m and a multiplier of 12 yielded a figure of US$30m. Rick Evans thus
                    decided to make an offer of US$30m for the Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Hongs disputed that Columbia had based the
                    purchase price solely on the EBITDA and a multiplier. The Hongs asserted that
                    Columbia had based the purchase price entirely, if not at least partially, on
                    replacement costs (<em>ie</em>, the cost to replace the
                    assets of equal value). Further, the Hongs asserted that Rick Evans did not
                    communicate any basis for his initial offer of US$30m to Edward Hong, a point
                    which Rick Evans agreed with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On 22 October 2007 Rick Evans sent a
                    letter containing an initial conditional offer of US$30m to Edward Hong. The
                    letter indicated, amongst others, that “[a]ny and all debts, obligations
                    and/or other liens owed by UMPL and/or by [PTNM] [were] to be retired at
                        closing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Edward Hong replied on
                    23 October 2007 stating that he was comfortable with all the terms outlined
                    in the conditional offer, save for the price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On 26 October 2007, Eddie Foo sent an
                    email to Michael Chow with an attachment containing some financial information
                    about the Hospital. The attachment stated that the replacement cost of the
                    Hospital was US$57.7m (including the value of the Land), and that the EBITDA for
                    2007 was about US$2.5m. According to the attachment, this would have yielded a
                    multiplier of 12.8 based on a purchase price of US$32m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On 27 October 2007, Rick Evans, Edward
                    Hong and others met at Columbia’s facility in Puchong, Kuala Lumpur. Rick
                    Evans’ evidence was that at this meeting, he received an information
                    memorandum dated September 2007 (“the IM”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> There is some dispute as to the
                    actual date when Rick Evans received the IM. But this is not material, as it was
                    not disputed that he received it before the SSA was signed by him and the
                    Vendors. The IM projected PTNM’s EBITDA for 2007 at IDR 25,240,889,000 (or
                    approximately US$2.68m). Columbia’s case was that Prem Abraham had seen
                    and relied upon the IM to corroborate the represented cash flow of
                    US$2.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     During the meeting of 27 October 2007,
                    Columbia was asked to raise its initial offer. Rick Evans acceded and increased
                    Columbia’s offer to US$31m. Immediately after the meeting, Rick Evans sent
                    a second conditional offer to Edward Hong for US$31m, which was otherwise
                    identical in terms to the first conditional offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Edward Hong responded to the second
                    conditional offer with a letter dated 29 October 2007. In the letter,
                    Edward Hong asked for the due diligence and the finalisation of the sale and
                    purchase agreement to proceed simultaneously in order to accelerate completion.
                    This was, in effect, a tacit acceptance of Columbia’s offer of US$31m.
                    Rick Evans instructed Alan Lim to begin drafting the sale and purchase
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 6 November 2007, Eddie Foo sent an
                    email to Rick Evans, explaining the outstanding Goldman Sachs Indebtedness
                    reflected in PTNM’s accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Eddie Foo
                    explained that these moneys were originally borrowed by UMPL and Thermal
                    International respectively from DVI and on-lent to PTNM. He explained that these
                    debts had been subsequently sold by DVI to GSAF. He also mentioned that the
                    Vendors would liaise with GSAF such that all titles and securities would be
                    released free and unencumbered when settlement payments were made on
                    31 December 2007, which was the completion date the parties were aiming
                    for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Eddie Foo’s explanation to Rick Evans
                    was inaccurate in at least two respects. First, the loans were extended to UMPL
                    and Thermal International by MEC and not by DVI. Second, of the US$3m that
                    Thermal International had borrowed from MEC, only US$740,000 was actually
                    remitted to PTNM by MEC. Whether this remittance of US$740,000 made PTNM a
                    debtor of MEC, Thermal Industries or Thermal International is a matter of
                    considerable dispute, which I will elaborate on later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In mid-November 2007, Columbia’s due
                    diligence team headed by Prem Abraham visited the Medan Hospital to conduct the
                    due diligence exercise. The team looked primarily at PTNM and UMPL’s draft
                    unaudited accounts for 2007 and the audited accounts for 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    According to Prem Abraham, the team spoke primarily with Eddie Foo as well as
                    PTNM’s Financial Controller, K C Leong, and General Accounts Manager and
                    Senior Finance Manager, Kimun Kuara. After the due diligence was undertaken,
                    summaries and supporting documents were produced by Columbia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Correspondence was exchanged between the
                    parties in relation to this due diligence exercise. Eddie Foo’s letter of
                    26 November 2007 (mistakenly dated 26 November 2006), referred to the
                    Vendors settling the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness directly with GSAF with
                    “no further financial advantage or disadvantage to [Columbia] as the
                        Buyers.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the meantime, Alan Lim was working on a
                    draft of the sale and purchase agreement. A number of drafts were exchanged
                    between him and MKP, solicitors for the Vendors. Four drafts were prepared in
                    total, two of which passed between the solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On 29 November 2007, Eddie Foo sent an
                    email to Rick Evans with the subject “S&amp;P in Medan” which
                    brought up the following points:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     Albert Hong was proceeding to
                        acquire DVI’s 10% share in UMPL with the result that the Vendors in
                        the share sale agreement would be the Hong brothers and Boelio Muliadi. If
                        there was a claim by DVI in relation to its shares that were to be acquired
                        by Albert Hong, the Vendors would stand liable and this was to be included
                        in the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Vendors would, as a condition precedent, obtain GSAF’s agreement to
                        release all securities upon payment of the amounts owing to GSAF. It was
                        envisaged that the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness would be paid off and the
                        release of the securities obtained simultaneously with the completion of the
                        sale and purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Short-Form Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Between 30 November and 3 December
                    2007, Rick Evans paid a visit to Medan. This visit culminated in the Short-Form
                    Agreement (“the SFA”) dated 1 December 2007 signed by Edward
                    Hong on behalf of the Vendors and by Rick Evans on behalf of
                        Columbia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Prior to the SFA being signed, the parties had
                    reached an agreement to reduce the purchase price by US$341,000. This was
                    because Columbia had discovered that PTNM’s current liabilities exceeded
                    its current assets by US$841,000 according to management accounts and balance
                    sheet figures as at September 2007 which were provided on behalf of the
                        Vendors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    Columbia was of the view that the Vendors were obliged to bear this excess in
                    liabilities, in accordance with what had been agreed upon in negotiations. Rick
                    Evans nevertheless agreed that Columbia would be responsible for US$500,000 of
                    these liabilities, leaving the Vendors to bear the remaining
                US$341,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The apportionment of the US$841,000 was done
                    in the following manner. The purchase price for the Sale Shares (99% of the
                    Shares in UMPL) was reduced by US$841,000, from US$31m to US$30,159,000. The
                    US$500,000 which Columbia agreed to be responsible for became the purchase price
                    of Yayasan Gleni, a nursing academy, which was to be the subject of a separate
                    agreement. There was initially no separate agreement to purchase Yayasan
                    Gleni.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The SFA incorporated the abovementioned
                        arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The salient terms of the SFA
                    were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Columbia would acquire the Sale
                        Shares from the Vendors. Edward Hong would retain 1% of the shares in UMPL
                        and continue to serve as a commissioner and director of PTNM. He would grant
                        an exclusive option to Columbia to purchase his 1% share at a purchase price
                        of US$1,000 (pursuant to the Call Option Agreement).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     The purchase price for the Sale Shares
                        was to be US$30,159,000, which was to be paid in its equivalent in Singapore
                        dollars.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Vendors were to deliver both UMPL and PTNM free and clear of all liens,
                        debts and encumbrances. There were two exclusions in the case of PTNM: (1)
                        obligations to trade vendors and doctors that were part of the day to day
                        operations; and (2) debts owed to UMPL. The Vendors were not liable to
                        Columbia for these two categories of debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     Completion was targeted for 31 December
                        2007 with the possibility of an extension of up to a month for reasons
                        outside the control of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     Edward Hong was to sell to Columbia the entire interest
                        in Yayasan Gleni pursuant to a separate agreement, for a purchase price of
                        US$500,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     All
                        taxes payable to the Indonesian authorities for business operations of UMPL
                        and PTNM through 31 December 2007 were to be paid by the Vendors,
                        provided that this obligation would expire on 31 December
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Vendors
                        warranted that all the shares of UMPL were owned by them, and that all the
                        shares of PTNM were owned by UMPL (this included the 10% of PTNM’s
                        shares that were held by an Indonesian company on trust for
                    UMPL).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_h"></a>(h)     Columbia was
                        to complete all due diligence processes no later than 10 December
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_i"></a>(i)     Columbia
                        was to deliver a draft of a formal agreement incorporating the terms of the
                        SFA by 4 December 2007 and the parties were to make best efforts to
                        sign such an agreement by 7 December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_j"></a>(j)     Columbia had the option of assigning up to 35%
                        of the Sale Shares to an interested third-party investor, Kuwait Finance
                        House (M) Berhad (“KFH”) or one of its
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_k"></a>(k)     Columbia was to pay a deposit of US$1m upon the execution of the formal
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On 3 December 2007, Eddie Foo wrote to
                    GSAF offering S$25.5m in full settlement of the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness to be
                    paid on 31 December 2007, in accordance with a proposal made by GSAF on
                    7 May 2007. GSAF responded by email on 6 December 2007 stating that it
                    would accept S$25.5m in settlement provided the money was paid by
                    31 December 2007 and a settlement deed was executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The preparation and execution of the SSA </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     After the SFA was signed, Alan Lim
                    communicated with MKP about the draft formal agreement, that is, the SSA.
                    Eventually, the signing of the SSA was scheduled for 7 December 2007. On
                    7 December 2007, Michael Chow, Alan Lim, Rick Evans, Boelio Muliadi, Edward
                    Hong, Albert Hong and Eddie Foo attended a meeting in Singapore for the
                    finalisation and signing of the SSA by the Vendors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    There were discussions to finalise the terms of the SSA. Upon finalisation of
                    the terms, the SSA was engrossed and seven undated copies of it were signed off
                    by the Vendors and given to Alan Lim. Some of the terms in the SSA were not
                    identical to those in the SFA. This gave rise to some allegations by the Hongs
                    which I will elaborate on later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Under the SSA, the Vendors agreed to sell
                    99,000 shares comprising 99% of the issued share capital of UMPL to Columbia.
                    The purchase price was agreed to be US$30,159,000. At an agreed exchange rate of
                    US$1 to S$1.45, this worked out to S$43,730,550. This sum was apportioned as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$25.5m was to be paid by Columbia
                        directly to GSAF to discharge the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness;

                    four undated copies of the Call Option Agreement signed by Edward Hong. Under
                    this agreement, Edward Hong granted Columbia an option to acquire the remaining
                    1,000 shares in UMPL comprising 1% of UMPL’s issued share capital at the
                    purchase price of S$1,450.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The next day, a directors’ meeting of

                    (“the DVI Shares”) was cancelled and a new share certificate for a
                    corresponding number of shares was issued to Albert Hong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On 19 December 2007, Rick Evans informed
                    Edward Hong that he had signed the SSA and the Call Option Agreement on behalf
                    of Columbia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     A deed of settlement and discharge dated
                    21 December 2007 (“the Deed of Settlement”) was signed
                    between various parties including UMPL, Thermal International, Edward Hong,
                    Albert Hong and GSAF. Also, on 21 December 2007, Columbia gave instructions
                    to remit the deposit of S$1.45m under the SSA. The deposit was received by MKP
                    on or about 24 December 2007. The SSA and the Call Option Agreement were
                    both dated 24 December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The novation agreement(s)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Since PTNM was to be sold with its liabilities
                    (except for the excluded liabilities) discharged, there were discussions to
                    assign or novate any debts in PTNM’s books shown as owing to the Thermal
                    Companies. According to Rick Evans, the parties met at Albert Hong’s
                    office in Singapore on 31 December 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The Hongs
                    denied that any meeting took place that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Rick Evans’ evidence was that at the
                    alleged meeting of 31 December 2007 one of the items agreed on was that the
                    advances made by Thermal International to PTNM, as shown in PTNM’s balance
                    sheet for October 2007, were to be assigned to Columbia. This led to a novation
                    agreement in respect of certain debts owing by PTNM to Thermal International
                    being executed at completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     There was also some correspondence to the
                    effect that Columbia wanted a second novation agreement with respect to debts
                    owing by PTNM to Thermal Industries. However, only the novation agreement
                    involving Thermal International was eventually executed at completion (the
                    detailed facts involving these debts are discussed later below in relation to
                    Suit 861). Thermal Industries alleged that Edward Hong refused to sign the
                    novation agreement for the debts owed by PTNM to Thermal Industries because
                    these were trade debts and, hence, the Vendors were not obliged to discharge
                    them. Columbia was informed of this. Columbia did not dispute that they were
                    told about Edward Hong’s reason for not signing that novation agreement,
                    but Columbia’s position was that it never agreed with Edward Hong’s
                    reason. It was content to proceed without the second novation agreement and to
                    see how things developed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events leading up to completion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As 31 December 2007 approached, it was
                    agreed between the parties to the SSA that Columbia would pay S$26,974,858 to
                    MKP and that the latter would use that sum to settle the Goldman Sachs
                    Indebtedness. The sum of S$26,974,858 was Columbia’s 65% share of the
                    actual purchase price (that is, S$43,730,550 (see [53] above)) less the deposit
                    of S$1.45m already paid. It was not clear at that time whether KFH was
                    proceeding to take up 35% of the investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     MKP received the S$26,974,858 on
                    2 January 2008, and on 4 January 2008, MKP paid S$25.5m to GSAF. On
                    9 January 2008, Edward Hong wrote to Rick Evans by email asserting that
                    GSAF had already been paid from the money that Columbia had sent and that
                    s 3.4.2(b) of the SSA had been fulfilled, <em>ie</em>,
                    that “all the security documents [had been] fully and unconditionally

                    receipt of S$25.5m. MKP also forwarded a letter from GSAF’s solicitors,
                    Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (“A&amp;G”) dated 8 January 2008.
                    The letter from A&amp;G to MKP forwarded various documents pursuant to the Deed

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On 16 January 2008, Alan Lim responded to
                    MKP saying that he was unable to conclude that the documents enumerated in
                    A&amp;G’s letter of 8 January 2008 were in fact exhaustive, and that
                    Columbia’s Singapore solicitors, TSMP Law Corporation, had not been able
                    to complete the legal due diligence because documents were still outstanding.
                    Alan Lim further asked MKP to take note of s 3.4.2 of the SSA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This drew a lengthy written response from MKP
                    on 17 January 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The response referred to a
                    telephone conversation which Rick Evans had with Edward Hong, in which Rick
                    Evans told Edward Hong that KFH was not proceeding with the transaction, and
                    that Columbia would pay the balance of the actual purchase price. According to
                    MKP’s response, Rick Evans had informed Edward Hong during their
                    telephone conversation “that payment of the Balance Purchase Price would
                    be received in Singapore on 22 January 2008”. MKP’s response
                    also stated that Edward Hong had “agreed to this extended date for
                    payment, with the understanding that on receipt of the balance, the Vendors will
                    have access to the funds.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Rick Evans in his AEIC disputed the above
                    version of events. He asserted that while he had indicated that Columbia might
                    be able to complete by 22 January 2008, he had not made a firm commitment
                    to that date. In any case he had never agreed that the Vendors would have access
                    to the money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> On 17 January 2008, Alan Lim wrote
                    back to MKP stating that Columbia would pay the balance by 25 January 2008
                    and that all moneys paid were to be dealt with in accordance with s 3.4 of
                    the SSA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On 18 January 2008, MKP responded to
                    reiterate the Vendors’ position that Edward Hong had only agreed to
                    further extend the completion date past the already extended date of
                    18 January 2008 provided that the remaining 35% of the actual purchase
                    price would be received by the Vendors on or before 22 January 2008 and
                    that the SSA be varied to allow the Vendors to have access to this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On 20 January 2008, Rick Evans spoke with
                    Edward Hong and they agreed that they would complete on 22 January 2008.
                    Later that day, Alan Lim wrote to MKP setting out the arrangements upon
                    completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Alan Lim subsequently sent to MKP an amended
                    draft of the novation agreement for Thermal International, a draft of the
                    novation agreement for Thermal Industries and a draft of an agreement for the
                    purchase of Yayasan Gleni. I have referred to the intended novation agreements
                    earlier. The Yayasan Gleni agreement was duly executed on 22 January 2008
                    and the consideration of S$725,000 (being the equivalent of US$500,000) was
                    subsequently paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Completion under the SSA occurred on 22
                    January 2008 at MKP’s office. A bank draft for S$15,305,692 (being the
                    balance of the purchase price) was handed to MKP. In return, MKP handed over
                    certain documents, including the land title certificate for the Land.
                    MKP’s letter of 22 January 2008 also stated that the land title
                    certificate in PTNM’s name for the Land was “free from all and any
                    Encumbrances whatsoever”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>
                    However, it was later discovered that MEC’s name had not been removed (as
                    a chargee) from the land title certificate. Shortly after completion, Columbia
                    took over the management of the Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Post-completion events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Post-completion, MKP sent a number of emails
                    to Alan Lim. In these emails MKP sought confirmation that they could pay out the
                    balance of the money they were holding to the Vendors, on the basis that Rick
                    Evans had purportedly agreed with Edward Hong to vary the SSA to allow the
                    Vendors access to the funds. Columbia’s stance at that point was that they
                    had never agreed to a waiver of s 3.4 of the SSA (which provided for how
                    the purchase price was to be released). Nevertheless, preparations were made to
                    allow MKP to release to the Vendors 90% of the money currently held by them as a
                    gesture of goodwill. The 10% remainder was to be retained by MKP as stakeholder
                    until all the conditions in s 3.4 had been complied with.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>
                    This position was communicated to MKP in Alan Lim’s email to them dated
                    24 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On 29 January 2008, MKP wrote to Alan
                    Lim. The letter attached various forms that had been provided by GSAF’s
                    solicitors. MKP was of the understanding that those forms had to be filed in
                    Indonesia in order to obtain clean title to the Land. The executed documents
                    were eventually sent by MKP to Alan Lim’s office under the cover of their
                    letter of 14 February 2008. As it transpired, these documents proved
                    ineffective to remove the MEC Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     By a letter dated 31 January 2008, MKP
                    wrote to Alan Lim enclosing a letter of release signed by GSAF dated
                    21 January 2008. On the same day, MKP sent an email to Alan Lim asserting
                    that the Vendors had fully complied with the SSA and that they were entitled to
                    the rest of the moneys being retained by MKP. MKP specifically asserted that
                    “[i]n so far as section 3.4.1 and section 3.4.2(a) are concerned, the
                    Liabilities have been fully and finally settled and all security documents (of
                    the Company) have been fully and unconditionally discharged”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     On 1 February 2008, Alan Lim wrote to MKP
                    indicating that while the Vendors had not fully complied with s 3.4 of the
                    SSA, Rick Evans was agreeable to the “release of the 10% Balance Purchase
                    Price to the Vendors upon Mr Edward Hong’s undertaking to assist our
                    client to resolve all outstanding issues”. The email emphasised that this
                    was done “in the spirit of goodwill and good faith”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>
                    MKP wrote back on the same day to confirm Edward Hong’s undertaking and
                    that accordingly they would be releasing the remaining 10% of the money to the
                    Vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     On 27 February 2008, UMPL received a
                    letter from DVI’s solicitors, Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP (“Shook
                    Lin”). DVI’s assets were, at that point, under the control of a
                    liquidating trustee. Shook Lin’s letter asserted DVI’s claim to
                    10,000 shares in UMPL. On 7 March 2008, MKP wrote to Alan Lim stating that
                    his “clients shall deal with the purported claim of [DVI’s
                    liquidating trustee] with [Shook Lin] directly if the need
                        arises.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The liquidator of DVI eventually
                    brought legal proceedings against the Hongs and UMPL to enforce its rights, but
                    later discontinued the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     By a letter dated 16 May 2008, Alan Lim
                    sent a notice to MKP that Columbia intended to exercise its option under the
                    Call Option Agreement to purchase the 1,000 shares in UMPL held by Edward Hong.
                    Columbia accordingly paid S$5,800, and the last 1,000 shares in UMPL were
                    transferred to them in early July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In May 2008, there was communication between
                    Eddie Foo and Prem Abraham concerning debts that were allegedly due from PTNM to
                    Thermal International as a trade vendor, and which had not been assigned under
                    the novation agreement which Thermal International had signed. On 28 May
                    2008, PTNM made a payment of S$200,000 to Thermal International. I will
                    elaborate on this below as it features in Suit 862.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     A few months after completion, Columbia
                    discovered issues regarding what they alleged to be under-declaration and
                    under-payment of income tax by the Hospital in the past. Columbia was concerned,
                    in particular, about Article 21 withholding tax (“Art 21
                    WHT”). This was tax that the Hospital, as an employer, was obliged to
                    withhold from its employees (in this case doctors). The Hospital was then to pay
                    this withholding tax directly to the Indonesian Tax Authority (“the
                    ITA”) on behalf of its employees. Edward Hong claimed that he and Eddie
                    Foo met with Rick Evans in the middle of March 2008 to discuss these issues. In
                    his AEIC, Edward Hong stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Amongst the matters discussed at this meeting were the tax issues.
                            <b><em>We explained that consistent with what we were
                            advised as the industry practice, the withholding tax on doctors’
                            fees would be slightly under-declared so that the doctors would get more
                            fees as would the hospital.</em></b> We told them that as advised by
                        our Indonesian management team, this was common practice in the medical

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The position of Rick Evans and Columbia was that such a
                        meeting never occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     On 30 May 2008, Rick Evans met Edward
                    Hong for a lunch meeting in Singapore to discuss the tax issues. At this
                    meeting, Rick Evans indicated to Edward Hong that he was aware of the practice
                    of under-declaration and under-payment of Art 21 WHT in the Hospital and
                    that Columbia, now in control of the Hospital, intended to comply with
                    Indonesian law in the future and abandon the Hospital’s previous practice
                    in this regard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Following the lunch meeting, Edward Hong sent
                    an email to Rick Evans on 2 June 2008 where he stated that the past
                    practice in relation to the under-declaration and under-payment of
                    Art 21WHT (what he called “the old system”) had been in place
                    since the inception of the Hospital. Edward Hong further stated that PTNM had
                    not had trouble with the ITA. Referring to Rick Evans’ decision to comply
                    with Indonesian tax law, Edward Hong wrote that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On 11 June 2008, Rick Evans responded,
                    stating that the Vendors were bound by the SSA, and could not unilaterally
                    absolve themselves from any liabilities whether of UMPL or PTNM, if such
                    liabilities flowed from the failure in the past to observe or comply with the
                    relevant tax legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Subsequently, Columbia ran into difficulties
                    removing the MEC Charge (“the Land problem”). Alan Lim requested
                    help from the Hongs to resolve the problem. Emails were exchanged between the
                    parties on the resolution of the Land problem. Columbia also made various
                    allegations of improper book-keeping and potential tax liabilities incurred by
                    PTNM when under the management of the Hongs. The Hongs, on their part, continued
                    to demand payment for various sums allegedly owed by PTNM to the Thermal
                    Companies (these payments form the subject matter of Suits 861 and
                862).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     MKP’s letter dated 30 October 2008
                    to Alan Lim accused Columbia of raising various “non-issues”,
                    “to delay payment of the undisputed sums of S$669,654.28 and US$9762, due
                    and owing to [Thermal International] by PTNM”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> In
                    relation to the Land problem, MKP also stated that their clients, the Hongs,
                    found it “amusing that Columbia Asia has chosen, for their own improper
                    purpose, not to see through the scam for what it is – that those
                    Indonesian security-registering authorities just want their palms greased before
                    agreeing to the OBVIOUS.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> In respect of
                    the improper book-keeping and tax liabilities, MKP made the general assertion
                    that everything had been declared to Columbia and that it had been factored into
                    the price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     By an email dated 20 November 2008, MKP
                    wrote to Alan Lim to inform him that he had issued two writs against PTNM on
                    behalf of Thermal Industries and Thermal International. Those writs were Suits
                    861 and 862 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the meantime, Columbia continued to attempt
                    to seek the Hongs’ assistance to resolve the Land problem which Columbia
                    claimed was hampering its ability to obtain financing by using the Land as
                    collateral. MKP responded by way of a letter dated 3 December 2008 stating
                    that the Hongs had been advised that the resolution of the Land problem
                    “could have been accomplished within one week at an approximate cost of
                    the equivalent of US$1,000” and that they (the Hongs) were “ready,
                    willing and able to assist in the process. They always have.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On 6 March 2009, Rick Evans and Edward
                    Hong met in Singapore in an attempt to resolve the Land problem and the alleged
                    debts owed by PTNM to the Thermal Companies. Rick Evans claimed he told Edward
                    Hong that if the Land problem could be resolved, he would be prepared to discuss
                    the outstanding amounts claimed by the Thermal Companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    Edward Hong said that he would resolve the Land problem and have the MEC Charge
                    removed from the land title certificate by the end of the month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     An email was sent from Edward Hong to Rick
                    Evans on the same day (6 March 2009) purporting to summarise their
                        discussion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> According to that email, Rick Evans
                    had agreed, in exchange for the Hongs resolving the Land problem by the end of
                    the month, to pay “the full amount of the agreed outstanding trading debt
                    that still exists between our 2 companies, as claimed/documented, approximately
                    S$670K plus US$10K.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> In his
                    evidence, Rick Evans disagreed with this aspect of Edward Hong’s email,
                    contending that he had never agreed to pay the outstanding sums mentioned
                    therein. However, in Rick Evans’ reply to Edward Hong’s email, dated
                    11 March 2009, he did not dispute Edward Hong’s allegation that he
                    had agreed to pay the alleged outstanding trade debt in return for the removal
                    of the MEC Charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Despite Edward Hong’s personal efforts
                    after 6 March 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> he could not procure the removal of the
                    MEC Charge. Towards the tail end of his unsuccessful efforts, Edward Hong wrote
                    in an email dated 19 June 2009 that Columbia had not informed the Hongs
                    that “[GSAF] and [Columbia] had unsuccessfully endeavoured to have
                    MEC’s interest on the relevant title removed” when Columbia
                    encouraged the Hongs to commit to cleaning up the title of the Land.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>
                    Edward Hong’s email also alleged that their commitment to clean up the
                    land title was given on a “best endeavour” basis at a without
                    prejudice meeting on 6 March 2009. Nevertheless, he assured Columbia that
                    “we are advised by the various parties working on our behalf that we are
                    close to having the matter resolved by the first week of July
                    2009”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In a further email from Edward Hong dated
                    8 July 2009, Edward Hong reiterated that the 6 March 2009 meeting in
                    Singapore was a “without prejudice” meeting, and that he had
                    agreed to clean up the land title “as a good corporate
                        Samaritan”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Edward Hong further stated
                    that “I cannot assist you further with this Land issue and will allow the
                    matter to rest.” He ended his email by saying that the matter should be
                    between GSAF and Columbia as Columbia had paid the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness
                    and “in consideration for which [GSAF] were meant to deliver an
                    unencumbered title”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I pause here to mention that I have referred
                    to the 6 March 2009 meeting and the email sent by Edward Hong on
                    6 March 2009 in respect of that meeting, even though Edward Hong
                    subsequently alleged that the 6 March 2009 meeting was on a without
                    prejudice basis. I do not accept that that meeting was conducted on a without
                    prejudice basis. That allegation was made by Edward Hong too late in the day to
                    try and prevent Columbia from relying on the meeting. When he wrote on
                    6 March 2009 to refer to that meeting, he did not say it was on a without
                    prejudice basis. He only alleged that the meeting was on a without prejudice
                    basis for the first time in his email dated 19 June 2009, when he had
                    encountered difficulties in removing the MEC Charge. In any event, the closing
                    submission for the Hongs for Suit 964 relied on that meeting in respect of the
                    Inflated Revenue Issue. Therefore, the Hongs have waived disclosure of the
                    substance of the meeting even if it had been conducted on a without prejudice
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Rick Evans replied to Edward Hong on
                    13 July 2009 stating that he had been closely following the Hongs’
                    efforts to deliver a clean land title and that his previous statements that the
                    Land problem would be easy to resolve had been unrealistic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Rick Evans also emphasised that
                    the Vendors had an obligation to deliver the Land free of all encumbrances and
                    that they had, to date, failed to discharge this obligation. He also said that
                    an unsuccessful attempt by GSAF to transfer the security interest in the Land to
                    themselves between 2005 and 2006 had never been disclosed to Columbia by the
                    Vendors. Rick Evans stated that Edward Hong’s assertions with respect to
                    “a best endeavour commitment” and on a “without prejudice
                    basis” were imagined and he enjoined the Hongs to resolve the Land
                        problem.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On 11 November 2009, Columbia instituted
                    Suit 964 against the Hongs. Further efforts were taken by Columbia and/or PTNM
                    to resolve the Land problem, but they proved futile until on or about
                    15 October 2012 when the MEC Charge was finally removed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>

                    2002, UMPL obtained the MEC Loan for US$12m from MEC which was secured by the
                    MEC Charge, which was accordingly reflected in the land title certificate. Under
                    an agreement dated 30 September 2004, MEC’s rights, title and
                    interest under the MEC Loan were assigned to GSAF. However, GSAF was unable to
                    register a security interest in its own name with the Medan Land Office. Neither
                    did it obtain the removal of the MEC Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The MEC Loan formed part of the Goldman Sachs
                    Indebtedness as defined in s 2.1.15 of the SSA. Columbia paid the sum of
                    S$26,974,858, which included the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness of S$25.5m to MKP as
                    stakeholders on 2 January 2008. MKP in turn paid S$25.5m to discharge the
                    Goldman Sachs Indebtedness on or about 4 January 2008. Upon receiving
                    payment, Goldman Sachs signed and issued a Form of Release dated 21 January
                    2008, purporting to release a security interest over the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     On 19 March 2009, PTNM applied to the
                    Medan Land Office for the removal of the MEC Charge from the land title
                    certificate. PTNM was informed by the Medan Land Office on 6 April 2009
                    that MEC remained registered as the security interest holder and that, in the
                    circumstances, GSAF was not in a position to grant a release of the security
                        interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the form of release
                    signed by GSAF was rejected by the Medan Land Office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The MEC Charge remained on the land title
                    certificate until on or about 15 October 2012, after the first tranche of
                    this trial, when efforts in removing it were finally successful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Hongs are liable under the SSA for failing to deliver the
                Land free of encumbrances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The SSA laid out a number of obligations on
                    the Vendors regarding title to the Hospital and the Land, including:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     The obligation to forward the
                        completion documents to Columbia (s 7.1.1.1 of the SSA). The completion
                        documents included “the original title deed to the Hospital in the
                        name of [PTNM] free from all and any Encumbrances whatsoever”
                        (s 2.1.9.1 of the SSA).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Hospital and the Land were warranted to be
                        “free from all and any Encumbrances” (s 9.1.1.2 of the
                        SSA).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_c"></a>(c)     PTNM was
                        warranted to have “good and marketable title” to the whole of
                        the Land (s 26.2.1 of the Third Schedule to the
                SSA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    “Encumbrance” was defined in
                    s 2.1.12 of the SSA as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Encumbrance</u> includes any interest or equity
                        of any person (including any right to acquire, option, pre-emption right or
                        right of first refusal) or any debenture, mortgage, charge, pledge, lien,
                        assignment, hypothecation, security interest, title retention or any other
                        security agreement or arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Columbia’s case was that the Hongs
                    were in breach of the above terms. They had failed to deliver the original title
                    deed to the Land free of encumbrances, as the MEC Charge had not been
                        removed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Hongs’ defence was two-fold.
                    First, that the MEC Charge was not an “encumbrance” because there
                    was no debt underlying it; the MEC Charge was, at most, an administrative
                    oversight. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Second, that Columbia had
                    waived its rights, or was estopped from alleging that the existence of the MEC
                    Charge on the land title certificate was a breach of warranty. This was due to
                    the fact that Columbia affirmed and completed the SSA despite having had full
                    knowledge of the MEC Charge on the land title certificate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether the MEC Charge was an “encumbrance”
                under the SSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The MEC Charge clearly fell within the
                    definition of “encumbrance” on a plain reading of s 2.1.12 of
                    the SSA. The fact that the debt that the MEC Charge was meant to secure had been
                    paid off did not make it any less a charge that remained on the land title
                    certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The existence of an encumbrance is not to be
                    confused with the quantum of the debt secured by the encumbrance. Hence, the
                    existence of an encumbrance does not vary depending on whether it secures a
                    large debt, a small debt, or no debt at all. The existence of an encumbrance is
                    also not to be confused with the ease or difficulty of removing the
                    encumbrance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The argument for the Hongs that no one else
                    could claim under the MEC Charge because the debt has been paid was irrelevant
                    to the Encumbrance Issue. It was a disingenuous argument which reflected their
                    desperate situation. Absurd results would follow if it were
                correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    It would mean that if there was a GSAF
                    charge registered on the land title certificate, all that the Hongs would have
                    had to do under the SSA was to discharge the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness. They
                    would not have had to remove the GSAF charge, as the latter too would not
                    constitute an encumbrance once the underlying debt was paid off. The
                    unsustainability of the argument is obvious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Hongs cited a Court of Appeal authority,
                        <em>Huang Ching Hwee v Heng Kay Pah and Anor</em>
                    [1992] 3 SLR(R) 452 (“<em>Huang Ching
                    Hwee</em>”), for the proposition that “the continued entry
                    of MEC’s name on the register was not a defect of title ... because
                    neither MEC nor any other third party had any subsisting rights over the
                        Land”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. In my view, this
                    case is irrelevant in the present context. In <em>Huang Ching
                        Hwee</em>, the court considered whether there was an implied term
                    under a contract for sale of land that the vendor has a duty to disclose latent
                    defects of title. The court there held that a potential statutory liability (in
                    contrast to one where notice had already been issued by the relevant authority)
                    arising from unauthorised alterations to the property was not a defect of title.
                    The issue in the present proceedings is a different one altogether. There was
                    nothing in that case suggesting that the MEC Charge was not an encumbrance. In
                    any event the definition of “Encumbrance” in the SSA is clearly
                    against the Hongs. The MEC Charge was an encumbrance whether or not it was
                    disclosed to Columbia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Furthermore, I reiterate that even in Edward
                    Hong’s own email dated 8 July 2009, he had said that the issue of the
                    MEC Charge should be between GSAF and Columbia (see [91] above). The reason was
                    that Columbia had already paid off the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness, in return for
                    which GSAF was meant to deliver “an unencumbered title”. Edward
                    Hong’s reference to “an unencumbered title” demonstrated
                    that the Hongs knew all along that the MEC Charge was an encumbrance.
                    Consequently, they must have known that it was their obligation to procure the
                    removal of the MEC Charge but chose to contend otherwise when it suited
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    It follows that any suggestion by MKP in
                    communication with Alan Lim that the Hongs had done all that they were obliged
                    to do under the SSA in respect of the Land was just wishful
                thinking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the MEC Charge resulted in PTNM not possessing
                “good and marketable title” to the Land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I proceed now to examine whether the
                    existence of the MEC Charge resulted in a breach of the warranty that PTNM had
                    “good and marketable title” to the Land. This point was not
                    addressed specifically by the Hongs’ defence. I will deal with it
                    quickly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I find the remarks on this point in
                        <em>Sinclair on Warranties and Indemnities on Share and Asset
                        Sales</em> (Robert Thompson gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed,
                    2011) at para 6-14 instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A vendor of land will be expected to show good title. He must prove that
                        he is entitled to and is selling the legal estate in the land for the
                        appropriate tenure... free from encumbrances or defects which will or may
                        impact the use and enjoyment of the property for the purpose for which it is
                        intended to be used save as is otherwise provided of disclosed...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The inclusion of the words “and
                            marketable” involves a separate requirement, by implying that
                            there is an absence of other factors relating to the property, either
                            rendering it commercially unsaleable or impairing its
                            saleability.</em></b> The limited nature of the requirement to show
                        good title is thus opened up to general aspects of marketability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    It can be seen that the requirement of
                    “marketability” is an additional requirement. In my view, the
                    saleability of the Land was impaired so long as the MEC Charge remained. Buyers
                    would obviously require and assume that the MEC Charge would be removed, just as
                    Columbia did. As an aside, it remains a mystery to me why GSAF acquired
                    MEC’s rights under the MEC loan and the US$3m loan facility without
                    ensuring that the MEC Charge was removed. The terms of GSAF’s acquisition
                    were not made known to the court. Also, the non-removal may have been due to an
                    omission on someone’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Accordingly, I find that the Hongs are in
                    breach of their obligations under the SSA to deliver the original title deed to
                    the Land and the Hospital free from encumbrances, and to deliver good and
                    marketable title to the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether Columbia has waived or was estopped from relying on
                the Hongs’ breaches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I turn now to the Hongs’ contention
                    that Columbia had waived the obligation to deliver the land title certificate to
                    the Land free from encumbrances, or that they were estopped from insisting on
                    the performance of this obligation. The Hongs relied on the completion under the
                    SSA and the release of the entire purchase price to support their
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    I have set out above (at [73], [75] and
                    [76]) in detail the circumstances as to how the completion and the eventual
                    release of the entire purchase price came about. It is obvious that Columbia did
                    not waive the relevant requirement. Neither did Columbia make any representation
                    which would have caused the Hongs to believe that Columbia would not rely on the
                    relevant requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    I recognise that neither Rick Evans nor Alan
                    Lim mentioned specifically at either the time of completion or the release of
                    the entire purchase price that the MEC Charge was still to be removed. However,
                    it is clear from the communication set out above that neither had agreed that
                    the Hongs had done all that they were required to do. Indeed, as stated at [76]
                    above, when Alan Lim wrote to MKP on 1 February 2008, he made it clear that
                    the Hongs had not fully complied with s 3.4 of the SSA, and that Rick Evans
                    was agreeable to releasing the last 10% of the actual purchase price only on
                    Edward Hong’s undertaking to assist in resolving all outstanding
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Columbia had taken things for granted. It
                    had assumed, wrongly, that there would be no difficulty in getting the MEC
                    Charge removed. On that basis, it was agreeable to the completion and the
                    release of the entire purchase price. However, I do not accept that Edward
                    Hongs’ undertaking (given through MKP’s email of 1 February
                    2008 (see [76] above) to assist Columbia to resolve all outstanding issues was
                    given gratuitously, as was suggested in their closing submissions. Nor do I
                    accept that the Hongs were only obliged to use their best endeavours to get the
                    MEC Charge removed, as Edward Hong had belatedly suggested in his email of
                    19 June 2009 (see [90] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Accordingly, I find that Columbia did not
                    waive nor was it estopped from relying on the Hongs’ breaches of their
                    obligations under:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_a"></a>(a)     s 7.1.1.1 of the SSA to
                        transfer the Land and the original title deed to the Hospital free from all
                        encumbrances;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_b"></a>(b)     s 9.1.1.2 of the SSA that the Hospital and the Land would be free from
                        all encumbrances at the Completion Date; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_c"></a>(c)     s 26.2.1 of the Third Schedule to the SSA
                        that PTNM had “good and marketable
                title”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate measure of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Columbia sought two forms of relief. The
                    first was for damages to be assessed for “the diminution in value of
                    [PTNM] and/or the Sale Shares and/or receiving title to the Land that is
                    encumbered”. The second was for an indemnity for “[c]osts,
                    including legal costs, of taking the necessary measures to remove the
                    Encumbrance on the Land so as to obtain a good and marketable title to the
                    Land”. The first was a claim for the diminution in value of the Sale
                    Shares. The second was for the costs of cure: the moneys expended in removing
                    the MEC Charge from the Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Columbia alleged that PTNM incurred costs,
                    including legal costs, to remove the MEC Charge from the land title in the sum
                    of US$391,251. Subsequently, in a chambers hearing on 6 February 2013, Mr
                    Kumar, counsel for Columbia, indicated that the claim for costs incurred to
                    remove the MEC Charge was an alternative claim to that for damages for receiving
                    an encumbered title. Clearly, the measure of damages must be calculated
                        <em>either</em> on the basis of the costs of cure
                        <em>or</em> the diminution in value, and the plaintiffs

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In closing submissions, Mr Kumar argued that
                    the more appropriate measure of damages would be the diminution in the value of
                    the Sale Shares. The argument was that the MEC Charge would have decreased the
                    value of the Land. This reduction in value of the Land, one of PTNM’s main
                    assets, would, in turn, have led to a diminution in value in UMPL’s
                    shares. It is not surprising that Columbia attempted to quantify its damages in
                    this manner. Columbia’s expert, James Searby, had filed a report assessing
                    such a diminution in value at S$1.52m. This amount far exceeds the costs of
                    cure, which Columbia alleged was US$391,251.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Columbia submitted that s 8.4.2 of the
                    SSA stipulated that the diminution in value was the appropriate measure of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the circumstances, Columbia submitted that the appropriate

                        saleable asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In support of its contention, Columbia cited
                    the following passage from Harvey McGregor, Martin Spencer &amp; Julian Picton,
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        18th<sup> </sup>Ed, 2012) (“<em>McGregor</em>”) at para 22-026 for the general position at
                    law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the claimant has entered into possession and then a defect is
                        discovered, it may be that there is little or no chance that he will be
                        evicted in the case of a superior title or that his enjoyment of the
                        premises will be interfered with in the case of an incumbrance. In such
                        circumstances it is arguable that the damages should be nominal, on the
                        ground that until eviction or other interference the injury is merely
                        hypothetical. Against this it may be said with force that the covenant for
                        good right to convey would thus be watered down to one for quiet enjoyment
                        and that, to avoid this, the claimant should get full damages here and now.
                        It is suggested that a middle course is the correct one. <b><em>The claimant should be able to recover damages representing the
                            diminution in the value of the property as a saleable asset by reason of
                            the possibility of interference, and the more remote the possibility the
                            less will the selling value be diminished.</em></b> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Columbia submitted that an appropriate
                    measure of the diminution in value in the present case is the difference in
                    value between the Land free from all encumbrances and the Land encumbered with a
                    charge of uncertain duration. Columbia pointed to the fact that it took Columbia
                    some four years and nine months to procure the discharge of the MEC Charge to
                    support its assertion that the MEC Charge was, at the time of completion, a
                    charge encumbering the Land for an <em>uncertain
                        duration</em>. Columbia also cited the case of <em>Watts v Marrow</em> [1991] 1 WLR 1421, a decision concerning a
                    negligent building survey, for the proposition that the correct measure of
                    damages in cases where the claimant would <em>not</em> have
                    acquired the property in question had it known of the defects is the diminution
                    in value of the property and not the costs of cure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    James Searby’s report analysed the
                    difference in value between the Land free from encumbrances, and the Land
                    encumbered by “a charge of an uncertain duration”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> According
                    to James Searby, the best measure of this would be the effect on the <em>marketability</em> of the Land of an encumbrance of uncertain
                        duration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> James Searby considered it
                    appropriate to use what he termed the “transaction-based”
                    approach, which compared the market value of a marketable asset to the observed
                    value of a similar, non-marketable asset.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> James
                    Searby then went on to examine a range of studies known as “restricted
                    stock studies” comparing trading prices of restricted stock in public
                    company shares with contemporaneous prices for identical (but unrestricted)
                    stock in public markets. James Searby noted that post-1990 restricted stock
                    studies indicated discount rates of between 9% and 22%. He also cited two
                    studies which used regression analysis on restricted stocks to try to isolate
                    the discount for lack of marketability from other factors, which indicated
                    discounts in a range of between 7.23% and 13.5%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Based on
                    the preceding figures, James Searby concluded that a reasonable discount for the
                    lack of marketability in the present case would lie between 10% and
                        20%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> Assuming the value of the Land to be US$7m,
                    which was the value put on the Land by Eddie Foo on 25 October 2007, James
                    Searby estimated that an appropriate discount for the encumbered land should
                    have been US$1.05m or S$1.52m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I am not convinced by the arguments put
                    forth by Columbia on this particular point. I am of the view that a more
                    appropriate measure of damages is the costs of cure. My reasons are as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    I do not accept the argument that the MEC
                    charge was of uncertain duration and that the damage caused by the encumbrance
                    ought to be considered as at the time of completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I make two observations. First, at the time
                    of completion, neither side believed that there would be any difficulty in
                    removing the MEC Charge. Aside from their beliefs, it is undisputed that the
                    underlying debt had been paid off. It should not have been difficult to have the
                    MEC Charge removed. The uncertainty or difficulty in removing the MEC Charge was
                    known to the parties only after completion. It is therefore inappropriate to say
                    that at the time of completion, the MEC Charge was for an uncertain duration.
                    Second, Columbia appeared to be suggesting that this court should not take into
                    account developments after completion. I do not agree with that suggestion. If
                    Columbia was right, it would still be entitled to full damages even if the MEC
                    Charge was removed one day or one week after completion. Such a suggestion is
                    unjust and preposterous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I do not accept that s 8.4.2 of the SSA
                    is applicable. That provision applies only if the value of PTNM or the Sale
                    Shares is permanently affected, which is not the case here, since the MEC Charge
                    has been removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I note <em>McGregor</em> suggests that the appropriate measure of damages for
                    defective title is the diminution in the value of the property as a saleable
                    asset by reason of the possibility of interference. <em>McGregor</em> refers to <em>Turner v Moon</em>
                    [1901] 2 Ch 825 (“<em>Turner”</em>) for this
                    suggestion. In that case, the buyer discovered the existence of a right of way
                    over a property after he had already bought it. In the buyer’s action for
                    breach of an implied covenant of title, it was held that the proper measure of
                    damages was “the difference between the value of the property as
                    purported to be conveyed, and that which the vendor had power to convey”.
                    There is therefore a material difference between the facts of <em>Turner</em> and of the present case. In the present case, the MEC
                    Charge was expected to be removed and although it took a much longer time and
                    much more effort to do so, the MEC Charge has been removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    James Searby’s report was also made on
                    the premise that the non-marketability of title may have been permanent. In
                    other words, it was based on an assessment of probabilities of various outcomes
                    at the time of completion. But it is illogical for this court to make an
                    assessment of damages based on probable outcomes, when one of the outcomes has
                    already materialised. James Searby’s report must surely be affected by the
                    fact that the MEC Charge was subsequently removed on 15 October 2012. With the
                    benefit of this knowledge, it appears to me to be inappropriate to continue to
                    characterise the MEC Charge as a “charge of uncertain duration”.
                    As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Metalform Asia</em>
                    at [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The measure of damages must be calculated either on the basis of
                        “the costs of cure” or “loss of bargain” and
                            <b><em>which one is applicable depends on the circumstances
                            of the individual case.</em></b> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    It is clear to me that the appropriate
                    measure of damages is the costs of cure. However, the information that the MEC
                    Charge was finally removed and the alleged costs of cure were provided in the
                    midst of the trial. Therefore, I ordered a bifurcation of the assessment of the
                    costs of cure on 20 February 2013 in order not to delay the completion of
                    the trial. If the Hongs lost on the Encumbrance Issue, there would be a separate
                    assessment for the costs of cure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: the DVI Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of relevant facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    DVI previously owned 10,000 shares in UMPL.
                    According to the Hongs, when DVI went into liquidation in the USA, the
                    Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware issued a “Notice of Sale by
                    De Minimis Shares of Stock” on 10 September 2004 stating that the
                    10,000 DVI shares were available for purchase for US$1,000. Albert Hong
                    responded through his then solicitors, Wee Swee Teow &amp; Co, claiming that as
                    an existing shareholder in UMPL, he had a pre-emption right to acquire those
                    shares under Article 29 of UMPL’s Articles of Association. Albert Hong
                    allegedly exercised his right of pre-emption to purchase the shares for US$1,000
                    (although arguably by then DVI had withdrawn the offer to sell these
                        shares).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    At a directors’ meeting of UMPL held
                    on 14 December 2007, it was resolved that “pursuant to [Article] 33,
                    on receipt of US$1,000.00 from Albert Hong, for the DVI shares, the Company do
                    and hereby cancel the DVI shares and that Mr Albert Hong be registered as the
                    shareholder of the 10,000 shares.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Albert
                    Hong accordingly purported to pay to UMPL US$1,000 to be held on trust for
                    DVI’s liquidating trustee in order to cancel the DVI shares and obtain the
                    issuance of an equivalent number of shares in his name. The 10,000 shares then
                    formed part of the Sale Shares sold to Columbia under the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    As noted above (at [77]), the liquidating
                    trustee of DVI subsequently brought a claim against the Hongs, UMPL and Columbia
                    in relation to these 10,000 shares in Suit No 61 of 2012. The claim was
                    discontinued without prejudice to DVI bringing a fresh action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Hongs are liable under the SSA to indemnify Columbia
                against any third-party claims relating to the Sale Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Under s 9.1.1.2 of the SSA, the Hongs
                    warranted that they have ownership of and title to the Sale Shares at the
                    completion date, and that the Sale Shares would be transferred to Columbia free
                    from all encumbrances. Under s 9.1.1.10 of the SSA, the Hongs warranted
                    that the Sale Shares were duly authorised and validly issued and allotted. On
                    that basis, Columbia sought an indemnity from the Hongs under s 8.4.2 of
                    the SSA for any loss it may suffer in relation to any claim by DVI, including
                    the costs of defending any such claim. Section 8.4 of the SSA obliged the
                    Hongs to hold Columbia harmless from all suits, proceedings and judgments
                    suffered by Columbia as a result of any breaches of the warranties given by the
                    Vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The Hongs had previously accepted that they
                    would have the responsibility of dealing with any claim from DVI’s
                    liquidating trustee. As stated above (at [77]), in a letter from MKP to Alan Lim
                    dated 7 March 2008, MKP reassured Alan Lim that “[o]ur clients shall

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether declaratory relief should be granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Hongs argued that declaratory relief
                    should not be granted. They stated that there was no reasonable prospect of any
                    further claim being brought by DVI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The power of the court to grant a
                    declaration is found in s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap
                    322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) read with para 14 of the First
                    Schedule to the SCJA and O 15 r 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed). The court’s power to grant a declaration is discretionary,
                    but it will be exercised if it is necessary to establish the plaintiffs’
                    rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The test for declaratory relief was
                    elucidated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v

                                doubts to rest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The Hongs argued that there was no evidence
                    to show that a further claim was likely to be brought by DVI, which has been in
                    liquidation since November 2004. The Hongs claimed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key issue is to determine if there is any <b><em>real or
                            distinct possibility</em></b> of the liquidating trustee of DVI
                        bringing any action for recovery of the shares <b><em>and their
                            prospect of success</em></b> of such a claim. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was unclear where this test was derived from. The Hongs
                        appeared to be relying on the <em>Karaha Bodas</em>
                        requirement of “real controversy” as the basis of their
                        argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    As noted in the closing reply submissions
                    for Columbia:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendants’ statement of the issue is wrong. The real point is
                        that <b><em>the defendants deny that they are obliged under the
                            SSA to indemnify [Columbia] against any claim by DVI in relation to the
                            transfer of the DVI Shares</em></b>, including all costs of defending
                        any claim that DVI may bring against it ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I agree that the “real
                    controversy” is not whether DVI is likely to bring a claim. It is whether
                    the Hongs are obliged under s 8.4.2 of the SSA to indemnify Columbia
                    against “[a]ny claim in relation to the transfer of the DVI Shares,
                    including all costs of defending any claim that DVI may bring against
                    it”. Furthermore, this is not a situation where DVI is precluded as a
                    matter of law from bringing a claim. What the Hongs are saying is that there
                    will not be such a claim in the circumstances because the liquidation of DVI has
                    already been ongoing for several years, and an earlier action by DVI has been
                    discontinued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    However, in my view, such allegations are
                    neither here nor there. There was no ruling on the merits of DVI’s claim.
                    The Hongs did not assert that DVI is precluded as a matter of law from
                    initiating another action for the DVI Shares. The Hongs merely say that any such
                    claim will not be successful on the merits but, again, they must know that that
                    is not the point. Columbia is entitled to an indemnity in case any such claim,
                    if and when it is made, is successful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    If the Hongs had simply admitted that they
                    were obliged to indemnify Columbia under the SSA for any such claim if and when
                    it arises, there would have been no need for Columbia to seek such a declaration
                    in the first place. However, given the Hongs’ stance on this matter, I am
                    of the view that this remedy is justified in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: the Tax Exposure Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The third main issue relates to whether the
                    Vendors were in breach of a number of tax warranties given in the SSA. There is
                    a certain degree of overlap—both legally and factually—between this
                    issue and the fourth main issue (the Inflated Revenue Issue), which relates to
                    the Vendors’ alleged breaches of warranties in the SSA relating to the
                    accuracy of PTNM’s books. For the sake of clarity I will first set out the
                    questions raised by each of these issues, and how they relate to each
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In relation to the third main issue,
                    Columbia alleged that PTNM had been under-declaring and under-paying value-added
                    tax (“VAT”) and withholding tax (“WHT”). Columbia
                    alleged that these breaches caused them loss which fell into two categories:
                        <em>actual</em> tax exposures and <em>potential</em> tax exposures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The actual tax exposures arose as a result
                    of additional tax assessments made by the ITA between 2008 and 2013, in respect
                    of PTNM’s transactions for the years 2004 to 2007. The Hongs did not
                    dispute that the ITA has in fact conducted these additional assessments, and
                    that Columbia has had to pay sums to the ITA as a result of these
                    assessments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Next, the potential tax exposures. Columbia
                    claimed that it may become subject to potential tax exposures if the ITA reopens
                    tax audit for the years 2004 to 2007, on the basis that a tax crime that has
                    been committed. In the event that this happens, the potential tax exposures will
                    include any additional sums of tax which PTNM would be liable for, any penalties
                    which the ITA may impose, and the legal costs of dealing with the concomitant
                    investigation, prosecution, or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    It is important to appreciate that, on the
                    assumption that I find the Hongs to be in breach, the loss falling within the
                    category of actual tax exposures have already been incurred by Columbia at the
                    time of the action. In contrast, the loss falling within the category of
                    potential tax exposures is inchoate: there is a chance the loss might occur;
                    there is a chance there might be no loss at all. Whether or not this category of
                    loss will crystallise is contingent on the ITA reopening an audit. This
                    distinction between the actual and potential categories of loss is crucial in
                    understanding the relief sought by Columbia under the third main issue, which
                    will be dealt with in a subsequent section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The fourth main issue relates to
                    PTNM’s alleged improper inflation of revenue by dressing up under-declared
                    and under-paid tax as revenue. Columbia alleged that as a result of this revenue
                    inflation, it paid more for the Sale Shares than it would have, had PTNM’s
                    books been true and accurate. Columbia thus claimed for the diminution in the
                    value of the Sale Shares as a result of these breaches of
                warranties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    It will be seen that there is a factual
                    overlap between the third and the fourth main issues: both sets of alleged
                    breaches arise from the <em>same act</em> of characterising
                    under-declared and under-paid tax as revenue. The same act nevertheless gives
                    rise to (purported) breaches of distinct warranties, which are capable of
                    sustaining distinct claims against the Hongs. There is also a degree of legal
                    overlap between Columbia’s claims under the third and fourth main issues.
                    This is because (on the assumption I find the Hongs to be in breach) the losses
                    suffered by Columbia for under-declaration and under-payment of tax on the one
                    hand, and for the inflation of revenue on the other, are, to some extent,
                    obverse sides of <em>the same coin</em>. The allegation was
                    that the avoided taxes were dressed up as revenue. Without one, there would not
                    be the other. Thus, while I examine these claims as distinct issues, I remain
                    aware that they are connected. In particular, I am also aware of the possibility
                    of double recovery if full relief is awarded for both these claims
                    cumulatively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    I now turn to address the questions raised
                    by the third main issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of relevant facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Columbia’s case is that in or around
                    May 2008, after fully taking over the management of the Hospital, it discovered
                    that PTNM had been under-declaring and under-paying WHT whilst it was under the
                    control of the Hongs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Prem Abraham gave evidence that in the
                    course of visits to the Hospital, Norman Chong, an employee of Columbia, had
                    spoken to Kimun Kuara, a finance executive of PTNM, who told him about the
                    Hospital’s practice of under-declaring Art 21 WHT in relation to
                    doctors’ fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    There was also an email dated 5 August 2004
                    (about three and a half years earlier) from Kimun Kuara to K C Leong, the
                    financial controller of PTNM at that material time, stating that the Hospital
                    was declaring and paying only 40% of the Art 21 WHT it should have been
                    paying in relation to doctors’ fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span>
                    Another document with the title “DOCTOR FEE TAX ARRANGEMENT” was
                    also in evidence and set out the mechanics of this arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> According to Prem Abraham, this document was
                    part of the hospital records and was handed to Norman Chong. Norman Chong and
                    Prem Abraham only discovered it, together with the email dated 5 August
                    2004, around April 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    On the other hand, the Hongs claimed that
                    Columbia was aware about the under-declaration and under-payment of taxes, and
                    did not view it as a problem. Edward Hong alleged that a meeting took place
                    between himself, Eddie Foo and Rick Evans in March 2008. Edward Hong stated that
                    at the meeting, it was explained that “consistent with what we were
                    advised as the industry practice, the withholding tax on doctors’ fees
                    would be slightly under-declared”. He claimed that “[n]either Rick
                    Evans nor Columbia’s solicitors raised any problems with the tax issues at
                    that meeting ... it was a non issue”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>
                    Columbia denied such a meeting took place. There was also no reference to such a
                    meeting in any correspondence between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    It is undisputed that Rick Evans and Edward
                    Hong met on 30 May 2008, and that tax issues were discussed at this meeting
                    (see [81] above). During this meeting, Rick Evans told Edward Hong about what he
                    had discovered in relation to the Hospital’s past tax practices and
                    explained Columbia’s intention, as new owners of the Hospital, to put a
                    stop to these practices and comply with Indonesian law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    On 2 June 2008, Edward Hong sent an
                    email to Rick Evans in relation to the matters discussed at the 30 May 2008
                        meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Edward Hong’s email of
                    2 June 2008 stated that the practice of under-declaring withholding tax had
                    been in place since the inception of the Hospital, and that there had never been
                    a problem with the ITA. According to Edward Hong, if Columbia’s change of
                    practice triggered a tax audit for past years and led to the assessment and
                    imposition of additional taxes and penalties, the Vendors should
                    “properly” not be held responsible for this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    On 11 June 2008, Rick Evans responded
                    stating that the Vendors were bound by the SSA and could not unilaterally
                    absolve themselves from liability, whether of UMPL or PTNM, flowing from the
                    failure in the past to observe or comply with the relevant tax
                        legislation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    In the meantime, Columbia had given
                    instructions to its auditors, Deloitte, to conduct a tax review for the fiscal
                    years 2005 to 2008. Pursuant to these instructions, a tax memorandum dated
                    23 October 2008 was prepared. This memorandum highlighted areas of concern
                    and Deloitte was asked to engage in a closer analysis of WHT and VAT. This led
                    to a further report dated 12 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Prem Abraham sent a letter to the Hongs
                    dated 28 October 2008 concerning a number of outstanding issues including
                    the Land Issue and PTNM’s records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The letter
                    referred to Deloitte’s 23 October 2008 memorandum and stated that the
                    memorandum had highlighted potential tax exposures arising from improper
                    book-keeping practices and the under-payment of Art 21 WHT on
                    doctors’ fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    On 30 October 2008, MKP issued a lengthy
                    letter in response to Prem Abraham’s letter. MKP accused Columbia of
                    raising “non-issues”, and that “[the under-declaration of
                    WHT on doctors’ fees] had been raised with and discussed with [Columbia]
                    before the SSA was signed, and they have been fully appraised of the
                    matter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    From 2008 to 2013, PTNM underwent a tax
                    audit by the ITA. In 2012 and early 2013, the ITA issued additional tax

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is common ground that Columbia has paid IDR
                        7,027,522,992 to the ITA between 26 April 2012 and 14 November
                        2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Hongs are liable under the SSA for breaches of warranties
                relating to the tax position of PTNM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Columbia argued that the under-declaration
                    and under-payment of taxes breached a number of warranties contained in the
                    Third Schedule to the SSA, namely that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_a"></a>(a)     the audited accounts and management
                        accounts of PTNM gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of PTNM
                        at 31 December 2006 and 30 November 2007 respectively
                        (s 3.1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_b"></a>(b)     full provision had been made for all actual and contingent liabilities in
                        the relevant accounts (ss 3.1.1 and 3.1.2);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_c"></a>(c)     neither PTNM nor the Hospital committed
                        “any criminal, illegal or other unlawful act ...”
                        (s 5.6);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_d"></a>(d)     PTNM had duly made all tax returns and had provided the necessary
                        information to the relevant authorities, and that this information was
                        correct and made on a proper basis (s 6.1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_e"></a>(e)     there was no liability to taxation in
                        respect of transactions effected before completion (s 6.2);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_f"></a>(f)     the statutory
                        records and books of PTNM contained true, full and accurate records of all
                        matters required to be dealt with (s 15).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The Hongs raised three arguments in
                    response. The first argument was that the accounts were true and accurate, for a
                    number of reasons. First, the accounts were audited by PTNM’s auditors,
                    Grant Thornton, and the ITA did not question the accounts. Second, the directors
                    of PTNM appointed by Columbia had accepted that the accounts were true and
                    accurate. Third, that at a meeting in or around March 2008, Rick Evans accepted
                    Edward Hong’s and Eddie Foo’s explanation about the original tax
                    position of PTNM. Fourth, at the 30 May 2008 meeting, Rick Evans further
                    confirmed that he was aware of the standard industry practice regarding
                    under-declaration of Art 21 WHT in respect of doctors’ fees. Fifth, all
                    liabilities and obligations in respect of all taxes were discharged at
                    31 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The fifth reason leads onto the Hongs’
                    second argument: that the representations and warranties in the SSA were
                    effective only up till 31 December 2008. The Hongs argued that that was the
                    true intention of the parties. They argued that the SSA should accordingly be
                    rectified to give effect to that intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The Hongs’ third argument was that
                    Columbia was estopped or precluded from alleging that taxes were under-declared
                    or under-paid. This was because Columbia had known of this from the due
                    diligence that it conducted. To buttress this argument, the Hongs pointed to a
                    report by Kusnandar &amp; Co (“Kusnandar”) (a firm that was
                    appointed by TMAL, Columbia’s solicitors, to conduct legal due diligence
                    on PTNM) that all relevant tax issues had been resolved at all times. I deal
                    with each of these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether the warranties on the tax position of PTNM were
                breached</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    It is clear that the Hongs’ first
                    argument that there has been no breach of warranty must fail (leaving aside the
                    Hongs’ second argument that the warranties were only effective up to
                    31 December 2008, which I will come to in a moment). It is undisputed that
                    the ITA made additional assessments against PTNM for the years 2004 to 2007
                    totalling IDR 7,027,522,992 (see above at [164]). The Hongs did not suggest that
                    these additional assessments were incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The very fact that the additional
                    assessments were made is a breach of the warranties in s 6 of the Third
                    Schedule to the SSA. The Hongs have also admitted (see above at [157] to [159])
                    that when PTNM was under the management of the Vendors, it had been deliberately
                    under-declaring and under-paying Art 21 WHT. Yet in their pleadings, the
                    Hongs maintained some form of denial that there was any under-declaration or
                    under-payment. Indeed, Columbia complained in its closing submissions that the
                    Hongs were blowing hot and cold: at times maintaining their denial, at others,
                    dropping it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    In these circumstances the other points
                    raised by the Hongs were non-starters. In the light of the subsequent additional
                    tax assessments made by the ITA, the Hongs’ position that PTNM’s
                    accounts were accepted with no query from the ITA is untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The Hongs’ reliance on the fact that
                    directors of PTNM appointed by Columbia signed off on PTNM’s accounts in
                    June 2008 is misplaced. Signing off on such accounts does not in any way affect
                    the contractual force of the warranties given by the Hongs. In my view, the
                    nominees were simply trying to allow PTNM to carry on its business without
                    alerting the ITA of the previous years’ shortcomings. While neither the
                    nominees nor Columbia had volunteered any information to the ITA about
                    under-declaration or under-payment of taxes, it is unrealistic to expect them to
                    have done so; they owe no such obligation to the Hongs. I say this because
                    counsel for the Hongs saw it fit to make the point about non-disclosure by
                    Columbia to the ITA during cross-examination of a witness for Columbia. Indeed,
                    it seems to me that if such information had been volunteered to the ITA, the
                    Hongs would have blamed Columbia for opening Pandora’s Box. It was quite
                    unfair for their counsel to make the point that he did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    In relation to the alleged meeting in March
                    2008 in which the under-declaration of withholding tax was dismissed, Rick Evans
                    has denied that there was such a meeting. I find that the Hongs have failed to
                    establish that this meeting took place. In any event, Edward Hong only alleged
                    that neither Rick Evans nor Columbia’s solicitors raised any problem on
                    the tax issue at that meeting. This is different from an allegation that Rick
                    Evans had in fact agreed not to insist on Columbia’s rights under the
                    SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    As regards the meeting on 30 May 2008,
                    I have referred above (at [158] and [159]) to the email from Edward Hong to Rick
                    Evans shortly thereafter on 2 June 2008. The email showed that there was no
                    such assurance from Rick Evans. That was why Edward Hong unilaterally tried to
                    assert that any review or back-taxes by the ITA should not be to the account of
                    the Vendors. That is also why Rick Evans replied on 11 January 2008 to
                    stress that the Vendors were bound by the SSA and could not extricate themselves
                    unilaterally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    I do not find Columbia’s own due
                    diligence or Kusnandar’s report to be relevant. I do not see how such
                    steps taken by Columbia could negate, whether by estoppel or otherwise, clear
                    warranties given by the Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the warranties in the SSA in relation to taxes were
                effective only up to 31 December 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    I will now address the Hongs’ second
                    argument that the tax warranties in the SSA were only valid and effective up to
                    31 December 2008. They relied on ss 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 of the SSA
                    which state that “this warranty in relation to taxes shall be valid up to
                    the 31 day of December 2008”. However, ss 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 deal
                    only with tax warranties relating to capital reserves. Accordingly, the Hongs
                    sought rectification of ss 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 of the SSA, such that they
                    apply to <em>all tax warranties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    It will be helpful to set out the
                    provisions, and the rectification that the Hongs sought:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">9.1.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... the Vendors hereby represent and warrant to

                                    whatsoever against [PTNM] for any repayment of such advances
                                    provided that this warranty shall be valid for a period of 6
                                    years from Completion Date.</del>
</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The struck-through portions are those that the Hongs were
                        seeking to expunge through rectification. It is immediately apparent that
                        the rectification sought by the Hongs will have a great effect on the
                        obligations of the Vendors under the SSA. It will extend the
                        31 December 2008 time limit from a narrow class of tax warranties (only
                        on capital reserves) to <em>all</em> tax
                        warranties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The Hongs argued that the terms, if
                    rectified, would reflect the true intentions of the parties. They relied on
                    cl 5 of the SFA, which was the in-principle agreement, prior to the
                    drafting of the SSA. Clause 5 of the SFA stated that the Vendors represented and
                    guaranteed that “all taxes ... shall be paid by the Vendor[s], provided
                    however, that this obligation of the Vendors shall expire on December 31,
                        2008”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    The law on rectification of contractual
                    terms for mistake is set out in two High Court cases. In <em>Maxz
                        Universal Development Group Pte Ltd v Shen Yixuan</em> [2009] SGHC
                    164, Lee Seiu Kin J stated at [22] that rectification of a contract is an
                    exercise of the court’s equitable jurisdiction when contracting parties
                    mistakenly draw up terms which militate against what they actually intended. The
                    court then laid out general principles applicable to rectification:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    There must be an “outward expression of
                            accord” in relation to the particular provision. It is not
                            necessary to show that there was a binding agreement prior to the
                            execution of the written document, but it must be shown that parties had
                            a continuing intention with regard to that provision down to the
                            execution of the written contract – see <em>Joscelyne v Nissen</em> [1970] 2 QB 86.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The burden of proof is on the party seeking
                            rectification and there must be very clear distinct evidence that there
                            was a different intention from the contract document at the time the
                            contract was entered into – see <em>Tucker v
                                Bennett</em> (1887) 38 Ch D 1, <em>Joscelyne v Nissen</em> [1970] 2 QB 86.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The denial of one of the parties that the deed as
                            it stands is contrary to his intention will have considerable weight,
                            and unless the other party can convince the court that the document does
                            not represent both parties’ intentions at the time of execution,
                            rectification will only be ordered exceptionally. It is not sufficient
                            to show that the written contract does not represent the true intention
                            of the parties, it must be shown that the written contract was actually
                            contrary to the intention of the parties – see <em>Lloyd v Stanbury</em> [1971] 1 WLR
                        535.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    There must be a literal disparity between the
                            terms of the prior agreement and those of the document which it is
                            sought to rectify. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    In <em>Pender Development Pte
                        Ltd and another v Chesney Real Estate Group LLP</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R)
                    1063, Andrew Ang J emphasised at [20] that “[t]he degree of
                    probability to be established in rectification proceedings [is] a high one,
                    similar to that of “convincing proof””.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The extent of the rectification, coupled
                    with the high threshold necessary for rectification, made the task the Hongs
                    faced an uphill one. The Hongs had to show “convincing proof” that
                    the common intention of the parties at the time of contracting was that all of
                    the tax warranties given by the Vendors’ were to lapse on 31 December
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In my view, this position is unsustainable
                    on the evidence. The sequence of events leading up to the execution of the SSA
                    shows that this was clearly not the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_a"></a>(a)     Alan Lim’s evidence was that
                        when Rick Evans first sent the SFA to him, he gave Rick Evans his opinion

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_d"></a>(d)     MKP sent a

                        This was done because the underlined portion appeared to be contrary to
                        cl 5 of the SFA, and because it appeared to impose liability on the
                        Vendors for payment of tax imposed on PTNM beyond the completion date, and
                        that it was never the Vendors’ obligation to pay PTNM’s
                        taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_e"></a>(e)     According to Alan Lim, the matter of the Vendors’ obligations
                        concerning PTNM’s taxes was discussed during the meeting between the
                        parties on 7 December 2007. This was before the Vendors signed the SSA
                        on the same day. Alan Lim gave the following evidence as to why he objected
                        to cl 5 of the SFA:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I objected to the wide clause that was required of my client to be
                            included in the SSA as reflected in the SFA. After -- I recall I asked
                            Mr Eddie Foo any reason to limit the warranty period to just one year,
                            was there something that he ought to tell us, or is there something
                            wrong that he better disclose at that point in time so that my client
                            could make an informed decision. But nothing was disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">And then Mr Rick Evans finally agreed to only limitation, the
                            exclusion clause is limited to capital reserve, as reflected in
                            9.1.1.13; and 9.1.1.14 was also discussed, they were advanced by
                            shareholders. Again, as I recall there was attempt to limit it to one
                            year, but I objected, I insisted it should be at least a limitation
                            period of six years applicable in Singapore, Indonesia for that matter.
                            These two clauses were the result of the negotiation that day.
                            That’s my recollection counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    More importantly, Alan Lim elaborated that
                    ss 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 of the SSA were inserted by the Vendors’ own
                    solicitor, Josephine Low of MKP, before the SSA was executed by the Vendors.
                    According to Alan Lim, after the parties completed their discussion on
                    7 December 2007, Josephine Low and himself went into another room where she
                    made the amendments on her laptop while he was beside her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Significantly, Mr Niru Pillai
                    (“Mr Pillai”), counsel for the Hongs in the proceedings,
                    informed the court that the Hongs’ position was that ss 9.1.1.13 and
                    9.1.1.14 were not discussed at that meeting. Furthermore, Mr Pillai stated
                    that according to Josephine Low, she had nothing to do with the insertion of
                    these clauses. It was Alan Lim who had inserted them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Yet, the
                    Hongs chose not to call Josephine Low to give evidence. There was no suggestion
                    that she was out of the country or was a hostile witness. I draw an adverse
                    inference against the Hongs for this omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Mr Pillai put to Alan Lim that the
                    words “capital reserves” and “taxation on capital
                    reserves” were never discussed, much less agreed upon.
                    Mr Pillai’s case put to Alan Lim was that those terms were mistakenly
                    inserted due to “templating”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> Columbia rightly pointed
                    out in closing submissions that this allegation was absurd.
                    Sections 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 of the SSA appeared in none of the previous
                    drafts. They could not have been inserted due to
                        “templating”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The Hongs also relied on the fact that Rick
                    Evans admitted that he did not know the meaning of “capital
                    reserves” in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> In my view,
                    this is neither here nor there. It did not mean that the SSA should be rectified
                    in the manner sought by the Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    I find Alan Lim to be a steady witness. In
                    the light of his evidence that it was Josephine Low who inserted the provisions
                    in dispute, coupled with the Hongs’ deliberate decision not to call
                    Josephine Low to give evidence to the contrary, I accept Alan Lim’s
                    evidence on the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    There is another point against the Hongs on
                    the issue of rectification. Before 30 August 2012, the Hongs took the
                    position that s 9.1.1.13 of the SSA was consistent with cl 5 of the
                    SFA. Hence, there was no need for rectification of s 9.1.1.13.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> It
                    was only on 30 August 2012 that they decided to apply to amend their
                    pleadings to include the plea for rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The Hongs were clearly blowing hot and cold.
                    If the provision really ought to have been rectified, they would have taken that
                    position from the outset. It would have been plainly obvious that what was
                    stated in the SSA did not capture the true intention of the parties. They would
                    not have taken contradictory positions and inserted their plea for rectification
                    of s 9.1.1.13 of the SSA so late.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The Hongs argued that it was unjust for the
                    Vendors to be perpetually liable for any additional tax liability of PTNM for
                    the relevant years. In my view, this argument is a non-starter. The Vendors knew
                    what they were in for. They could have sold the Sale Shares on an “as is
                    where is” basis. Indeed, this was an argument that was raised. The fact
                    is that they did not. They agreed to give warranties and it would be unjust to
                    allow them to renege on the warranties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    I conclude that the Hongs’ case for
                    rectification of ss 9.1.1.13 and 9.1.1.14 must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether Columbia was estopped from alleging that the taxes
                were under-declared and under-paid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    This defence will be dealt with below (at
                    [233]–[239]) in relation to the Inflated Revenue issue, where the Hongs
                    adopted a similar argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate measure of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    I mentioned above that Columbia claimed for
                    two categories of loss: actual tax exposures and potential tax exposures. The
                    relief sought by Columbia was rather unhappily framed. Columbia argued that it
                    was entitled to damages for loss of a chance to negotiate a lower purchase price
                    for the Sale Shares and a full indemnity from the Hongs for the actual tax
                    exposures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In relation to loss of a chance, Columbia
                    asserted that if it was aware of the potential tax liabilities, it would have
                    sought a further reduction of the price of the Sale Shares to that extent. It
                    asserted that there was a real and substantial chance that the Hongs would have
                    agreed to a discount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Columbia had to seek relief in this
                    circuitous manner because the loss from the potential tax exposures was
                    inchoate; it had not crystallised into a liability that had been or will be
                    imposed on PTNM. On the other hand, the actual tax exposures were liabilities
                    that had already been imposed on PTNM. Columbia therefore claimed a full
                    indemnity from the Hongs for the actual tax exposures. Columbia acknowledged
                    that there was a substantial overlap in both these claims. If the former claim
                    was allowed, an appropriate portion of potential tax exposures should be removed
                    from the latter claim to avoid double recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Columbia relied on expert evidence to
                    quantify the potential tax exposure PTNM might become subject to as a result of
                    the Vendors’ breaches. Roy Tedja (Columbia’s expert) and Nick Graham
                    (the Hongs’ expert), both agreed that the tax assessments issued for 2005
                    to 2007 represented the final assessment of taxes for those years in the
                        <em>absence of a tax crime</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> The experts disagreed as to the likelihood of
                    the tax authorities reopening an audit for those years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Roy Tedja was of the opinion that a tax
                    crime had been committed,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> and so, the previous tax
                    practice of PTNM may have led to the ITA reopening an audit. Nick Graham, on the
                    other hand, asserted that under-declaration of tax <em>could</em> be treated as a tax crime, but that was not necessarily
                        so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> He thus concluded that it was not certain
                    whether the ITA could reopen an audit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    The table below summarises Roy Tedja’s
                    view of the potential tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) which
                    PTNM was liable for:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    This was the figure Columbia relied on for
                    the loss of a chance claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In my view, the question of the appropriate
                    measure of damages is best considered on the basis of first
                principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    In the first place, the statement of claim
                    did not plead damages by way of a loss of chance. In my view, a general plea for
                    damages is different from damages for loss of a chance. The latter has to be
                    clearly pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    In any event, the fundamental principle of
                    compensation is that the appropriate measure of damages is “that sum of
                    money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered,
                        <em>in the same position as he would have been in if he had
                        not sustained the wrong</em> for which he is now getting his
                    compensation” [emphasis added]: <em>Livingstone v Rawyards
                        Coal Co</em> (1880) LR 5 App Cas 25. As noted in <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen
                    ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The Law of Contract
                        in Singapore</em>”) at para 21.002:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To do this, we need to identify what it is that the promise has <em>lost</em> by occurrence of the breach. That is to say, we
                        need to see what position the promisee <em>would have been
                            in</em>, had the contract not been breached, and then compare that
                        with the position that the promisee <em>is now in</em>,
                        given that the contract has been breached. The difference between those two
                        positions is the promisee’s “loss”. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    On the present facts, it is clear that if
                    the Hongs had not breached the relevant warranties in the SSA, there would
                    simply have been no under-declaration and under-payment of tax: all PTNM’s
                    taxes for the years 2005 to 2007 would have been correctly paid and recorded in
                    its accounts. If there were no breach, PTNM would simply not be liable to pay
                    any additional tax for the years 2005 to 2007. The ordinary and the obvious way
                    of addressing the situation is to hold the Hongs liable to indemnify Columbia by
                    paying to Columbia any amount PTNM has paid or might have to pay in tax for
                    those years of assessment. This would involve granting:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_203-p2_a"></a>(a)     an order for the Hongs to reimburse
                        Columbia in respect of the additional taxes that Columbia has actually paid;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_203-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
                        declaration that the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for any future
                        tax assessments which might be brought for the same years (presumably if an
                        audit is reopened on the basis that a tax crime has occurred), as well as
                        any additional penalties which may be imposed and/or any costs (including
                        legal costs) which might be incurred in dealing with any investigation
                        and/or prosecution by the tax authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    In my view, the above orders would have the
                    effect of putting Columbia in as good a position as it would have been in, had
                    there been no breach of the relevant warranties. This would give effect to the
                    fundamental principle of compensatory damages. Put simply, the difference
                    between Columbia’s present position, and Columbia’s position had the
                    relevant warranties not been breached, was the risk of PTNM incurring further
                    tax liabilities for the relevant years of assessment. It is the monetary value
                    of this risk which I am now attempting to quantify.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Columbia asserted that the monetary value of
                    this risk is equivalent to the discount that it would have been likely to
                    obtain, had it been made aware of the true state of affairs at the time of
                    contracting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The basis of this claim is that Columbia
                    lost a chance to re-negotiate the purchase price of the Sale Shares. The problem
                    with this approach is that it presupposes that Columbia would have sought a
                    discount, and that the Vendors would have been likely to grant it. Yet, while
                    Columbia made arguments that there was a real and substantial chance of the
                    Hongs re-negotiating the purchase price, they did not adduce any evidence on the
                    likelihood of obtaining a reduction in the purchase price and the extent of the
                    reduction. Furthermore, in my view, this is not a situation where the SSA is
                    silent on the point and Columbia lost a chance to use it to re-negotiate the
                    purchase price. The SSA expressly provides for warranties, including those which
                    Columbia now rely on. Since the warranties cover the situation, it is not open
                    to Columbia to argue for something else like the possibility of a reduction in
                    price as opposed to the ordinary damages for breach of warranty. Columbia did
                    proceed with the transaction considering itself sufficiently protected by the
                    numerous detailed warranties given by the Vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The approach preferred at [203] above has
                    the benefit of certainty and avoids any windfall to either side. I add that this
                    approach is consistent with the wording of the indemnities contained in
                    s 8.4.3 of the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    I will now address the cut-off date for
                    additional tax assessments which the Hongs remain liable to indemnify Columbia.
                    On 26 March 2014, the parties were asked to make submissions on the
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    For the sake of clarity, the cut-off date
                    refers to the final date of transactions for which PTNM may incur a tax
                    liability and which the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for, regardless
                    of when the tax assessment is made. In other words, if the ITA makes an
                    additional tax assessment for a transaction that occurred <em>before</em> the cut-off date, the Hongs will have to indemnify
                    Columbia for the additional liability. It does not matter that the ITA
                    assessment is made <em>after</em> the cut-off date. I
                    mention this because the latest submission for the Hongs reiterated that they
                    are not liable for any tax liability assessed after a certain cut-off date even
                    if the tax liability is for a transaction which occurred before the cut-off
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Columbia’s position was that the
                    cut-off date was the date of completion, 22 January 2008. It relied, in
                    particular, on s 8.4.3 of the SSA, the indemnity provision. The provision
                    stated that the Vendors agreed to indemnify Columbia for tax liabilities
                    “arising from any transaction effected or deemed to have been effected on
                    or before the Completion Date ...”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    On the other hand, the Hongs made various
                    submissions on the excuse of giving context to the short point they were asked
                    to address. I need only refer to those submissions which were relevant to the
                    cut-off date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    The Hongs argued that Columbia’s claim
                    for the tax indemnity was an afterthought. They also stated that the cause of
                    action for an indemnity had not arisen, because additional tax liability had not
                    yet been incurred. Finally, they stated that the cut-off date was
                    31 December 2007. They relied on evidence given by Rick Evans in
                    cross-examination that the Vendors were not liable for any taxes accruing after
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    These points may be dealt with shortly. It
                    is clear, from what I have already discussed above, that Columbia’s claim
                    for the tax indemnity was not an afterthought. As I have laid out above,
                    Columbia’s claim encompasses both <em>actual</em> and
                        <em>potential</em> tax liabilities. Furthermore, the
                    SSA clearly supports its claim for the tax indemnity. The actual tax liabilities
                    have already accrued. The sums which PTNM has had to pay the ITA have been
                    ascertained and established. Therefore, Columbia has a good cause of action
                    against the Hongs on the indemnity for those sums. I will order the Hongs to
                    indemnify Columbia in respect of the actual tax liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    In respect of the potential tax liabilities,
                    I agree with the Hongs that insofar as no further assessments have yet been
                    made, the liability to indemnify has not yet arisen. Nonetheless, I am of the
                    view that it is appropriate to grant a declaration that the Hongs are to
                    indemnify Columbia for any future tax assessments and the associated penalties
                    and/or costs. I have set out the principles governing the grant of declaratory
                    relief above, and do not propose to go into them again. It suffices to say that
                    there was a real controversy between the parties as to the existence, extent and
                    scope of the indemnities provided by the Hongs under the SSA, making declaratory
                    relief appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I will now deal with the cut-off date for
                    the indemnities. I am of the view that the SSA is clear on this point.
                    Section 8.4.3 of the SSA states that the Vendors are liable to indemnify
                    Columbia for any additional liabilities incurred in respect of transactions
                    occurring in the period on or before the completion date which is
                    22 January 2008. I do not regard as relevant Rick Evans’ evidence in
                    cross-examination that the Vendors were not liable for any taxes accruing after
                    2007. The obligations of the parties under the SSA cannot be affected by Rick
                    Evans’ misunderstanding of the legal effect of the SSA’s
                    provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 4: the Inflated Revenue Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Hongs are liable under the SSA for breaches of warranties
                relating to the revenue of PTNM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    Columbia’s case was that WHT and VAT
                    were under-declared, and instead reflected as a component of PTNM’s
                    revenue. As a consequence, PTNM’s EBITDA figure for the relevant period
                    was higher than it should have been. Columbia claimed that this was a breach of
                    the Vendors’ warranties listed above at [165]. Columbia asserted that the
                    loss it suffered was the diminution in value of the Sale Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    The Hongs raised two main arguments in their
                    defence. First, they argued that the warranties in the SSA did not induce
                    Columbia to enter into the SSA. They asserted that Columbia was fully aware of
                    PTNM’s actual tax position, and that Columbia instead relied on the
                    findings from their own due diligence exercise and the Kusnandar report. The
                    Hongs’ second argument was that Columbia was estopped from alleging that
                    taxes were under-declared or under-paid because Columbia knew that all relevant
                    taxes had been resolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether there was inflation of revenue due to WHT
                accounting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    It is quite clear from the discussion above
                    that there was under-declaration and under-payment of Art 21 WHT (see above
                    at [169] and [170]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    The experts for both parties were in
                    agreement that at least some Art 21 WHT was not paid to the ITA, and was
                    instead stored in a general ledger account for “other revenue”.
                    The experts agreed that the Hospital retained 7.5% of doctors’
                        fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> This entire
                    sum was supposed to be paid to the ITA as Art 21 WHT. But only
                    approximately 40% of this sum was recorded in the general ledger account for
                    intended payments to the ITA. The remainder of approximately 60% was recorded in
                    the general ledger account for “other revenue”, and not paid to
                    the ITA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> Nick Graham, the expert
                    witness for the Hongs, even made the qualification that in some instances, it
                    was even higher than 60%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Nick Graham’s and Roy Tedja’s
                    opinions differed only on the quantum of the inflated revenue due to
                    under-declared Art 21 WHT. In Roy Tedja’s first affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, he concluded that IDR 989,952,563 in the general ledger
                    account for other revenue could be traced to the under-declared and under-paid
                    Art 21 WHT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> Nick Graham, on the other hand, concluded that
                    the figure was only IDR 853,013,874.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Nick Graham suggested that there were two
                    reasons for this discrepancy. First, because “other journals use
                    sequential numbers for each entry and/or there is a different reference system
                    for some journals”; and second, the possibility that the general ledger
                    account for other revenue “includes transactions other than the Article
                    21 WHT that has been withheld but not paid to the State
                        Treasury”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    Roy Tedja swore a second affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, in which he reappraised his first assessment. In doing so, he
                    took into account Nick Graham’s observations. As a result he revised the
                    figure in his assessment down to IDR 972,275,994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Nick Graham admitted that Roy Tedja was able
                    to obtain explanations from the employees of the Hospital.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> Nick Graham
                    did not question the truth or accuracy of what Roy Tedja was told by the
                    employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    Based on the foregoing, I am persuaded that
                    Roy Tedja’s figure should be preferred over Nick Graham’s.
                    Accordingly, I find that the inflation of PTNM’s 2007 revenue due to the
                    under-declaration and under-payment of Art 21 WHT was IDR
                972,275,994.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether there was inflation of revenue due to VAT
                accounting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    Roy Tedja was also of the opinion that PTNM
                    had not correctly accounted for VAT. There were two types of VAT that were
                    relevant: output VAT and input VAT. Output VAT is tax charged by PTNM to the
                    patient, which is then payable by PTNM to the ITA. Input VAT is tax charged by
                    PTNM’s suppliers to PTNM, which is then paid by PTNM’s suppliers to
                    the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Roy Tedja gave evidence that both these
                    forms of VAT were improperly recorded. PTNM recorded output VAT charged to
                    outpatients on the sale of medicines as a revenue item rather than as a
                    liability. It also recorded input VAT paid to suppliers for the purchase of
                    medicines as an expense rather than as an asset. By adding these items to the
                    profit and loss account, the inflation of PTNM’s 2007 revenue due to VAT
                    was IDR 277,033,514.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Nick Graham substantially agreed with the
                    reasoning above, but disagreed on the quantum of the inflated revenue. He was of
                    the opinion that the inflation of PTNM’s 2007 revenue due to VAT was only
                    IDR 267,835,481.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Nick Graham’s reason for the different

                        during January-February, 2007 that have a Document ID commencing
                        “IP”. From our brief discussion with Sumiaty’s
                        assistant, we understand that these represent a month-end accrual of
                        pharmacy supplies for Inpatients. If this is correct, then these balances
                        probably should not be included in the Outpatient Pharmacy Revenue account
                        for the purposes of considering potential overstatement of revenue. That is,
                        if these do relate to Inpatient Pharmacy Revenue then no VAT would apply (as
                        compared to Outpatient Pharmacy Revenue that is subject to VAT).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    Roy Tedja did not address Nick
                    Graham’s reason. Since the burden of proof is on Columbia, I am of the
                    view that Columbia has not proved its case on this point. I find that the
                    inflation in PTNM’s 2007 revenue due to VAT accounting was IDR
                    267,835,481.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Accordingly, I am of the view that the Hongs
                    are in breach of the warranties set out above at [165]. In particular, I note
                    that the experts are both in agreement that the PTNM’s 2007 revenue
                    figures have been inflated by improper book-keeping for WHT and VAT. I turn now
                    to address the defences raised by the Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether Columbia was induced to enter into the SSA by the
                Vendors’ warranties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    The Hongs’ first defence was that
                    Columbia was not induced by the warranties contained in the SSA to enter into
                    the transaction. Instead, Columbia relied on its own due diligence
                    exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    This argument misses the point.
                    Columbia’s claim was for breaches of warranties contained in the SSA.
                    Liability for breach of contract is strict; inducement to enter into the
                    contract is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    The argument about the absence of inducement
                    appears to have been raised on the mistaken premise that Columbia’s claim
                    was for misrepresentation, rather than breach of contract. While
                    Columbia’s pleadings were not completely clear on the point, Mr Kumar
                    clarified in open court,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> and in Columbia’s
                    reply submissions that the claim was for breach of contract, and not
                        misrepresentation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether Columbia was estopped from alleging that the revenue
                was inflated by the under-declared and under-paid tax</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    I come now to the Hongs’ second
                    argument on estoppel. Three elements have to be satisfied for estoppel by
                    representation to be made out (see <em>Chng Bee Kheng and another
                        (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng
                        Eng Chye</em> [2013] 2 SLR(R) 715 at [97]). First, there must have
                    been a representation of fact. Second, there must have been reliance on the
                    representation by the representee. Third, the representee must have suffered a
                    detriment as a result of the reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    I find that Columbia did not unequivocally
                    represent by words or conduct that it would not allege that PTNM’s taxes
                    were under-declared or under-paid, for five reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    First, there was no evidence that Columbia,
                    through the due diligence it conducted, came to know about the tax
                    irregularities leading to the overstatement of EBITDA. The documentary evidence,
                    such as the summaries of the due diligence exercise, indicate that it was not
                    detected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    Second, s 9.1.3 of the SSA specifically
                    provides that due diligence does <em>not</em> affect the
                    warranties provided in the SSA. It was therefore not open for the Hongs to rely
                    on the due diligence performed by Columbia to avoid their obligations under the
                    SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Third, the Hongs have failed to establish
                    the alleged meeting in mid-March 2008 and there was, in any event, no alleged
                    agreement at that meeting (see above at [173]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Fourth, the emails following the meeting on
                    30 May 2008 between Rick Evans and Edward Hong made it clear that Columbia
                    made no representation that it would not allege the tax irregularities. This was
                    stated categorically in the email from Rick Evans to Edward Hong on 11 June
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    Fifth, the mere fact that the
                    Columbia-nominated directors signed off on PTNM’s audited accounts in June
                    2008 was not a representation from Columbia to the Hongs that Columbia would not
                    allege that PTNM’s taxes were under-declared or under-paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appropriate measure of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    Columbia was claiming under s 8.4.2 of
                    the SSA for the Hongs to pay to Columbia an amount equal to “the
                    diminution in the value of the Sale Shares caused by the artificially inflated
                        revenue”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>
                    Columbia adduced expert evidence through James Searby that the diminution in
                    value ought to be calculated according to the following formula: [overstatement
                    of EBITDA] x [the appropriate multiplier]. The Hongs did not adduce any expert
                    evidence of an alternative basis for assessing the diminution in
                value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    It is well-established that damages for
                    breach of a warranty in a contract are to be assessed on the basis of what would
                    be required to put a plaintiff in the position he would have been in, had there
                    been no breach of the warranty. Belinda Ang J in <em>Holland
                        Leedon Pte Ltd v Metalform Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 3 SLR 377
                        (“<em>Holland Leedon</em>”) noted (at
                    [54]) that this may be assessed in one of two ways: with reference to the
                    diminution in value (the difference between the market value of the business
                    warranted and the actual value of the business) or the costs of
                cure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    The facts of <em>Holland
                        Leedon</em> are instructive. That case involved an appeal to the High
                    Court against a summary determination of issues of law before an arbitrator.
                    There, the respondent purchased the business and specified assets of the
                    appellant under a sale and purchase agreement. Several warranties in the sale
                    and purchase agreement pertaining to the business were breached. This resulted
                    in the incurrence of additional costs which led to a decrease in the EBITDA of
                    the business. The respondent argued that the diminution in value was the
                    difference between the EBITDA if the warranties had been true, multiplied by a
                    multiplier of 7, which was the contractually stipulated mechanism for
                    calculating the purchase price. The court agreed with the arbitrator that it was
                    not conceptually wrong for damages to be assessed by reference to the diminution
                    in value, which was calculated by recurring costs multiplied by 7. The court
                    nonetheless held that the suitability of such a formula was to be determined by
                    the arbitrator based on the evidence adduced at the hearing of the merits, as it
                    was a <em>factual determination</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    The decision of the English Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Senate Electrical Wholesalers Ltd v Alcatel Submarine
                        Networks Ltd (formerly STC Submarine Systems Ltd)</em> [1999] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 423 (“<em>Senate</em>”) is
                    also relevant. There, a business was sold to the plaintiff for £90m. The
                    plaintiff subsequently discovered that the profits of the business were
                    overstated by £1.7m. This was a breach of a warranty given by the seller.
                    The plaintiff quantified damages by applying a multiplier of 13.67 to the
                    difference between the warranted profit and the actual profit. The English Court
                    of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court, which rejected the
                    plaintiff’s approach. The English Court of Appeal observed (at [33] and
                    [34]) that applying a multiplier to the difference in actual and warranted
                    figures might be appropriate where the purchase price had been derived in that
                    manner. But it stressed that that was only one of the many ways of assessing the
                    damage. The English Court of Appeal was not convinced that that approach was
                    appropriate on the facts of the case. The court found that there were many other
                    factors, apart from the earnings, which induced the purchaser to pay the price
                    it did for the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    In the subsequent case of <em>Sycamore Bidco Ltd v Breslin</em> [2013] EWHC 3443, the English High
                    Court took the view that the exercise was an essentially factual one, of
                    valuation. It relied on expert evidence from both sides to assist it in coming
                    to the appropriate measure of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    The above three cases do not carry
                    Columbia’s case for the calculation of damages very far. They do not say
                    that Columbia’s formula should always be used. To the contrary, <em>Holland Leedon</em> and <em>Senate</em>
                    make it clear that the inquiry is fact-specific.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    Columbia had obtained expert evidence on
                    valuation from James Searby, whereas the Hongs did not obtain any expert
                    evidence on the point. This does not mean that the court must accept James
                    Searby’s evidence without question (see the observations of V K Rajah JA
                    in <em>Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983
                    at [76]). Indeed, Columbia did not push its argument that far. I now turn to the
                    facts relevant to the appropriate measure of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The facts and evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    Columbia argued that the diminution in value
                    ought to be calculated with reference to the [overstatement of EBITDA] x [the
                    appropriate multiplier] for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_247-p2_a"></a>(a)     The natural starting point for
                        determining the value of the Sale Shares as warranted was the price of US$31
                        million. Columbia’s case was that this price was in fact derived by
                        applying the formula of EBITDA x a multiplier of 12.4. The actual EBITDA of
                        PTNM up to and including October 2007 was incorporated into the SSA and
                        warranted to be accurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_247-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was appropriate for the business of a going concern
                        to be valued by reference to the profits or cash flows that it is expected
                        to bring to the owner in the future. The multiplier that Columbia used was
                        reasonable according to expert evidence in relation to the market conditions
                        during the time of completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_247-p2_c"></a>(c)     The actual value of the Sale Shares given the overstated
                        EBITDA was represented as a discount from the price of US$31m calculated by
                        reference to the sum of the overstatement of EBITDA applied to the multiple
                        of 12.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_247-p2_d"></a>(d)     Such
                        an approach was reasonable given that the alternative assessment under a
                        simplified discounted cash flow model yielded a close
                    result.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_247-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        appropriate time for valuing the diminution of value of the Sale Shares
                        ought to be the date of completion or 22 January 2008, the date of
                        breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    The Hongs denied that any formula was used
                    by the parties in agreeing on the actual purchase price. They also asserted that
                    the actual purchase price had been reached with reference to the replacement
                    costs of the Land and the Hospital. They implied that there was no variation in
                    the replacement costs. The Hongs’ alternative argument was that in any
                    event, Columbia did not use the formula it claimed to derive the actual purchase
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    It was undisputed that Rick Evans did not
                    discuss explicitly with Edward Hong the basis for deriving the purchase price.
                    Michael Chow, who gave evidence for the Hongs, claimed he was told by Rick Evans
                    that the replacement costs were considered in arriving at the actual purchase
                    price. This was the basis for the Hongs’ position that Rick Evans had
                    derived the actual purchase price from the replacement costs. The Hongs stressed
                    that Michael Chow’s evidence should be given more weight because, at the
                    material time, Michael Chow was an agent, if not an employee, of Columbia. He
                    therefore had no reason to lie for the Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    Rick Evans claimed he did not tell Michael
                    Chow that he had considered the replacement costs in deriving the actual
                    purchase price. Columbia suggested that Michael Chow was an independent party
                    from Columbia at the material time. Furthermore, Columbia alleged that Michael
                    Chow had business dealings with the Hongs at the time he swore his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief and when he gave oral evidence. Columbia argued that he was
                    partial to the Hongs, and that his evidence should be given less
                weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    I am not persuaded by Columbia’s
                    attempt to portray Michael Chow as an independent party at the material time. It
                    would not help Columbia even if Michael Chow was an independent party. That, in
                    itself, would not have been reason enough for him to favour the Hongs later when
                    litigation arose. I am also not persuaded that Michael Chow was being partial to
                    the Hongs because of his later business dealings with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Furthermore, even if I were to disregard
                    Michael Chow’s evidence on the point, Rick Evans’ own evidence as to
                    how he arrived at the actual purchase price was not as clear or unqualified as
                    Columbia would have liked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    As mentioned above, Rick Evans’
                    evidence was that he relied on EBITDA and the appropriate multiplier to derive
                    the actual purchase price. However, it is important to bear in mind that in his
                    own affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he had stated that he cross-checked the
                    figure with replacement costs. In cross-examination, he denied that he had
                    considered replacement costs. Yet when he was confronted with his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, he did not deny the reference to replacement
                        costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> Therefore, even on Rick
                    Evans’ own evidence alone, he had not relied solely on EBITDA with a
                    multiplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    The Hongs stressed in their closing
                    submissions that there was nothing in the SSA which stipulated that the actual
                    purchase price was derived from the EBITDA multiplied by an appropriate
                    multiplier, unlike in <em>Holland
                Leedon</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    Moreover, in oral evidence, James Searby
                        said<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It’s my view that replacement value is not an appropriate way to
                        value a going concern business. A going concern business should be valued by
                        reference to the profits or cash flows that you expect it to bring to the
                        owner in future, not either by reference to the profits that it has brought
                        in the past or by reference to the replacement cost of its assets. That is
                        because perhaps much, even most, of the value of any business is composed of
                        goodwill, which is not able to be valued at repayment cost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    Although James Searby was explaining why
                    replacement cost was not an appropriate way to value an ongoing business, he was
                    also saying that one does not rely on the business’ past performance to
                    derive the purchase price. Yet, that is what Rick Evans appeared to be claiming
                    he did, with his position that the price of the Sale Shares was derived solely
                    from the EBITDA of 2007 multiplied by the appropriate multiplier. Moreover, it
                    seems illogical to me that Rick Evans would rely on EBITDA for only one past
                    year to derive the actual purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    The Hongs had another argument. Even if
                    Columbia was unaware of the under-declaration and under-payment of tax and
                    inflation of revenue before the SSA was executed, the Hongs submitted that
                    Columbia knew about this after Deloitte’s memorandum dated 23 October
                    2008. Yet, there was no complaint by Columbia about overpayment for the Sale
                    Shares then. Even after Deloitte’s further report dated 12 February
                    2009, no complaint was made by Rick Evans at the 6 March 2009 meeting
                    (which Edward Hong had belatedly claimed was without prejudice). All Rick Evans
                    was concerned about then was the Land problem. Indeed, Mr Kumar clarified
                    orally to the court on 9 January 2014 that Columbia did not give prior
                    notice to the Hongs that it would claim a reduction in the actual purchase price
                    because of inflation of EBITDA until the writ of summons in Suit 964 was
                    filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    Having considered all the evidence, I am of
                    the view that Columbia has failed to establish that PTNM’s EBITDA coupled
                    with an appropriate multiplier was Rick Evans’ sole or main basis for
                    deriving the actual purchase price. That is why it was not mentioned
                    specifically to Edward Hong in pre-contract negotiations. That is also why the
                    SSA did not stipulate that the actual purchase price was derived on that basis.
                    That is why there was no complaint by Columbia about overpayment for the Sale
                    Shares at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    It seems to me that Rick Evans had
                    considered PTNM’s 2007 EBITDA as just one of several factors to determine
                    how much Columbia would pay. Only he knows precisely what all the other factors
                    were. Replacement cost was certainly one of them too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    In the circumstances, I am of the view that
                    Columbia has not discharged its burden of proving that the loss it suffered was
                    the inflation of ]=EBITDA multiplied by an appropriate multiplier. The actual
                    purchase price was based on a multitude of factors amongst which EBITDA was only
                    one. Furthermore, as I will grant Columbia an indemnity for any unpaid tax
                    (whether it be WHT or VAT or otherwise), I will not grant Columbia anything else
                    for inflation of EBITDA. In my view, there is no discrete loss for that
                    inflation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Suit 861</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    In Suit 861, Thermal Industries made two
                    claims against PTNM. The first, for the sum of S$262,934.48 which it purportedly
                    paid to MEC on PTNM’s behalf; the second, for the sum of S$10,000 for
                    second-hand servers which it supplied to PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    Columbia was allowed to be joined as a
                    defendant. Columbia and PTNM disputed that these debts were owed to Thermal
                    Industries. They further claimed an indemnity under the SSA against the Hongs as
                    third parties. PTNM was not a party to the SSA. It asserted that the CRTPA
                    allowed it to enforce certain provisions in the SSA against the
                Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    My analysis in relation to the primary claim
                    in Suit 861 will be as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_263-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether PTNM owed a debt of
                        S$262,934.48 to Thermal Industries; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_263-p2_b"></a>(b)     if (a) is answered in the affirmative,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_263-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether s 2.1.24 of
                            the SSA should be expunged or rectified to exclude the debt owed to the
                            Thermal Companies; and if not,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_263-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       whether the debt falls the scope of the
                            indemnities provided by the Vendors under the
                SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    Before doing so, I will first address the
                    Hongs’ preliminary objection that Columbia did not suffer any loss even if
                    the S$262,934.48 was owed by PTNM to Thermal Industries, because it was a
                    reflective loss. The argument was that PTNM was the one who had to pay the sums
                    due, and so, Columbia’s “loss” was merely a reflection of
                    the loss suffered by PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    In my view, this argument is not valid.
                    Columbia is entitled to rely on the SSA to claim a contractual right to an
                    indemnity; otherwise, the contractual right is meaningless. Whether the sum in
                    question falls within the scope of the contractual provision it relies on is
                    another matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    As for PTNM’s claim against the Hongs,
                    PTNM was not a party to the SSA. I infer that PTNM was joining Columbia in
                    making such a claim as a matter of caution, in case Columbia was somehow
                    precluded from relying on the SSA, for example, because of the reflective loss
                    argument. As Columbia is not precluded by the reflective loss argument from
                    making the counterclaim, the purpose of including PTNM to make the claim is
                    academic. In any event, for the reasons stated below, I am of the view that PTNM
                    has not established that it is entitled under the CRTPA to make a claim against
                    the Hongs under the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    PTNM had to rely on the CRTPA because it was
                    not a party to the SSA. The relevant provision is s 2 of the CRTPA and in
                    particular, ss 2(1)(<em>b</em>) and 2(2). Sections
                    2(1) and (2) of the CRTPA state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person
                        who is not a party to a contract (referred to in this Act as a third party)
                        may, in his own right, enforce a term of the contract if —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the contract
                                expressly provides that he may; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    subject to
                                subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on
                            him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subsection (1)(<em>b</em>)
                            shall not apply if, on a proper construction of the contract, it appears
                            that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third
                            party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    PTNM submitted that because s 3.4.1 of
                    the SSA required the Vendors to settle PTNM’s liabilities with money
                    received under the SSA, the SSA clearly purported to confer a benefit on
                    PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    PTNM relied on <em>CLAAS
                        Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng Boon Ching</em> [2010] 2 SLR 386
                        (“<em>CLAAS</em>”) at [28]. It submitted
                    that a provision to indemnify a third party has been held to confer a benefit on
                    the third party for the purposes of s 2(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the CRTPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    However, there is an important difference
                    between the facts in <em>CLAAS</em> and in the present
                    case. In <em>CLAAS</em>, the provision in question
                    expressly stated that liquidated damages for a breach were payable to the third
                    party. In the present case, there is no such provision. The indemnity is given
                    to Columbia and it does not state that payment is to be made to
                PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    As is obvious from ss 2(1)(<em>b</em>) and 2(2) of the CRTPA, there are two limbs to be
                    considered if the contract does not expressly provide that a third party, who is
                    not a party to the contract, may enforce a term of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    The first limb is s 2(1)(<em>b</em>). Under this limb, the court has to consider whether
                    the contractual term purports to confer a benefit on the third
                party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    If so, then the second limb has to be
                    considered. If it appears that the parties to the contract did not intend for
                    the contractual term to be enforced by the third party, then the third party
                    will not be entitled to enforce it, notwithstanding that that the term purports
                    to confer a benefit on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    The Court of Appeal in <em>CLAAS</em> said at [28] and [29]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    … There is no requirement that benefiting
                            the third party must be the predominant purpose or intent behind the
                            term. However, it must be a purpose of the parties. <em>Prima facie</em>, s 2(1)(<em>b</em>) is
                            applicable to enable the Appellant to enforce cl 11 [of the
                            agreement in question] because cl 11(c) has expressly stated that
                            the liquidated damages for a breach of the clause are payable to the
                            Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    However, s 2(1)(<em>b</em>)
                            must be read with s 2(2). The latter provision (quoted at [26] above)
                            enables a party to a contract to show that, on a proper construction of
                            the contract, the parties did not intend the terms therein to be
                            enforceable by a third party. … It seems to us that what s
                                2(1)(<em>b</em>) and s 2(2) seek to do is to
                            distinguish between intended and incidental beneficiaries to a contract,
                            with the latter beneficiaries not being entitled to sue under the
                            contract. The burden of proof rests on the party who invokes s 2(2) to
                            show, on a proper construction of the contract, that the parties did not
                            intend the term concerned to be enforceable by the third
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    It is not clear from [29] of the judgment in
                        <em>CLAAS</em> whether the distinction between intended
                    and incidental beneficiaries is to be applied when the court is considering the
                    first limb, the second limb, or both limbs. Logically, the same test or guide
                    should not apply to both limbs otherwise only one limb should suffice. Should
                    then the distinction between intended and incidental beneficiaries be applied to
                    the first or the second limb?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    In <em>Dolphin Maritime &amp;
                        Aviation Services Ltd v Sveriges Angfartygs Assurans Forening</em>
                    [2009] Lloyd’s Rep 123, the English High Court was of the view that as
                    regards the English equivalent of the first limb:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74.    A contract does not purport to confer a benefit on
                            a third party simply because the position of that third party will be
                            improved if the contract is performed. The reference in the section to
                            the term purporting to “confer” a benefit seems to me to
                            connote that the language used by the parties shows that one of the
                            purposes of their bargain (rather than one of its incidental effects if
                            performed) was to benefit the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    This suggests that the English court was of
                    the view that the distinction between intended and incidental beneficiaries
                    applies to the first limb.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    This is logical. It is only when a third
                    party establishes that it is an intended beneficiary of the contract that the
                    burden then shifts, under the second limb, to the party giving the indemnity or
                    warranty (“the Warranting Party”), to show that notwithstanding
                    that the third party is an intended beneficiary, the parties to the contract did
                    not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party. It is not logical for
                    the Warranting Party to have the burden of showing that the third party is not
                    intended to enforce the term if the third party has not yet established that it
                    is an intended beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    Therefore, the first question is whether
                    PTNM was an intended or incidental beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    I do not agree with PTNM’s submission
                    that just because s 3.4.1 of the SSA requires the Hongs to settle
                    PTNM’s liabilities with money received under the SSA, the SSA purported to
                    confer a benefit on PTNM. Such a submission draws no distinction between an
                    intended and an incidental beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    The purpose of that provision was for the
                    benefit of Columbia because Columbia was paying the actual purchase price on a
                    certain basis, <em>ie</em>, that various liabilities would
                    be paid off by PTNM. The Hongs gave the warranty because they wanted a certain
                    purchase price. True, the payment of the liabilities would benefit PTNM, but
                    this was only incidentally so. The intended beneficiary was Columbia, and only
                    Columbia. If PTNM was an intended beneficiary, then arguably, its holding
                    company would also be an intended beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    Assuming that I am incorrect on the
                    application of the first limb to the facts before me, I am of the view that on
                    an objective construction, the parties to the SSA did not intend PTNM to enforce
                    any of the warranties in the SSA. The warranties were made to protect the
                    contractual bargain between Columbia and the Hongs and in view of the actual
                    purchase price that Columbia was paying. Without the SSA, the Hongs have no
                    obligation to pay for liabilities of PTNM and there is no reason why they should
                    incur a liability to an additional party like PTNM because of the actual
                    purchase price. Furthermore, if, for example, there was a change in
                    Columbia’s plans and it were to sell its shares in UMPL and it was not
                    interested in pursuing a claim for any breach of SSA, it is clear to me that
                    neither Columbia or the Hongs would expect PTNM to be entitled to pursue such a
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    Accordingly, I conclude that PTNM is not
                    entitled to rely on the CRTPA to enforce the terms of the SSA.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    Thermal Industries’ claim for
                    US$740,000 is in relation to four payments it allegedly made to MEC on
                    PTNM’s behalf. The enquiry with respect to this claim begins with a loan
                    provided by MEC to Thermal International pursuant to a letter of offer and a
                    hire-purchase agreement dated 26 June 2002 for US$3m. In July 2002, on the
                    instructions of Edward Hong, as Managing Director of Thermal International, MEC
                    transferred US$740,000 of the US$3m loan directly to PTNM. MEC subsequently
                    assigned its rights under the hire-purchase agreement to GSAF by way of a sale
                    and purchase agreement dated 30 September 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The recording of the loans on PTNM’s accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    While PTNM only received US$740,000 in
                    funds, the transaction came to be reflected in PTNM’s books as a <em>US$3m</em> loan from Thermal International, as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    In or around 2003, the managers of PTNM
                    apparently ran into some difficulty in relation to how the sum of US$740,000 was
                    to be recorded in PTNM’s books. For various reasons, and following
                    internal correspondence between Eddie Foo, Kimun Kuara and Arthur Pittman, the
                    Managing Director of PTNM, the preferred course of action appeared to be for
                    Thermal <em>Industries</em> to enter into a fabricated loan
                    agreement with PTNM for US$3m. This fabricated loan agreement would include the
                    US$740,000 which had been paid by MEC to PTNM as directed by Thermal
                    International.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    The reason for this elaborate scheme was
                    explained by Eddie Foo in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> According to
                    Eddie Foo, PTNM had, since its inception, been the recipient of a number of
                    substantial shareholder’s loans. These loans had subsequently been written
                    off. There was, at the material time, a desire by UMPL’s shareholders to
                    try to claw back at least US$3m of these funds. It was somehow decided by the
                    Hospital’s management that this would be best achieved by writing in a
                    fictional US$3m loan into PTNM’s books. According to Edward Hong, the
                    reason for wanting to treat the lender of this US$3m loan as Thermal Industries,
                    instead of Thermal International (who actually advanced the lesser sum of
                    US$740,000 to PTNM), was that Thermal International was a 51% subsidiary of the
                    Parkway Group. Thermal International therefore could not make the loan to PTNM
                    due to the Parkway Group’s corporate structure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    The arrangement appeared to be engineered by
                    Eddie Foo,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> as evidenced by his numerous emails, including
                    one on 31 December 2004 where he stated that “the subject US$740,000
                    is a part of the US$ 3m loan on a “back-to-back” basis with
                    [Thermal Industries].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>
                    This was also the way PTNM represented the loan to its external auditors, Grant
                    Thornton, as seen in Arthur Pittman’s letter of representation dated
                    8 January 2004:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n the interest of expediting the settlement of the matter ... this
                        US$740,000 should be netted against the US$3m loan through [Thermal
                        Industries] and the whole thing be contra-ed against the write-off to
                        General Reserve ...and with the US$3m recorded as a loan from [Thermal
                        Industries].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The arrangement was again reflected in Eddie Foo’s email
                        of 15 January 2004 to K C Leong, the financial controller of PTNM,
                        where he wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I would suggest you reclassify that US$740,000 as having come as part
                            of the US$3m loan from [Thermal Industries]—which is basically
                            where [Thermal Industries] got the funds from anyway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    A number of documents were created in
                    furtherance of this scheme,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span>
                    including:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_289-p2_a"></a>(a)     a signed agreement marked July
                        2002, with the exact date left blank, for a loan of US$3m from Thermal
                        Industries to PTNM for the “purchase of equipment and working
                        capital”, with interest set at 8.75%;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_289-p2_b"></a>(b)     another signed loan agreement between PTNM and Thermal
                        Industries, on identical terms as the first, but this time dated
                        1 November 2002;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_289-p2_c"></a>(c)     an unsigned debt confirmation letter from PTNM to
                        Thermal Industries dated 19 November 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As can be seen, there are numerous documents indicating that it was
                        intended, at the very least between 2002 and 2004, for the transaction to be
                        treated in PTNM’s books as a loan from Thermal <em>Industries</em> to PTNM for US$3m. I have already explained
                        (above at [287]) that apart from the US$740,000 obtained directly from MEC,
                        PTNM never received this US$3m sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    Notwithstanding the desire on the part of
                    the management to treat the “loan” as coming from Thermal
                        <em>Industries</em>, PTNM’s external auditors,
                    Grant Thornton somehow came to label it as coming from Thermal <em>International</em> (which, to be recalled, was the party
                    which directed MEC to advance US$740,000 to PTNM). The transaction was
                    eventually entered into PTNM’s accounts as a loan of US$3m from Thermal
                    International.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The repayments to MEC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    Repayments were subsequently made to MEC for
                    the loan of US$740,000. Two instalments of S$93,746.12 were deducted at source.
                    Six subsequent instalments of S$93,746.12 were paid:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_291-p2_a"></a>(a)     by PTNM to MEC on 22 November
                        2002;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_291-p2_b"></a>(b)     by PTNM
                        to MEC on 27 December 2002;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_291-p2_c"></a>(c)     by Thermal Industries to MEC on 7 March
                        2003;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_291-p2_d"></a>(d)     by
                        Thermal Industries to MEC on 4 April 2003; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_291-p2_e"></a>(e)     by Thermal Industries to MEC on
                        2 August 2003 (two instalments were paid on this
                    date).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The eight instalments of S$93,746.12
                        add up to S$749,968.96. This is presumably less than US$740,000. No
                        elaboration was given on the difference and I shall say no more about
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    As can be seen, Thermal Industries therefore
                    made four of the six above payments amounting to S$374,984.48 to MEC. Since
                    MEC’s loan agreement was with Thermal International and not with PTNM, the
                    four payments made by Thermal Industries to MEC could not logically discharge
                    any indebtedness of PTNM to MEC. PTNM had not borrowed money from MEC, but from
                    Thermal International. However, PTNM’s management appeared to proceed on
                    the assumption that the payments made by Thermal Industries were made on
                    PTNM’s behalf.</p>

                            incorrect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>

                    Thermal Industries. At the same time, PTNM’s debt to Thermal International
                    (purportedly for US$3m) was written down to take into consideration the payments

                    4”. Following this, PTNM made payments of S$100,000 on 5 April 2004

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The novation agreement(s) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    We now move forward to the year 2007 when
                    the Vendors and Columbia were in negotiations over the sale of UMPL’s
                    shares. One of the loose ends that remained was the issue of debts between PTNM
                    and the Thermal Companies. PTNM’s management accounts at the time showed
                    that there were two outstanding long-term loans owed to Thermal International
                    and Thermal Industries (see above at [294] and [297] respectively).
                    Columbia’s case is that it had planned for both of these loans to be
                    novated to UMPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    Rick Evans stated in his AEIC that he had
                    met with the Hongs and Eddie Foo on 31 December 2007 at Albert Hong’s
                    office in Singapore. According to Rick Evans, it was agreed then that the
                    advances in PTNM’s balance sheet for October 2007 were to be assigned to
                        Columbia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> This would,
                    in effect, extinguish PTNM’s debt to Thermal International, and instead,
                    create a debt in favour of Columbia. The agreement and the 31 December 2007
                    meeting was referred to in a letter from Alan Lim to Michael Khoo dated
                    2 January 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> The Hongs denied that any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    On 21 January 2008, Alan Lim wrote to
                    Rick Evans by email, forwarding a draft of the novation agreement to be executed
                    by Thermal International in favour of Columbia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span>
                    The draft novation agreement had no appendices, and the amount of debt to be
                    assigned had been left blank. Alan Lim indicated that he decided to transfer the
                    debt through a novation, rather than an assignment because of stamp duty
                    considerations. He also pointed out that PTNM owed a debt to Thermal Industries,
                    but that this was a short term debt according to PTNM’s audited accounts
                    as at 31 December 2006. He then asked Rick Evans to confirm whether he
                    required the Thermal Industries debt to be novated. Alan Lim was presumably
                    referring to note 20(a) of PTNM’s accounts for 2005 and 2006 (see
                    [297(a)], above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> This debt was apparently in respect
                    of “payments for expenses and advances”, but was not classified as
                    a long-term debt under these accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    Alan Lim’s evidence is that he
                    subsequently discussed the matter with Prem Abraham, who was in charge of
                    Columbia’s finance matters. According to him, Prem Abraham confirmed that
                    the Thermal Industries debt should also be novated, as the “[V]endor[s]

                    and the draft novation agreement were forwarded to Edward Hong on 9 January
                    2008. A further email was sent by Alan Lim to Edward Hong on 18 January
                    2008, in which Alan Lim stated that “the other Novation Agreement
                    pertaining to the other note should be along similar lines”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span>
                    The “other Novation Agreement” presumably referred to the one in
                    respect of Thermal Industries’ debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    On 21 January 2008, the eve of
                    completion, Alan Lim sent another email to MKP. This email appended an amended
                    draft of the novation agreement for the Thermal International debt, and a fresh
                    draft of a novation agreement for the Thermal Industries debt. Both drafts had
                    appendices showing the debts to be novated: the sum of S$273,709 from Thermal
                    Industries, and the sum of US$2,805,504 from Thermal International. The figures
                    were all drawn from PTNM’s management accounts balance sheet for 2007 (see
                    [297(b)] and [294(b)], respectively above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    However, only the Thermal International
                    novation agreement was executed at completion. Alan Lim and Prem Abraham, who
                    were present in Singapore for the completion on 22 January 2008, gave
                    evidence that the novation agreement for the Thermal Industries debt was not
                    executed because Edward Hong informed the Columbia representatives that it was
                    actually a trade debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> According to Prem Abraham, Columbia took Edward
                    Hong’s word that it was a trade debt, and proceeded to complete the sale
                    and purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> Alan Lim said that he advised Prem Abraham
                    that it was safe to go ahead without obtaining a novation agreement for the
                    Thermal Industries debt, as the Hongs were still obligated to discharge all
                    liabilities under the SSA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305"></a>305    In these circumstances, a novation agreement
                    dated 22 January 2008 was entered into between Thermal International, UMPL
                    and PTNM in respect of the Thermal International debts. No similar agreement was
                    executed in respect of the Thermal Industries debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the debt was owed by PTNM to Thermal Industries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_306"></a>306    For what it professed to be a simple and
                    undisputed debt, Thermal Industries’ pleadings evolved greatly over the
                    course of these proceedings. This proved confusing for reasons which I will
                    elaborate on in the next section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_307"></a>307    In the initial statement of claim filed by
                    Thermal Industries, the sum of S$272,934.48 was stated to be the balance of sums
                    paid by Thermal Industries, on PTNM’s behalf, to discharge PTNM’s
                    indebtedness to DVI. This was subsequently amended to read “PTNM’s
                    indebtedness to MEC”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> The sum of S$272,934.48 was derived by adding
                    $10,000 claimed for the defective second-hand servers to the S$262,934.48
                    referred to at [261] above. Thermal Industries’ latest statement of claim
                    stated that PTNM was indebted to it in the sum of S$262,934.48, being the
                    balance of monies advanced by it as a loan to PTNM. It stated that Thermal
                    Industries paid S$374,984.48 “to MEC on PTNM’s behalf” but
                    was silent as to which party PTNM’s debt is owed to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_308"></a>308    In the latest amendment of Thermal
                    Industries’ reply and defence to counterclaim (almost four years after
                    commencing this suit), Thermal Industries alleged for the first time that the
                    payments were made by Thermal Industries to “assist [PTNM] to meet its
                    loan service commitments to Thermal <em>International</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> According to Thermal Industries,
                    “the repayment of the US$740,000 to Thermal International may be effected
                    by direct repayments to MEC by or on behalf of [PTNM], and that such payments
                    are valid in going towards discharging [PTNM’s] repayment obligations to
                    Thermal International.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> It is alleged that sometime in 2002,
                    Edward Hong and Boelio Muliadi orally agreed to have PTNM pay MEC directly,
                    rather than have PTNM pay Thermal International, who would in turn pay
                        MEC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_309"></a>309    PTNM and Columbia pleaded that the sum of
                    US$740,000, which formed part of the loan amount of US$3m advanced by MEC to
                    Thermal International, could only be conceived of as a loan from Thermal
                    International to PTNM. PTNM admitted to repaying two instalments to MEC on
                    22 November 2002 and 27 December 2002 respectively. But PTNM alleged
                    that these payments could only be conceived as loan repayments to MEC on behalf
                    of Thermal International. These were therefore loan repayments by PTNM to
                    Thermal International.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> Since
                    PTNM had no indebtedness to MEC, Thermal Industries could not have made any
                    payment to MEC on PTNM’s behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> The loan amount of US$3m from
                    MEC to Thermal International, from which US$740,000 was paid to PTNM, was
                    recorded in PTNM’s audited accounts as a loan for US$3m from Thermal
                    International to PTNM. This loan was subsequently novated from Thermal
                    International to UMPL by a novation agreement dated 22 January
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_310"></a>310    Due to the various changes in the pleadings
                    of Thermal Industries and the convoluted evidence about the debt, there was much
                    confusion on the part of various witnesses as to which of the Thermal Companies
                    should be treated as the lender of US$740,000 to PTNM. Since the loan of
                    US$740,000 was advanced to PTNM on the instructions of Thermal International out
                    of the US$3m loan it had received from MEC, the correct approach ought to be to
                    treat Thermal International as the lender of the funds. However, as elaborated
                    above, there was evidence that at the material time the payments to MEC were
                    made, Thermal Industries was treated by the management of PTNM as the lending
                    entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_311"></a>311    On balance, it seems to me that even if the
                    debt had initially been owed by PTNM to Thermal International, the creditor was
                    substituted so that Thermal Industries became the creditor in place of Thermal
                    International. This was done with the agreement of PTNM which was controlled by
                    the Hongs at the relevant time. Indeed, PTNM recorded Thermal Industries as the
                    creditor. Therefore, I grant judgment in favour of Thermal Industries against
                    PTNM for S$262,934.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for the debt PTNM
                owed to Thermal Industries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_312"></a>312    Columbia raised two arguments in the event
                    that I find PTNM liable to Thermal Industries for the sum claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_313"></a>313    First, Columbia argued that the debt was one
                    properly borne by the Hongs under s 8.4.1 of the SSA. These provisions
                    obliged the Hongs to hold Columbia harmless against loss arising from a breach
                    of any term of the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_314"></a>314    Columbia argued that the Hongs were in
                    breach of ss 3.1 and 3.4 of the SSA. Section 3.1 provided that the
                    Sale Shares were to be purchased “free from all ... Liabilities
                    ...”. Section 3.4 provided that the purchase price was to be applied
                    towards “full and final settlement of the Liabilities” before
                    being released to the Vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_315"></a>315    Columbia argued that the debt owed to
                    Thermal Industries fell within the term “Liabilities”.
                    “Liabilities” is defined in s 2.1.24 of the SSA as
                    “all and any present or future liabilities or obligations ... of PTNM ...
                    excluding the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness, all obligations to trade vendors and
                    doctors that are a part of the day to day operations of PTNM ...”.
                    Section 3.4 of the SSA thus required the debt to Thermal Industries be
                    discharged before the purchase price was released to the Vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_316"></a>316    Columbia asserted that the Vendors had
                    breached ss 3.1 and 3.4 of the SSA by making representations that the
                    Liabilities had been discharged, despite the fact that the Thermal Industries
                    debt had not been paid. Columbia thus asserted that it was entitled to an
                    indemnity from the Vendors under s 8.4.1 of the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_317"></a>317    Columbia’s second argument was that
                    Thermal Industries was the agent, nominee or alter ego of Edward Hong. Thermal
                    Industries was accordingly precluded from seeking recovery, since Edward Hong
                    had agreed under ss 2.1, 3.1 and 3.4 of the SSA that neither PTNM nor
                    Columbia shall be responsible for the debts to the Thermal
                Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_318"></a>318    I will deal with the second argument first.
                    I reject it. There are two separate questions. The first is whether PTNM owes
                    the sum in issue to Thermal Industries. Whether Edward Hong owns Thermal
                    Industries is another matter which does not preclude Thermal Industries from
                    making the claim. As for Columbia’s first argument, it carried more
                    weight. Yet it is possible that even if PTNM owes the sum to Thermal Industries,
                    the Hongs are not liable to indemnify Columbia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_319"></a>319    The Hongs’ defence to Columbia’s
                    claim for an indemnity has shifted almost completely since the start of these
                    proceedings. In their initial third-party defence, the Hongs pleaded that they
                    as vendors had complied with all their obligations under the SSA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> They pleaded that the debt to Thermal Industries
                    was excluded from the definition of “Liabilities” in s 2.1.24
                    of the SSA in that it was part of the “Goldman Sachs Indebtedness”
                    and/or part of the “day to day operations of [PTNM].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> As such, the debt was not part of the
                    liabilities which the Hongs had to meet under the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_320"></a>320    In the third amendment to their defence, the
                    Hongs pleaded for the first time that due to “grammatical and
                    phraseological errors”, the definition of “Liabilities” in
                    s 2.1.24 of the SSA should be rectified to exclude “debts between
                    [Thermal Industries] and [Thermal International] on the one hand, and [UMPL]
                    and/or [PTNM] on the other”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_321"></a>321    In the latest amendment of their defence,
                    the Hongs position shifted again. They pleaded that s 2.1.24 was wrongly
                    included in the SSA because the intention of the parties was that PTNM’s
                    liabilities should, and had already been factored into the actual purchase
                        price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> In support of
                    this latest proposition, the Hongs’ defence referred to Rick Evans’
                    visit to Medan on 1 December 2007, whereby he proposed to reduce the agreed
                    purchase price of US$31m by US$841,000 to take into account the current
                    liabilities of PTNM. According to the Hongs, this meant that they were no longer
                    responsible for any further liability (whether current or otherwise), and this
                    was the basis of the SSA. They accordingly asked for s 2.1.24 of the SSA to
                    be expunged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_322"></a>322    In the alternative, the Hongs also pleaded
                    that “even if ... section 2.1.24 was intended to be included in the
                    S&amp;P Agreement, its actual contents do not represent the intention of the
                    parties”. The Hongs therefore sought an order rectifying s 2.1.24 of
                    the SSA so that it reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Liabilities means all and any present or future liabilities or
                        obligations of [UMPL] and [PTNM] whether actual, contingent or otherwise
                        whatsoever, (excluding the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness, all obligations to
                        trade vendors and doctors that are part of the day to day operation of
                        [PTNM], and the <del>inter-company debts between
                            [UMPL] and [PTNM]</del> debts between <b>[Thermal
                            Industries] and [Thermal International] on the one hand, and [UMPL]
                            and/or [PTNM] on the other</b>) incurred by [UMPL] and/or [PTNM],
                        up to and including the Completion Date.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Hongs were seeking to remove the struck-through words, and
                        introduce the words in bold through rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether s 2.1.24 of the SSA should be expunged or
                rectified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_323"></a>323    The Hongs reliance on Rick Evans’
                    agreement to the reduction of the actual purchase price is misplaced. As seen
                    above (at [48] and [49]), Columbia was of the view that the excess of current
                    liabilities over current assets was something that was to be borne by <em>the Vendors</em>. Even then, Columbia agreed to bear
                    US$500,000 of the US$841,000 sum but this did not mean that Columbia was waiving
                    its right in respect of non-current liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_324"></a>324    In my view, the Hongs’ rectification
                    defence was a last-ditch attempt to evade liability under the SSA and was
                    contradicted by the objective facts. The documentary evidence showed
                    unequivocally that the parties had agreed that the sale of the Sale Shares would
                    take place with <em>current</em> assets and liabilities
                        equalised,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> with all other liabilities to borne by the
                    Vendors. This was a constant thread which ran through the parties’
                    negotiations, including both conditional offers made by Rick Evans and the SFA
                    signed by the parties on 1 December 2007. There was no objective evidence
                    that the parties intended to free the Hongs from all liabilities
                    whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_325"></a>325    The SFA which was signed on 1 December 2007
                    provided that the Vendors would deliver UMPL “free and clear of all ...
                    debts”, and that PTNM would be delivered “free and clear of all
                    ... debts ... save for ... obligations to trade vendors and doctors that are
                    part of the day to day operations ... and ... debts owed to UMPL”. This
                    was eventually captured in s 2.1.24 of the SSA. The SFA therefore clearly
                    provided that the vendors were responsible for all liabilities of UMPL and PTNM,
                    with the exception of PTNM’s current liabilities (which had already been
                    factored into the reduced price insofar as they were not supported by current
                    assets) and debts owed by PTNM to UMPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_326"></a>326    In fact Eddie Foo admitted in
                    cross-examination that this was the “literal interpretation” of
                    the SFA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> Having been forced to concede this, he then
                    claimed that the SFA also did not reflect the intention of the
                        parties,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> and that the Hongs were taking out an
                    application to rectify the SFA as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> This claim
                    was inconsistent with his other evidence that the SFA was compatible with his
                        stance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> It was also inconsistent with the fact that the
                    Hongs did not apply to rectify the SFA; the Hongs’ existing defence only
                    sought a rectification of the SSA and not the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_327"></a>327    The Hongs attempted to rely on an email from
                    Eddie Foo to Rick Evans dated 29 November 2007 to show that the transaction
                    was intended to be on an “as is where is” basis in relation to
                    PTNM’s liabilities. The following is an extract from the email in
                    question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Outstanding Doctors’ Fees but Assets and
                            Liabilities of UM &amp; PTNM in General</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We feel that this should also be on a “as-is-where-is” basis
                        and insofar as it has already been disclosed, has also already been factored
                        into the agreed transaction price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>However, this was merely a proposal to Rick Evans, and it was
                        not reflected in either the SFA or the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_328"></a>328    The Hongs’ assertion that the
                    definition of “Liabilities” had been wrongly included in the SSA
                    was without merit. The SSA was drafted with the input of both sides’
                    solicitors. As mentioned above, Alan Lim had drafted four drafts of the SSA but
                    only the second and fourth drafts were circulated to the Vendors. In the second
                    draft, dated 25 November 2007, the definition of
                    “Liabilities” had no exclusions. This was changed in the fourth
                    draft, where three exclusions were inserted: (a) the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness;
                    (b) all obligations to trade vendors and doctors that are a part of the day to
                    day operation of PTNM; and (c) the inter-company debts between UMPL and
                    PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_329"></a>329    On 6 December 2007, MKP wrote back by
                    email at 8.58am with proposed amendments after having taken instructions. MKP
                    was principally concerned with the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness and the only
                    amendment they proposed in relation to the definition of
                    “Liabilities” was to exclude the reference to the Goldman Sachs
                    Indebtedness. By another email on the same day, MKP sent further suggested
                    amendments to the fourth draft of the SSA. Their proposed definition of
                    Liabilities appeared to be simply “all and any present or future
                    liabilities or obligations”. All three exceptions to the definition were
                    taken out, presumably so that the Vendors would be responsible for all the
                    liabilities of the company, without qualification. On 7 December 2007, the
                    solicitors from both sides worked to finalise the SSA, and it was thereafter
                    signed by the Vendors in its present form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_330"></a>330    The Hongs’ contention that
                    s 2.1.24 was mistakenly included in the SSA, and their attempt to now
                    distance themselves from the SSA, are unmeritorious. The intention of the
                    parties was clearly that non-current liabilities were to be the Hongs’
                    responsibility, unless specifically excluded by the SSA. Indeed, the evidence
                    shows that Columbia planned for the present debt to be novated from Thermal
                    Industries to UMPL and even drafted a novation agreement to this effect. This
                    novation agreement was not signed due to Edward Hong’s incorrect position
                    that the debt was a trade debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_331"></a>331    In these circumstances, I reject the
                    Hongs’ claim to expunge or rectify s 2.1.24 of the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether debts owed to Thermal Industries fall within the scope of the
                indemnity under the SSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_332"></a>332    To recap, section 2.1.24 of the SSA provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.1.24    
              <u>Liabilities</u>
                            means all and any present or future liabilities or obligations of [UMPL]
                            and [PTNM] whether actual, contingent, or otherwise) whatsoever
                            (excluding the Goldman Sachs Indebtedness, all obligations to trade
                            vendors and doctors that are a part of the day to day operation of
                            [PTNM], and the inter-company debts between [UMPL] and the [PTNM])
                            incurred by the [UMPL] and/or the [PTNM] less the current assets of the
                            [PTNM], up to and include the Completion Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_333"></a>333    Under s 3.1 of the SSA, the Hongs
                    agreed to sell the sale shares “free from all Encumbrances and
                    Liabilities whatsoever”. Under s 3.4.1 of the SSA, the Hongs’
                    solicitors were to release the Deposit Sum and Balance Purchase Price
                    “firstly, towards full and final settlement of the Liabilities”.
                    Finally, under s 8.4.1 of the SSA, the Hongs undertook to indemnify
                    Columbia against all losses, liabilities, judgments and costs incurred by the
                    latter arising out of any breach of any term or condition of the
                SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_334"></a>334    On a plain reading of the SSA, any debt owed
                    by PTNM to Thermal Industries would be a liability the Hongs were responsible
                    for, unless it fell within one of the exceptions in s 2.1.24 of the SSA. In
                    the present case, Thermal Industries’ claim is clearly not in respect of
                    an “inter-company debt between [UMPL] and [PTNM]”. It also does
                    not fall under the exception of “all obligations to trade vendors and
                    doctors that are part of the day to day operation of [PTNM]”. Whilst
                    Thermal Industries did on occasion act as PTNM’s supplier in the past, it
                    did not allege that this particular sum of S$262,934.48 was in respect of the
                    “day to day operation” of PTNM. Indeed, Eddie Foo admitted in his
                    cross-examination that the debt owed to Thermal Industries was not a trade
                        debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_335"></a>335    It is therefore clear that under the SSA,
                    the obligation for discharging the alleged debt to Thermal Industries lay with
                    the Hongs. The Hongs are therefore liable under s 8.4.1 of the SSA to
                    indemnify Columbia for the S$262,934.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether PTNM is liable for the second-hand servers supplied by
                Thermal Industries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_336"></a>336    Thermal Industries also claimed S$10,000 for
                    the second-hand servers supplied by them to PTNM. Prem Abraham asserted that
                    these servers were defective and unusable from the time they were
                        delivered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> However, this appeared to be a bare
                    allegation based on what Prem Abraham was allegedly told by employees of the
                    Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_337"></a>337    The burden of proof lies on Columbia to
                    establish this allegation. I conclude that it has failed to do so. Furthermore,
                    I am of the view that the servers come within the exception of obligations to
                    trade vendors for which the Hongs are not liable. Therefore, PTNM is liable to
                    pay Thermal Industries S$10,000 for the servers and the Hongs need not indemnify
                    Columbia for this liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Suit 862</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_338"></a>338    In Suit 862, Thermal International made
                    various claims against PTNM. Thermal International claimed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_338-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$393,399.70 which was the balance
                        owing for an MRI machine that Thermal International supplied to
                    PTNM;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_338-p2_b"></a>(b)     S$3,320 for
                        supplies from Thermal International to PTNM; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_338-p2_c"></a>(c)     US$9,763 for supplies from Thermal
                        International to PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_339"></a>339    PTNM did not dispute liability in respect of
                    the sums in [338(b)] and [338(c)]. In respect of the sum in [338(a)],
                    PTNM’s position was less clear. In its defence in Suit 862, PTNM denied
                    liability for the sum. This was a bare denial with no further elaboration. Prem
                    Abraham’s AEIC, however, stated that “the claim for any payment
                    under [the] sale and purchase [of the MRI machine] is time barred”. Yet
                    in closing submissions, PTNM did not appear to deny liability for this sum. I
                    will deal with the limitation point later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_340"></a>340    In the event that PTNM was found to be
                    liable for the three sums, Columbia sought an indemnity from the Hongs under the
                    SSA for those sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_341"></a>341    Columbia and PTNM also made a counterclaim
                    in unjust enrichment against Thermal International. This was for the sum of
                    S$144,046.03 which PTNM paid to Thermal International on 27 May 2008. This
                    payment was made by PTNM for a Philips angiography machine which Thermal
                    International supplied to PTNM. It was unclear from the pleadings and
                    submissions which party was making the counterclaim: PTNM, Columbia, or both.
                    Presumably the counterclaim was brought by PTNM because it was the entity that
                    made the payment. I will refer only to PTNM in respect of the
                    counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_342"></a>342    PTNM alleged that it was “under no
                    legal obligation” to pay for the equipment, and that it had
                    “mistakenly” made the payment because it “did not realise
                    the position under the terms of the SSA”. PTNM’s case was that the
                    sum paid fell within “Liabilities” under s 2.1.24 of the SSA,
                    as it was not a debt due to a trade vendor. They argued that therefore,
                        <em>the Vendors</em> and not <em>PTNM</em> would have been liable for the sum. PTNM’s payment of
                    the sum was therefore made pursuant to a mistake, which resulted in the unjust
                    enrichment of Thermal International.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_343"></a>343    PTNM’s argument on this point was
                    puzzling. Even assuming that the sum due for the Philips angiography machine
                    fell within “Liabilities” under s 2.1.24 of the SSA,
                    PTNM’s payment to Thermal International would not have been mistaken. PTNM
                    would still have been obliged to make the payment in discharge of a liability it
                    owed to Thermal International. The SSA did not extinguish PTNM’s debt to
                    Thermal International (both of whom were not parties to the SSA). The terms of
                    the SSA would merely have entitled Columbia to claim an indemnity from the Hongs
                    for a breach of warranty. However, Columbia did not claim an indemnity from the
                    Hongs in respect of this sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of relevant facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_344"></a>344    Sometime in early October 2002, Thermal
                    International shipped an MRI machine to PTNM for use in the Hospital. An invoice
                    for the machine in the sum of S$656,000 was issued on 10 October 2002. It was
                    not disputed that PTNM made payments for the MRI machine amounting to
                    S$262,600.30 between June and December 2007. This left a balance of
                    S$393,399.70. This balance formed the first of the three sums Thermal Industries
                    claimed in Suit 862.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_345"></a>345    I pause parenthetically to note that even if
                    PTNM had taken up the limitation point in pleadings and submissions (which it
                    did not), the payments made by PTNM to Thermal International between June and
                    December 2007 would have amounted to an affirmation of the debt. As such, the
                    limitation period would have re-started from the date the last of these payments
                    was made: 12 December 2007. Accordingly, the writ of summons for Suit 862,
                    which was filed on 20 November 2008, would have been within the limitation
                    period for the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_346"></a>346    As regards the claim against the Hongs for
                    an indemnity, I reiterate that PTNM has no standing to enforce the provisions of
                    the SSA (see [267]–[283] above). Only Columbia has standing to maintain
                    such a claim against the Hongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for the sums
                claimed in Suit 862</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_347"></a>347    As seen from above, the real question was
                    not whether PTNM was liable for the sums claimed by Thermal International, but
                    whether the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for the sums claimed, on the
                    basis that PTNM was liable for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether s 2.1.24 of the SSA should be expunged or
                rectified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_348"></a>348    It follows from my decision in Suit 861 (at
                    [323]–[331] above) that s 2.1.24 is not to be expunged or
                    rectified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether sums due for the MRI machine, the supplies, and the Philips
                angiography machine fall within the scope of the indemnity under the SSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_349"></a>349    The sole question in this issue is whether
                    the MRI machine, the supplies, and the Philips angiography machine fall within
                    one of the exceptions to the definition of “Liabilities” under
                    s 2.1.24 of the SSA: whether the debts are “obligations to trade
                    vendors part of the day to day operation of [PTNM]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_350"></a>350    In relation to the debt for the MRI machine,
                    Columbia argued that it was not an obligation owed to a trade vendor. This was
                    because the MRI machine was a capital item and a fixed asset,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span> as it would
                    depreciate over time. The debt was consequently a “Liability”
                    under s 2.1.24 of the SSA, for which the Hongs are properly responsible. It
                    is to be recalled that under s 3.1 of the SSA, the Hongs had agreed to sell
                    the sale shares “free from all Encumbrances and Liabilities
                    whatsoever”. Under s 8.4.1 of the SSA, the Vendors are liable for
                    all losses and liabilities flowing from their breach of any condition or
                    warranty given under the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_351"></a>351    The Hongs’ position was that the debt
                    was a trade debt. In particular, Eddie Foo took the position that the MRI
                    machine was not a fixed asset as it was used in the day to day operation of the
                    Hospital to generate income. However, when confronted with the analogy that the
                    entire hospital building was used on a “day to day” basis, Eddie
                    Foo appeared to agree that the cost of supplying that building would not
                    constitute a trade debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_352"></a>352    Nevertheless, I am of the view that a sale
                    of the Hospital building or the Land is not necessarily the same thing as a sale
                    of the MRI machine. There was no dispute that Thermal International had sold the
                    MRI machine to PTNM in the normal course of business of Thermal International. I
                    am of the view that the debt to Thermal International therefore comes within an
                    exception to the definition of “Liabilities” in the SSA as an
                    obligation to a trade vendor. Contrary to the arguments made by Columbia, it
                    matters not whether the debt is treated as a long-term or a current debt in the
                    books of PTNM or whether the MRI machine is depreciated over a long period of
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_353"></a>353    I therefore find that the Hongs are not
                    liable under s 8.4.1 of the SSA to indemnify Columbia for the sum of
                    S$393,399.70.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_354"></a>354    For the same reasons, I find that the Hongs
                    are not liable to indemnify Columbia for the sums of S$3,320 and US$9,763 which
                    were for supplies used for the day to day operation of the
                Hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_355"></a>355    As I mentioned above, PTNM’s
                    counterclaim of S$144,046.03 for payment for the Philips angiography machine on
                    the basis of mistake is unfounded. Columbia did not seek an indemnity from the
                    Hongs for the sum paid. However, even if Columbia had done so, I would have
                    concluded that the amount paid for the Philips angiography machine is an amount
                    paid to a trade vendor for the reasons I have given in respect of the MRI
                    machine. It therefore does not fall within “Liabilities” under
                    s 2.1.24 of the SSA, and the Hong’s are not liable to indemnify
                    Columbia for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_356"></a>356    In conclusion, for Suit 964:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_356-p2_a"></a>(a)     I grant Columbia judgment against
                        the Hongs for damages to be assessed for the reasonable costs of taking
                        measures to remove the MEC Charge from the land title certificate. The
                        assessment of such costs is to be conducted by me or another judge
                        (including a judicial commissioner) of the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_356-p2_b"></a>(b)     I declare that the Hongs are liable
                        to indemnify Columbia for any claim by DVI in relation to the transfer of
                        the DVI Shares, including reasonable costs of defending any claim that DVI
                        may bring against Columbia and/or PTNM.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_356-p2_c"></a>(c)     In respect of the Tax Indemnity Issue,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_356-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       I order the Hongs to
                            indemnify Columbia for the sum of IDR 7,027,522,992 being the additional
                            taxes that were paid to the ITA in respect of the years 2004 to 2007;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_356-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       I also declare that the Hongs are liable to indemnify Columbia for any
                            future tax assessments on PTNM for the period before 22 January
                            2008, as well as any penalties which may be imposed and/or any
                            reasonable costs (including legal costs) which may be incurred in
                            dealing with any investigation and/or prosecution by the tax
                            authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_357"></a>357    In Suit 861, I grant Thermal Industries
                    judgment against PTNM for S$262,934.48 and for S$10,000. However, I also order
                    the Hongs to indemnify Columbia for the sum of S$262,934.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_358"></a>358    In Suit 862:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_358-p2_a"></a>(a)     I grant Thermal International
                        judgment for S$393,399.70, S$3,320 and US$9,763.00 against
                    PTNM;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_358-p2_b"></a>(b)     I dismiss
                        the claim by Columbia (and PTNM) for an indemnity from the Hongs for these
                        three sums; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_358-p2_c"></a>(c)     I dismiss the counterclaim by PTNM for S$144,046.03 against Thermal
                        International.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_359"></a>359    There was no submission on the interest rate
                    or the date from which the interest is to run. To avoid unnecessary
                    complication, I will grant one rate of interest and the interest will start to
                    run from one date. I order that interest be paid on any sum already ascertained,
                    and which I have ordered to be paid, at the rate of 5.33% per annum from
                    11 November 2009, being the date when the last of the three actions was
                    filed. This is not unfair to the Hongs as they are likely to end up paying more
                    than what the Thermal Companies are entitled to receive from PTNM under my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_360"></a>360    I will hear the parties on costs at a later
                    date after the amount of the reasonable costs of taking measures to remove the
                    MEC Charge from the land title certificate is determined by the court or agreed
                    between the Hongs and Columbia.</p>
