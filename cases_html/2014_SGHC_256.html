</div> The Husband argues that there was no reason for the DJ to limit his contribution in the light of the documentary evidence that he provided.

The Wife argues that the DJ was wrong to disregard the handwritten bank withdrawal slips. She states that handwritten bank withdrawal slips were common practice in India. In any event, the Wife obtained typewritten confirmation of the handwritten withdrawal slips from the bank from which the withdrawals were made.

The Wife submits that the DJ took the Husband’s CPF contributions to the flat as at 20 January 2014, but took the Wife’s CPF contributions as at 23 August 2012. The Wife argues that the DJ should have taken her CPF contribution as that on 22 January 2014 because that would have been a more accurate assessment date.

He took reference, however, from the rule in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> (1954) 1 WLR 1489 (“<span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>, Denning LJ (as he then was) stated at 1491 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... To justify the reception of fresh evidence… three conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; thirdly, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">ACU v ACR, </span>Woo J considered that the fresh evidence would not have satisfied the first criterion of the three-part test. He nonetheless found that the second and third criteria would have been satisfied. He therefore allowed the evidence to be introduced.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The Wife’s summons</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Wife seeks to introduce documents pursuant to her summons for further evidence. These documents fall into three categories:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) typewritten bank confirmation slips matching handwritten receipts of withdrawals from an Indian bank which were rejected by the DJ; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a certificate on the state of her health; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) documents showing her legal bills.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27  The first is the typewritten confirmations of the handwritten withdrawal slips that the DJ rejected. These typewritten withdrawal slips are endorsed with the stamp of the Indian bank that issued the handwritten withdrawal slips, and certify the withdrawals recorded in the handwritten withdrawal slips. These are said to be relevant to establishing her cash contributions to [Property 1] and [Property 2].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I recognise that the typewritten confirmation slips could have been produced at the hearing before the DJ. It therefore fails the first of the three limbs in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>. But that alone is not an impediment to me allowing it to be introduced, as <span class="font-italic">ACU v ACR</span> shows. On the other hand, the typewritten confirmation slips are of great importance to an issue raised in the appeals. The “unusual” nature of handwritten withdrawal slips was the DJ’s sole basis for dismissing what could otherwise have been proof of substantial cash contributions to the purchase of both [Property 1] and [Property 2] by the Wife. The Wife, on her part, explained in her affidavit that it was common in India to have handwritten records. The typewritten withdrawal slips would be crucial to a resolution of that issue, as they lend credibility to the contentions that the withdrawals had been made. The typewritten slips were endorsed by UCO Bank in India, the bank from which the withdrawals were made. The Husband does not contest the authenticity or reliability of the typewritten confirmation slips: his issue was with the nexus to the money held in his accounts. For these reasons, I allow the typewritten bank slips to be adduced in evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The second category of evidence the Wife seeks to introduce, in order to bolster her appeal on the maintenance awarded, is a medical certificate issued by Dr Rishi Arya in India which states that the Wife is a “chronic asthmatic” which requires her to be on “regular medication to continue leading a normal daily routine”.

</div> The medical certificate does not give any indication as to what kind of medication her condition requires, and the expense she would be put to on account of such medication. No diagnosis as to the underlying cause or severity of the condition is given. I therefore dismiss her application to introduce the medical certificate into the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The third and final category of evidence the Wife seeks to introduce are documents showing the extent of her legal fees incurred in the divorce proceedings, also in support of her appeal to raise the maintenance award.

The first category of evidence relates to the Husband’s argument that the Chesterton report should not be relied upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Husband’s application in respect of the first category of evidence will require me to set out in some detail his contentions as to the factual background. At the hearing of the ancillary matters in the District Court, a valuation report dated 24 January 2014 produced by M/s Goh Leong Valuers (“GLV”) had been adduced by the Wife and accepted by the Husband. The GLV report placed the value of [Property 1] at $770,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Husband’s version of events is that, at the adjourned date at which he expected delivery of judgment, the DJ showed him a printout of recent transactions in the area around [Property 1]. He did not notice that these were flats on higher floors. The DJ was of the view that another valuation ought to be made. The Wife’s solicitors proposed a revaluation of the property, and put forward a list of valuation firms which could carry out the revaluation of [Property 1]. The Husband, who appeared in person at the ancillary matters before the DJ, said he was pressed and selected Chesterton out of the list of property valuers. The DJ therefore ordered that [Property 1] be valued by Chesterton. The Chesterton valuation report, dated 14 May 2014, placed the value of [Property 1] at $860,000.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Husband, in his substantive appeal, argues that the Chesterton report should be disregarded. He argues that he felt compelled to accept the Chesterton valuation under pressure from the Wife’s solicitors and the DJ. He also points to the fact that Chesterton is not an HDB-approved valuer. Finally, he argues that, in any event, the Chesterton report is unreliable and that the GLV valuation report is to be preferred. On her part, the Wife does not dispute the Husband’s account but reminds in her reply affidavit that the Husband agreed to the second valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The evidence the Husband seeks to adduce supports each of these links in the chain of his argument that the Chesterton report should be rejected.

</div> (a) print-outs indicating the prices of property in the area around [Property 1]; (b) the Husband’s handwritten notes of the names of five property valuers from which he chose Chesterton; (c) the Chesterton report; (d) emails between the Husband and Chesterton confirming that the latter is not an HDB-approved valuer; (e) a print-out from the HDB website purportedly showing that HDB requires approved valuers for the valuation of HDB flats; and (f) emails between the Husband and the Wife’s solicitors showing that the Wife agreed to the GLV valuation prior to the DJ’s order that [Property 1] be valued by Chesterton. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I allow the Husband’s further evidence on this point as it is quite material to his case that an HDB-approved valuer should be used. While the Wife makes the point that it is not crucial to have an HDB-approved valuer, this is necessary for purposes of seeking financing, and it would be reasonable to assume that the Husband would require some refinancing of his mortgage now that the Wife was no longer contributing. The DJ probably ought not to have made the order for a second valuation, especially one not by an HDB-approved valuer. There was already in evidence a relatively current valuation done by GLV in January 2014. There is nothing to suggest that the GLV valuation was defective or unreliable and was accepted for use by both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Of course, the Husband had an opportunity to raise his dissatisfaction with the DJ’s order that Chesterton value the flat when parties appeared before the DJ for further arguments (at the Husband’s request) on 21 April 2014. He was not recorded to have done so. It was only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Chesterton produced the report, which turned in the Wife’s favour, that the Husband raised a host of objections to it.

</div>. This is in response to the Wife’s argument that those deposits show that he was receiving cash gifts from the Wife’s family. The Husband seeks to explain these deposits with documentary proof that he had taken various short term loans which account for the in-flow of cash into his bank account. I am of the view that the relevance of these documents to this appeal is low. Looking at the records, many of the cash withdrawals that the Wife is relying on are neither referable in quantum nor time to the Husband’s deposits. In the light of my finding in respect of the Wife’s contentions, it follows that the source of those deposits is also of little relevance.

His claim for contribution to furnishing, which is one of the categories forming part of the larger composite sum, is stated to be $30,735.56. The Husband has, however, only produced documentary proof for the purchase of furniture up to the value of $15,135.56. The remaining sum of $15,600 remains unsubstantiated; it is merely itemised with generic descriptions and approximate prices.

</div> The date of purchase of [Property 2] coincided with the period which the Husband was out of a job. The Wife was not employed at that point in time.

I respectfully do not agree that there is a basis for that conclusion. Apart from the Wife’s bare allegation that the monies were paid in response to the Husband’s demands for the payment of a dowry, there is nothing otherwise to suggest that the sums transferred to the couple were payments made illegally or under the inducement of threat. Further, the Husband strenuously denies making any such threats against the Wife or her family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 While I may accept that the Wife received the sums stated in the first two items as gifts from her family, I am not satisfied that the second inference should be drawn in relation to them. The sums of money were given to the Wife close to a year before [Property 2] was purchased. I do not think that they would have been applied directly to the purchase of the property.

Of course, as discussed at [43] above, there is no automatic nexus between the withdrawals and the payment into [Property 2]. These withdrawals, however, provide an explanation for the source of the Wife’s funds from which her contended contribution of $3,000 was made, which the DJ accepted.

</div> In view of the corroborating evidence, I am prepared to accept that this in fact occurred. However, in view of the significant elapse of time between these withdrawals and the purchase of [Property 1], as well as the nature in which these sums are said to be contributions to [Property 1], I am of the view that they are more properly considered as part of the Wife’s indirect contributions rather than direct financial contributions to [Property 1].  While the Wife contends that the Husband agreed that the sum could be counted as the Wife’s contribution to [Property 1], in the absence of other contemporaneous evidence on the same, it would be better to use the position at law, which is that it is not considered in the nature of a direct contribution to the payment of the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is not clear what documentary proof the DJ relied on in accepting the Wife’s assertion that she contributed the second item. The Wife’s submissions also did not connect that amount to any documentary evidence. The date and the sum in question, however, appear to correspond to a sum of $8,333.33 allegedly loaned by [E], the Wife’s father’s first cousin, on 17 August 2010 to the Wife’s father for the Wife’s use.

The basis of the Wife’s contention is a bank withdrawal slip showing a $70,000 withdrawal from the Husband’s bank account on 5 September 2011.

</div> The Husband explained that this money had been taken out to repay the loans he had taken earlier for the flat, and also to protect his savings because he was fearful of her relatives.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This contention is related to the Wife’s earlier contention that her relatives had contributed $70,000 which the Husband must have banked into his account. In the analysis above, I have accepted some of these alleged contributions but not others. Of significance is the fact that the time periods for the cash injections into the Husband’s account

</div> show no discernible connection to the timing or the amount of the various alleged contributions from the Wife’s family members. The Husband, on his part, explained that the earlier injections were loans taken out for the purposes of the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Whilst the Husband’s account had a lot of activity, there was no evidence (aside from that which I have already accepted) that his account comprised any assets built up by both parties jointly. It bears mention that prior to the marriage, the Husband was earning a substantial salary from his previous employers, JPMorgan Chase Bank and Credit Suisse. The DJ did not make any finding as to this alleged dissipation of assets by the Husband, and I similarly reject the contention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Indirect contributions and division of asset</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The DJ did not place any weight on the indirect contributions of the parties. The DJ noted that the marriage was a short and childless one. The indirect contributions asserted by both parties were strenuously denied by the other. Both parties were working full-time for most of the marriage. Both were traditional Indians who believed in the sanctity of marriage; each would have made efforts to make the marriage work as divorce would bring shame to them and their families. The DJ concluded that the indirect contributions made by either party would have cancelled out the other party’s indirect contributions. The DJ nevertheless decided to round up the Wife’s share in [Property 1] (from 21% to 25%) because “if not for the marriage, the parties would not be able to form the family nucleus required to purchase [an] HDB flat and make a profit from it”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This last statement was objected to by the Husband, who criticised the “rounding up” and its rationale. The fact of the family nucleus and its attendant entitlement to an HDB flat was a privilege enjoyed by both parties, and I accept that it ought not to be dealt with in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It would be useful, at this juncture, to take reference from the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 where husband and wife were married for three years and without children. The Court of Appeal stated at [28] that “[i]n a short and childless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions as non-financial contributions will be minimal”. The Court of Appeal apportioned 64% of the share of the property to the husband and 36% to the wife in line with their direct financial contribution to the property, which was in the ratio 64:36.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 More recently, in <span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1320 (“<span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span>”), the court considered the division of assets in a childless marriage of three years. As far as the division of assets was concerned, the only item in dispute was a property located in the United Kingdom. The property was purchased after the marriage and held in the joint names of the husband and wife. George Wei JC established that the wife’s direct financial contribution to the property, taken at its highest, amounted to only 4% the value of the property. He therefore rejected the wife’s position that she was entitled to a 25% share in the property. Wei JC awarded her a 5% share in the property. In doing so, Wei JC bore in mind “the emphasis of the law on direct financial contributions in short childless marriages” (<span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span> at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Viewing this case in the broader context of the cases I mention, in my view, the DJ was correct not to place too much weight on the indirect contributions of the parties. I accept that generally, both the Husband and the Wife equally tried to make the marriage work. The division should therefore not stray too far from the financial contributions of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 However, viewing the marriage broadly, I think it is appropriate to give the Wife a small uplift. The Wife left her native city of Jalandhar in Punjab, India, and uprooted from familiar familial surroundings to marry the Husband and set up a new life in Singapore pursuant to their arranged marriage. I accepted at [47]–[49] and [56] above that the Wife, through gifts from her family, provided some $35,000 in cash. Some of the money was contended to be contribution to the Husband’s extended family, other components must have contributed to the joint expenses and purchases that the Husband and Wife made during their marriage. In viewing these contributions I took into account that the Husband, as the primary earner during much of their marriage, would also have made ongoing contributions of his own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Viewing the various factors in a broad-brush manner, I am of the view that it is just and equitable to divide [Property 1] 85% to the Husband and 15% to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Valuation or sale of Property 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Parties agreed that the Husband would pay the Wife for her share of the flat, with her transfer to the Husband to hold solely. For reasons mentioned at [34]–[36] above, the valuation of $770,000 provided by the GLV report is to be used if parties are able to carry out this option.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Both in the court below and before me, parties assumed that the HDB would allow the Husband to keep the flat. The correspondence shown to me was, however, not definitive on this. Although the Husband is over 35 years of age, only specific categories of flats are specified in that scheme and it was not clear that [Property 1] was within such a category. In the event that the HDB does not allow the transfer, the flat should be sold in the open market when permissible, and the proceeds divided in the shares which I have apportioned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The DJ’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Husband’s net salary is $4,943 whilst the Wife’s net salary is $1,711 (both salaries are reflected here without bonus and overtime payments). The DJ decided that since this was a short childless marriage, a lump sum maintenance order was appropriate to ensure a severance of ties. The DJ calculated the Wife’s monthly expenses to be $2,207, after revising down what was thought to be inflated figures. The DJ considered that a multiplicand of $500 per month was appropriate since the Wife’s take-home income was about $1,711. The DJ also used five years as a multiplier since the parties were married for that length. The DJ accordingly ordered the Husband to pay the Wife lump sum maintenance of $30,000. The DJ considered the income of the parties, the length of the marriage, and the expenses of the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Husband argues that no order of maintenance should have been made in favour of the Wife. The Wife is able to support herself with her own earnings in the context of a short childless marriage.

</div> If the court is minded to grant a maintenance order, the multiplicand should be $400 and the multiplier should be 28 months, which is half the length of the marriage. That would amount to a lump sum of $11,200.The Husband relies on the decision of Wei JC in <span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span> where he held that a reasonable multiplier for a marriage of about three years was 18 months.

</div> and that she could not be expected “to eat all her meals at hawker centres all her life”. The Wife asks for $10 for each meal instead of the $5 that the DJ allowed.

The Wife’s other contentions that her monthly expenses were higher than what the DJ took into account are unsubstantiated and, in my view, unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Husband’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">ADB v ADC</span> is similarly misplaced. Choo J merely suggested that maintenance should not be granted <span class="font-italic">as a matter of course</span>, in view of the present-day societal context. The case does not stand for the proposition that the starting point where a wife is working is that there would be no order as to maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I am of the view that the multiplicand of $500 per month is an appropriate one, taking into account the Wife’s income and expenses, as well as the Husband’s income. I differ with the DJ only on the appropriate multiplier. In view of the circumstances of this marriage, a more appropriate multiplier is two years. This is a short childless marriage. Both parties are working. It would be reasonable for a lump sum to be awarded to ease the Wife’s transition. I set this lump sum at $500 for two years, being $12,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Accordingly, the Husband is ordered to pay the Wife a lump sum maintenance of $12,000, calculated on a multiplicand of $500 per month multiplied by a period of two years.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jewellery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The DJ stated that both parties were prepared to return the jewellery given to each other by their respective families as wedding gifts. The main issue was whether the jewellery was in their possession. The DJ was of the view that there was no jurisdiction under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) to make an order to trace the whereabouts of the jewellery alleged to be in India. The DJ nonetheless recorded the agreement of both parties to return the jewellery given to them by the other’s family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On appeal, there was confusion as to whether each party was to return the jewellery given by the other party’s family to <span class="font-italic">that</span> party, or whether each party was to return the jewellery given by the other party’s family to the <span class="font-italic">other party</span>. The paragraph of the DJ’s judgment dealing with the issue seemed to reference both ideas, but the DJ’s final order was for the latter. The Wife said that the DJ’s order was correct as the Wife’s allegation was that the Husband still held jewellery given to her by her family, some of which was in India. The Husband’s counsel contended that the order ought to have been framed in terms of the return of jewellery given by the <span class="font-italic">other</span> side.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It seems to me that the DJ accepted she had no jurisdiction to make the order that she did, but in any event, recorded it as a consent order.
