These principles were summarised in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou </span><span class="font-italic">En</span> [2015] 3 SLR 222 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Hou En</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [24]) which I set out below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24  While the court will always be cognisant of the need for rehabilitation in cases where the accused person is suffering from a mental disorder, the principles with regards to sentencing an accused with a mental disorder can be distilled, for present purposes, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always a relevant factor in the sentencing process.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The manner and extent of its relevance depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental disorder.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The element of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight in some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) In spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence less effective, where for instance the offender has a significantly impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, then rehabilitation may take precedence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Even though rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not necessarily dictate a light sentence. The accused could also be rehabilitated in prison.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) Finally, in cases involving particularly heinous or serious offences, even when the accused person is labouring under a serious mental disorder, there is no reason why the retributive and protective principles of sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 What is clear from the above is that an offender’s mental disorder is undeniably a relevant factor in the sentencing process. However, the existence of a mental disorder does not necessarily mean that rehabilitation becomes the primary sentencing consideration. Rather, the nature and severity of the offender’s mental disorder, whether the accused person acted with premeditation and consciously chose to commit the offences, and whether the offences were particularly serious or heinous would have a significant bearing on the sentencing considerations which would prevail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee</span>, the CA recognised (at [65]–[66]) that there are generally two categories of mentally disordered offenders: (a) offenders with temporary and situational mental disorders who <span class="font-italic">retain their understanding of their actions and can reason and weigh the consequences</span>; and (b) offenders whose mental disorders severely impair their ability to understand the nature and consequences of their acts. In the case of an offender falling into the former category of mentally disordered offenders, the CA held that deterrence and retribution should still feature because the offender’s mind would still have been rational, and his mental disorder only ameliorates to a limited extent the criminal conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, while the Accused suffered from MDD at the time of the offences, the facts show that he falls within the former category of mentally disordered offenders identified in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng Yee </span>(at [65]–[66]) and listed above at [42] for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic"> </span>First, it is patently clear that the Accused retained a clear understanding of the nature and consequences of his actions. Based on the Statement of Facts (“SOF”), the Accused committed the offences because he was concerned about the Victims’ conditions and their caregiving arrangements once he and Anna passed on.

The Victims were not just young children, but also persons who suffered from ASD and GDD. The SOF also stated that the Victims were non-verbal when they were enrolled at a mainstream primary school when they were nine years old.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-929a4648-07df-49b1-b484-5339dd0822c9" data-toggle="modal" type="button">75</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I also agree with the Prosecution that the fact that Aston stood quietly as his brother was being strangled by his father demonstrates the particularly vulnerable nature of the Victims. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB</span> [2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) (at [34]), the CA highlighted the special need to protect vulnerable persons and noted that an offender’s culpability would generally be seen as enhanced where the victim is vulnerable, because the offender’s conduct would be viewed as “exploiting or taking advantage of a relatively helpless person”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and related to the point above, was the fact that the Accused had betrayed the deep trust which had been reposed in him as a parent of the Victims. Instead of caring for his children, the Accused proceeded to inflict severe and irreparable harm against the Victims by causing their deaths. In <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> (at [35]), the CA stated that violence against children by parents would be met with the full force of the law, citing the CA’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (at [33]) that “the level of confidence and trust that a child naturally reposes in his or her parent entails that a parent who betrays that trust and harms the child stands at the furthest end of the spectrum of guilt” [emphasis in original omitted].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the offences were premeditated. The SOF shows that the Accused first started harbouring serious thoughts of killing the Victims sometime at the start of 2022, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a few weeks before the offences on 21 January 2022.

In this regard, I do not entirely agree with the Prosecution that the Accused’s plea of guilt should be accorded limited weight simply because the public interest warrants a deterrent sentence in filicide cases.

</div> Here, while there is a clear public interest for a deterrent sentence, this must be balanced against the fact that the Accused has pleaded guilty at an early stage of the proceedings and has expressed remorse.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as I have recognised above at [41], I agree with the Defence that the Accused’s mental condition of MDD is, undeniably, a relevant mitigating factor in the sentencing process which must be carefully considered in determining the appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Defence states that the Accused has fully co-operated with the Police. I am unable to fully agree with the Defence on this point. The immediate post-offence conduct of the Accused which I have summarised above at [18] makes very clear that the Accused had lied to the Police that he was attacked.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the Defence states that the Accused has a mother aged 80 years old whom he wishes to take care of once he has served his sentence. I fail to see how this is a mitigating factor. It is well settled that, except in the most exceptional circumstances, hardship to the offender’s family has very little, if any, mitigating value: <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [11]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yue Mun Yew Gary</span> [2013] 1 SLR 39 at [67]–[68]. In the present case, the Accused has not demonstrated any form of hardship, much less an exceptional level of hardship, which would be caused to the Accused’s mother.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the Defence highlights that the Accused’s risk of reoffending is low and that he was gainfully employed before the offences and can still contribute to society after serving his sentence. However, in my view, this does not serve as a mitigating factor. If at all, this may be only relevant in considering, at the final stage, if the overall sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the Accused’s past record and future prospects: see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [57].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate individual sentence to be imposed for each of the s 304(</span>a<span class="font-italic">) Penal Code </span><span class="font-italic">charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Having considered the facts of the present case, the aggravating and mitigating factors, and the sentencing precedents cited by parties in their submissions, I am of the view that an individual sentence of seven years’ imprisonment for each of the two charges under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 An individual sentence of seven years’ imprisonment is consistent with the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution. Let me explain:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I first consider the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BAC</span> [2016] SGHC 49 (“<span class="font-italic">BAC</span>”). The offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for causing the death of her seven-year-old son who was diagnosed with autism by pushing him out of the kitchen window of their residential unit. The offender had been caught up in a cold war with her husband on the day of the offence and formed a thought that her son was the reason for her exhaustion and marital problems. She then formed an intention in the moment to cause the death of her son, coaxing him to stand on a top of a stool which was at the kitchen window before pushing him out. The offender had a background of MDD, with a relapse of her depression at the time of the offence. Though the offender was aware of the nature and quality of her actions, the psychiatrist opined that her depressive symptoms substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her actions or omissions around the time of the offence. The offender was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for her offence. In contrast to <span class="font-italic">BAC</span>, I agree that the present case is more aggravated given the significant degree of premeditation which featured in the Accused’s offences. As I have highlighted above at [47(c)], the Accused started harbouring thoughts of killing the Victims a few weeks before the offences were committed and he also chose to commit the offences at the Playground because it was quiet. Further, I think it is worth emphasising that the Accused’s conduct in the present case went one step further than the offender in <span class="font-italic">BAC </span>who had pushed her son out of the kitchen window. In the present case, beyond just strangling the Victims, the Accused then submerged their faces in the water in the canal to ensure that the Victims were actually dead. This circumstance makes the conduct of the Accused undeniably more aggravated. For these reasons, an uplift from the sentence of five years’ imprisonment in <span class="font-italic">BAC</span> is justified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I next consider the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v CAD</span> [2019] SGHC 262 (“<span class="font-italic">CAD</span>”). The offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for causing the death of her two-year-old daughter by throwing her on the floor and kicking her. The offender did so because she was frustrated at her daughter who had defecated on a towel and failed to listen to her instructions. The offender suffered from MDD at the time of the offence which was found to have substantially impaired her mental responsibility. The offender was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for her offence. In <span class="font-italic">CAD</span>, I had found (at [10]) that the mental disorder of the offender was not in any way related to the daughter of the offender and the offender had failed to attend a follow up with the IMH prior to the commission of her offence. On this basis, I had accorded less mitigating weight to her condition. I accept that the present case is different, given that the Accused’s MDD was related to the Victims, and he had not been diagnosed with MDD before the offences. However, this has to be squared against the fact that the Accused acted with premeditation. Coupled with this is the fact that I have highlighted earlier about the aggravated nature of the Accused’s conduct where he submerged the Victims’ faces in the water to ensure they were actually dead after already strangling them. Balancing these factors, I find that an individual sentence of seven years’ imprisonment is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the other hand, I am unable to agree with the Defence that an individual sentence not exceeding five years’ imprisonment is justified based on the sentencing precedents which the Defence seeks to rely on. These are my reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Defence relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Han John Han </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1180 (“<span class="font-italic">Han</span>”). The offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) for causing the death of his pregnant wife by plunging an old sword into her chest. The offender was found to have suffered from a delusional disorder of the persecutory type at the time of the offence. The offender was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for the offence. In my view, the case of <span class="font-italic">Han </span>does not assist the Defence here. Here, I emphasise that a careful review of the offender’s mental disorder in <span class="font-italic">Han </span>would show that the offender’s delusional disorder there led him to view his wife as a perpetrator who had been using black magic on him. This continued to operate on his mind in the days preceding the offence. Seen in this light, his mental responsibility was significantly lower than the Accused in the present case. As I had highlighted above at [42], the CA had helpfully set out two categories of mentally disordered offenders in <span class="font-italic">Kong Peng </span><span class="font-italic">Yee</span> (at [65] – [66]). In my view, the offender in <span class="font-italic">Han</span> would have fallen into the category of offenders whose mental disorders severely impaired their ability to understand the nature and consequences of their acts, and where the underlying reason for their criminal conduct is founded on fantasy or fiction as opposed to fact. The Accused in the present case does not fall into this category. Rather, as I have explained above at [43], the Accused falls into the category of mentally disordered offenders who retain a clear understanding of the nature and consequences of their actions, and where the underlying reason for their criminal conduct is founded fact as opposed to fantasy or fiction. The Accused’s sentence must accurately reflect this degree of his mental responsibility. As such, I would caution against a simplistic comparison of the offender in <span class="font-italic">Han </span>with the Accused in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Next, the Defence seeks permission to rely on the unreported case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tham Ngan Hoe</span> (Criminal Case No 37 of 1984). Based on the facts which were admitted to by the offender in that case, the offender pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304 of the Penal Code (Cap 103) for causing the death of her 19-month-old daughter. The offender had been earlier humiliated by her husband who had been having an extramarital affair. The offender had consumed a number of pills on the day of the offence in a bid to commit suicide. Whilst under the influence of the pills, the offender realised that there would be no caregiver for her daughter once she died. The offender therefore suffocated her daughter to death. The offender was sentenced to six and a half months’ imprisonment for her offence. While the Defence seeks to rely on this decision in an attempt to convince this Court to exercise judicial mercy and to accord a lower sentence to the Accused, I am unable to agree with the Defence for two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) First, it is trite that unreported decisions lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire factual landscape required to appreciate the precise sentences imposed: <span class="font-italic">Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Hanib v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2022] SGHC 101 at [173]. The reason for placing little, if any, weight on an unreported precedent is that it is unreasoned, and it is therefore not possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge: <span class="font-italic">Janardana </span><span class="font-italic">Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1288 at [13(b)].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, there is simply no basis given the facts of the present case to consider an exercise of judicial mercy. As was set out in <span class="font-italic">M Raveendran v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 3 SLR 1183 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveendran</span>”) (at [62]–[64]), it was made clear that judicial mercy exists as an exceptional jurisdiction, and the threshold to warrant the exercise of judicial mercy is an exceedingly high one. Further, as was noted in <span class="font-italic">Raveendran </span>(at [60]), the typical situations in which judicial mercy has been invoked has been founded in concerns relating to ill health. While the situations in which judicial mercy may be exercised are not closed, there are no exceptional circumstances in the present case which warrant the exercise of judicial mercy in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I pause here to note that while the Prosecution seeks an individual sentence in a range which extends to ten years’ imprisonment, I do not find that a sentence above seven years’ imprisonment is appropriate in this case. This is because adequate weight must be placed on the Accused’s plea of guilt as well as the fact that the Accused was suffering from MDD at the time of the offences which was of such severity and persistence that it impaired his judgment. While I recognise that his MDD did not affect his ability to understand that killing was wrong or understand the consequences of causing the death of the Victims, Dr Cheok’s report makes clear that the Accused’s MDD impaired his judgment such that he felt that it was acceptable to kill the Victims to relieve them of their stress and suffering.

Given that parties appear to disagree on whether the two offences were committed in the course of a single transaction, I find it useful to reproduce in full the court’s observations on the one-transaction rule in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> (at [27]–[32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27  Having decided on the appropriate sentence for each offence, it then falls on the sentencing judge to consider which of the sentences should run consecutively. The first rule that the sentencing judge should consider is what has been referred to as the one-transaction rule. This is not an inflexible or rigid rule but it serves as a filter to sieve out those sentences that ought not as a general rule to be ordered to be run consecutively. The clearest statement of the principle may be found in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">PP v Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span>”), where V K Rajah J (as he then was) said as follows at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The one-transaction rule requires that where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive: <span class="font-italic">Maideen</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai v PP</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 706; <span class="font-italic">Kanagasuntharam</span><span class="font-italic"> v PP</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 874 (‘<span class="font-italic">Kanagasuntharam</span><span class="font-italic">’</span>).

Such an interpretation was also adopted by Dr D A Thomas in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing</span> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) (‘<span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing</span>’), who opined at p 54:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The concept of “single transaction” may be held to cover a sequence of offences involving a repetition of <span class="font-italic">the same behaviour</span> towards the <span class="font-italic">same victim</span> … provided the offences are committed <span class="font-italic">within a relatively short space of time.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[High Court’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span>]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28  In <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> at [52] the touchstones identified were whether there was proximity of time and proximity in the type of offence. The Malaysian Court of Appeal has developed this into four elements: proximity of time, proximity of place, continuity of action and continuity of purpose or design: see <span class="font-italic">Bachik bin Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor</span> [2004] 2 MLJ 534 at [7].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29  Although Rajah J in <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng</span> interpreted the rationale for the rule in terms of proximity, in my judgment, this is better understood as a preliminary enquiry to help ascertain whether or not the distinct offences are to be seen as part of a single transaction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30  The better articulation of the rationale for the rule is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest” (see D A Thomas, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing</span> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at p 53): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The essence of the one-transaction rule appears to be that <span class="font-italic">consecutive sentences are inappropriate when all the offences taken together constitute a single invasion of the same legally protected interest</span>. The principle applies where two or more offences arise from the same facts — as when the same series of blows constitutes assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wilful ill treatment of a child, or malicious wounding and indecent assault — <span class="font-italic">but the fact that the two offences are committed simultaneously or close together in time does not necessarily mean that they amount to a single transaction</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31  On this formulation, the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences. Where multiple offences are found to be proximate as a matter of fact but violate different legally protected interests, then they would not, at least as a general rule, be regarded as forming a single transaction. However, it should be said for the avoidance of doubt that even if this offers a better rationale for the one-transaction rule, that does not make it a test which is to be rigidly applied. As will be evident from the analysis that is set out below, even where a sentencing judge is able to identify that a set of offences violates different legally protected interests, it does not always or necessarily follow that those offences cannot be regarded as part of the same transaction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32  But the main point I make here is that a straightforward application of the tests for proximity of time and proximity of type of offence cannot be determinative of the question whether a series of offences are to taken <span class="font-italic">by the law</span> to be part of the same transaction so as not to warrant separate punishment. The one-transaction rule is an <span class="font-italic">evaluative</span> rule that is directed towards the ultimate enquiry that a sentencing court is engaged in: whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time. This will often, if not inevitably, bring into play moral considerations and it would be impossible to resolve these <span class="font-italic">solely</span> by reference to facts (such as proximity in time) which, in and of themselves, might be devoid of moral significance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The two offences in the present case involved two <span class="font-italic">different</span> victims</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Applying the principles above to the present case, it is apparent that the two offences committed by the Accused do not constitute a single transaction because the two offences related to two<span class="font-italic"> different </span>victims. As was set out in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> (at [27]) which cited <span class="font-italic">Law </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Meng </span>(at [52]), the one-transaction rule is concerned with whether the offences form a sequence that are proximate in time and type of offence <span class="font-italic">against the same victim</span>. In the present case, the offences were against two distinct victims. In light of this reality, my view is that the one-transaction rule simply does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The presence of proximity of time, space and type of offence does not necessarily mean that the one-transaction rule is engaged</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Further, while both parties accept that there was proximity of time, space and the type of offence in the present case, these still do not in and of themselves mean that the one-transaction rule is engaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As was set out in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> (at [30]), which cited an excerpt by D A Thomas in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Sentencing</span> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979), the fact that the two offences are committed simultaneously or close together in time <span class="font-italic">does not necessarily mean</span> that they amount to a single transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Loh Cheok San </span>[2023] SGHC 190, the High Court stated (at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Raveen </span>at [39]) that whether the various offences form part of a single transaction depends on whether they constitute a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”. This was precisely what was stated in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee </span>(at [29]) as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, it is clear that the two offences took place in the same period of time and at the same space, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at the Playground on the afternoon of 21 January 2022. It is also clear that the legally protected interest which was violated in both acts was of the same type – the sanctity of life. However, it is important to emphasise here that the offences led to the infringement of two <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> legally protected interests – the legally protected interest of Ethan and the legally protected interest of Aston.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Seen in this light, the one-transaction rule is not engaged in the present case because <span class="font-italic">two </span>legally protected interests were violated – Ethan’s legally protected interest <span class="font-italic">and</span> Aston’s legally protected interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The manner in which the Accused caused the death of the Victims is relevant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The analysis above is further bolstered by the fact that the manner in which the Accused the death of Ethan and Aston was also distinct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 While the offences relate to the Accused causing the death of the Victims by strangling them, it would be an oversimplification if one glosses over the facts which show the distinct manner in which the offences were committed. The SOF makes very clear that the manner in which the Accused caused the deaths of the Victims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the actus reus of the two offences) was not entirely the same. I explain below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the case of Ethan, the Accused first used a stick which he had picked up and pressed it hard against Ethan’s neck. It was only after this broke that he strangled Ethan by placing his forearm around Ethan’s neck and pressing down. He then submerged Ethan in the water. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the case of Aston, the Accused first tried to strangle Aston by placing his forearm across Aston’s neck but they both fell to the ground. He then went on top of Aston and placed his forearm on Aston’s neck to choke him until he became motionless. The Accused then placed Aston on the ground with his face submerged in the water. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Given the above, to simply state that the two offences were part of a single transaction involving the strangulation of the Victims ignores the nuances that emerge from a careful reading of the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) There was no continuity of purpose or design between the two offences unlike what the Defence suggests</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I next consider the Defence’s suggestion that there was a continuity of purpose and design between the two offences committed by the Accused. Here, the Defence states that “this act of the Accused is part of the same one single transaction of wanting to kill both Ethan and Aston together” and that the Accused “had wanted to put an end to the mortal suffering of both Ethan and Aston”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I pause here to note that the Defence appears to conflate the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of the offences with the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> in their submission. However, taking the Defence’s case at its highest, the Defence appears to be suggesting that the Accused had a singular purpose – to cause the death of both children – and that there was a continuity of purpose when he proceeded to strangle both of them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In my view, this argument does not take the Defence’s case very far. While the Defence may attempt to frame this as a continuity of purpose, this ignores the fact that the Accused had two <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> purposes when he set out to carry out the offences on that day – to cause the death of Ethan <span class="font-italic">and</span> to cause the death of Aston. He was acting upon each <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>purpose when he carried out the offence against Ethan followed by the offence against Aston. I do not accept the Defence’s submission that the two <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>purposes can be viewed together as a single purpose to cause the death of the Victims so as to advance an argument that there was a continuity of purpose. This would be an impermissible simplification of the facts and the Accused’s intentions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Even if the one-transaction rule was engaged, the rule is an <span class="font-italic">evaluative </span>rule</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Based on the above, it is clear that the two offences in the present case do not constitute a single transaction. Therefore, the one-transaction rule is not engaged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 However, even if the one-transaction rule were engaged, it is important to recognise that the court in <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> made clear (at [32]) that the one-transaction rule is an <span class="font-italic">evaluative</span> rule which is directed towards the ultimate enquiry that a sentencing court is engaged in: whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time. This will often, if not inevitably, bring into play moral considerations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the present case, the Accused caused the death of <span class="font-italic">two</span> persons and deprived <span class="font-italic">two</span> individuals of their <span class="font-italic">right to live</span>. He committed the offences while holding a grossly misguided view that he would be helping the Victims and freeing them of mortal suffering by causing their deaths. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, it would be an absurd outcome and morally unjust if the law allows him to avoid being punished adequately for his offences which led to the death of his two children by allowing the sentences to be run concurrently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">An application of the totality principle leads to the conclusion that the overall sentence is appropriate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Finally, I consider the totality principle. The totality principle requires the court to examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the sentences normally meted out for the most serious of the individual offences committed: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [54]. The court would then proceed to consider whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects: <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [57].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 By ordering the individual sentences to run consecutively in the present case, the aggregate sentence would be 14 years’ imprisonment. In my view, this sentence cannot be said to be substantially above the sentences normally meted out for the most serious of the individual offences committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my view, this court is required to order the two individual sentences to run consecutively so as to accurately reflect the overall criminality of the Accused’s conduct which led to the loss of two innocent lives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Further, the Accused is presently 50 years old. Taking into account any possible remission from which he may benefit, the aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment cannot be said to be crushing or not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the reasons above, I sentence the Accused to seven years’ imprisonment for each of the two charges under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. The two sentences are ordered to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment. The Accused has been in remand since his arrest on 22 January 2022. Therefore, I order that the aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment be backdated to commence from 22 January 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my view, the overall sentence which I have imposed seeks to balance the fact that a heinous and serious set of offences occurred on 21 January 2022 and the fact that the Accused suffered from MDD at the time of the offences. The sentences cannot in any way compensate for the tragic loss of two innocent young lives. One hopes, however, that the Accused will use this time to reflect on the irreversible harm he has caused to his family as a result of his misconceived belief that he would be easing the suffering and pain of the Victims and of those around him by committing the offences.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Kumaresan Gohulabalan, Lim Shin Hui and Goh Qi Shuen (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Choo Si Sen, Nai Thiam Siew Patrick, Choo Yean Lin (Tan Lee &amp; Partners) and Muhammad Razeen bin Sayed Majunoon (Advance Law LLC)<span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> for the </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Defence.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
