        Chan Seng Onn J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The purpose of the offer to settle mechanism
                    prescribed under Order 22A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006
                    Rev Ed), which is derived from rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, Ontario
                    RRO 1990, Reg 194, is to “encourage termination of litigation by the
                    agreement of the parties — more speedily and less expensively than by
                    judgment of the court at the end of the trial”: <em>per</em> Morden ACJO in <em>Data General (Canada) Ltd
                        v Molnar Systems Group</em> (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 392 at 398.
                    Ironically, it was the construction of an offer to settle under Order 22A
                    that lay at the heart of the dispute in the present matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This matter raises the interesting question of
                    whether and, if so, to what extent, do ordinary contractual principles of offer
                    and acceptance apply to the statutory regime of offers to settle under Order
                    22A. The theoretical answer to the question must be that ordinary contractual
                    principles apply to the extent that they are not inconsistent with what the
                    Rules of Court expressly provide. However, as will be seen in the present case,
                    the application of theory to practice is not as straightforward as it
                    seems.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 15 April 2009, Chua Chye Hee (“the
                    Plaintiff”) was involved in a motor accident with Saw Shu Mawa Min Min
                    (“the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant”). As a result of
                    the accident, the Plaintiff was rendered tetraplegic. At the material time of
                    the accident, the First Defendant was an employee of GEA Westfelia Separator
                    (SEA) Pte Ltd (“the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 15 September 2010, the Plaintiff commenced
                    Suit No 704 of 2010 against both the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, with liability and damages to be
                    determined in two separate tranches. On 10 February 2011, interlocutory
                    judgment on the issue of liability was entered by consent against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants
                    for 100%, with the Plaintiff’s damages to be assessed and with interest
                    and costs reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After determining the issue of liability, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s insurer, Allianz Global
                    Corporate and Specialty AG, Singapore Branch stepped in to defend the suit on
                    behalf of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendants. For convenience, I shall refer to the insurer as “the
                    Defendant”, since it was the party who made the relevant offer to settle
                    to the Plaintiff in this suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s first offer to settle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 9 March 2011, the Defendant made an offer to
                    settle under Order 22A to the Plaintiff at $352,316.08, representing the
                    estimated loss of the Plaintiff’s earnings calculated based on a
                    3 year multiplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s first offer to settle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 21 March 2011, the Plaintiff made an offer to
                    settle under Order 22A to the Defendant at the sum of $594,954.60, representing
                    the estimated loss of his earnings calculated based on a higher multiplier of
                    5.75 years. The Plaintiff also gave the Defendant full access to his medical
                    records. On 3 May 2011, the Defendant’s medical expert conducted an
                    independent examination of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s second offer to settle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 17 June 2011, based on the medical
                    examination and their first offer to settle, the Defendant made a second offer
                    to settle under Order 22A to the Plaintiff at $435,000.00. The Defendant wrote a
                    letter to the Plaintiff in Form 33, stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">
<b>OFFER TO SETTLE</b>
</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendants offer to settle the proceedings under Order 22A by paying
                        the Plaintiff the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The sum of <b>S$435,000.00</b> as damages and
                        interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Costs of the action and
                            reasonable disbursements to be agreed or otherwise taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Dated this 17<sup>th</sup> day of June 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="right">[Signed]</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The figure of $435,000.00 is an intermediate
                    figure between the Defendant’s first offer to settle at $352,316.08; and
                    the Plaintiff’s first offer to settle at $594,954.60. Attached to this
                    second offer to settle is another letter which set out the following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The dispute in the present case is whether or
                    not this second offer to settle from the Defendant dated 17 June 2011
                    (“the Defendant’s second offer to settle”) had been validly
                    accepted by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s second offer to settle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 23 August 2011, the Plaintiff made a second
                    offer to settle to the Defendant at $600,000, inclusive of all interim payments.
                    However, the Defendant did not accept this offer to settle and nothing in this
                    case turns on this second offer to settle made by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In summary, the Plaintiff and the Defendant
                    each made two offers to settle pursuant to Order 22A. However, as will be
                    seen, this case turns solely upon whether the Defendant’s second offer to
                    settle was validly accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s 1<sup>st</sup> and
                    2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 27 August 2011, which was a Saturday, the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel accepted the Defendant’s second offer to settle
                    via two modes:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     by sending a facsimile in Form 35 at
                        6.26 pm to the Defendant’s counsel, (“the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Acceptance”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     by personally
                        posting an acceptance in Form 35 to the address of the Defendant’s
                        counsel at about 6.45 pm (“the 2<sup>nd</sup>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Acceptance was received by facsimile on Monday, 29 August 2011;

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties seemed to dispute the exact timing
                    when the Defendant’s counsel received the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Acceptance. I note that the Plaintiff produced a copy of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance with a stamp at the bottom right
                    hand corner which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This document served on us at <b>2.09 pm</b> on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As the authenticity of this document or the
                    stamp therein was not disputed, I therefore found that the earliest time that
                    Defendant’s counsel had been physically served the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was 2.09 pm on 31 August
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Death of the Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At 11.06 am on 29 August 2011, the Plaintiff
                    passed away. Although the Plaintiff’s counsel had posted the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance two days <b><em>prior</em></b> to the Plaintiff’s death, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was however received by the
                    Defendant’s counsel two days <b><em>after</em></b> the
                    Plaintiff’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After the Plaintiff passed away, both the
                    Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s counsel wrote to each other
                    disputing whether or not the Plaintiff had validly accepted the
                    Defendant’s second offer to settle <em>via</em>
                    either the 1<sup>st</sup> Acceptance or the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance. In the meantime, the
                    Defendant’s counsel did not withdraw the Defendant’s second offer to
                    settle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 8 December 2011, on the instructions of
                    Chia Kim Huay, the litigation representative of the estate of the Plaintiff
                    (hereinafter also referred to as the “Plaintiff” where the context
                    applies), the Plaintiff’s counsel served another acceptance in
                    Form 35 (“the 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance”) on
                    the Defendant’s counsel accepting the Defendant’s second offer to
                    settle, which the Defendant’s counsel took no steps to withdraw despite
                    knowing full well that the Plaintiff had already passed away more than three
                    months ago. The service and receipt of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Acceptance was not disputed. The Defendant’s second offer to settle was
                    finally withdrawn by Defendant’s counsel on 13 January 2012 using Form
                    34.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s Summons No 5809 of 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 23 December 2011, the Plaintiff filed
                    Summons No 5809 of 2011 praying for judgment to be entered for the Plaintiff on
                    the terms of the Defendant’s second offer to settle, which the Plaintiff
                    contended had been validly accepted. In response, the Defendant filed Summons No
                    135 of 2012 on 10 January 2012 seeking the following declaratory relief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that the
                        Defendant’s second offer to settle was not validly accepted by the
                        Plaintiff before he passed away on 29 August 2011; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     a declaration that the
                        Defendant’s second offer to settle had determined on the death of the
                        Plaintiff on 29 August 2011 and was thereafter no longer capable of being
                        accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I heard the both counsel on 26 March 2012 and
                    granted the prayers of the Plaintiff in Summons No 5809 of 2011 and dismissed
                    Summons No 135 of 2012. I ordered the Defendant to pay:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     general damages of
                        $360,139.61;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     special damages of $71,117.71;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     pre-judgment interest of $3,742.67;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     costs and
                        reasonable disbursements of both Summonses to be fixed at $2,500 with the
                        usual consequential orders to follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After making the above order, the
                    Defendant’s counsel wrote in to request for further arguments to be made.
                    After considering the further arguments, I confirm my decision and I shall now
                    give the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The only legal issue in the present case
                    before me is simply which, if any, of the three acceptances made by the
                    Plaintiff are valid? As long as the Plaintiff can successfully show that at
                    least one acceptance has been validly served and received while the
                    Defendant’s second offer to settle is still valid, the Defendant’s
                    second offer to settle must have been validly accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before going into the specifics of the Order
                    22A mechanism, it is important to appreciate the rationale behind the relevant
                    rules. The Court of Appeal cautioned in <em>The “Endurance
                        1”</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 970 at [39] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    It appears to us from that part of the learned
                            judge’s grounds of judgment we have set out in [37] above that the
                            learned judge applied the rule literally without the exercise of any
                            discretion or making an inquiry into the rationale and policy of the
                            rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court of Appeal went on to explain the
                    rationale of Order 22A in <em>The “Endurance
                        1”</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 970 at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In the Ontario Court
                            of Appeal in <em>Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molnar
                                Systems Group Inc</em> (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 392,
                            Morden ACJO identified the rationale behind r 49 of their Rules of
                            Civil Procedure. He said at 398-399:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">As far as the dictionary meaning of ‘settle’ is concerned,
                            while it may commonly be the case that when a party
                            ‘settles’ a proceeding the settlement will involve some
                            element of compromise, on one side or both. I do not think that
                            ‘settle’ necessarily requires a compromise. <em>The word means to bring a dispute to an end by arrangement
                                of the parties as opposed to by judgment of a court on the
                                merits</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The purpose of r 49 is to encourage the termination of litigation by
                            agreement of the parties – more speedily and less expensively than
                            by judgment of the court at the end of the trial. <em>The
                                impetus to settle is a mechanism which enables a plaintiff to make a
                                serious offer respecting his or her estimate of the value of the
                                claim which will require the defendant to give early (that is, when
                                the offer is served) and careful consideration of the merits of the
                                case</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in the original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In my opinion, the above rationale must be
                    kept in mind in considering to what extent ordinary principles of contract law
                        (<em>ie</em> rules of offer and acceptance, the postal
                    acceptance rule etc.) are applicable to the offer to settle regime under
                    Order 22A of the Rules of Court. This will in turn help resolve the legal
                    issues in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview of Order 22A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The very title “offer to settle”
                    and the language of Order 22A suggest that Order 22A cannot be understood
                    in a vacuum without reference to ordinary principles of contract law such as
                    concepts of offer and acceptance. However, being a statutory mechanism,
                    Order 22A modifies the ordinary rules of contract law and imposes certain
                    statutory restrictions, including formality requirements, on the parties should
                    they choose to invoke Order 22A. I shall first examine the areas in which
                    the offer to settle mechanism under Order 22A departs from the ordinary
                    rules of contract at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Parties to a lawsuit often make offers to each
                    other in order to try to settle the lawsuit out of court. Such an offer,
                    however, is not an “offer to settle” within the meaning of
                    Order 22A. Order 22A is a statutory mechanism which requires parties

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I accept the submissions of the
                    Defendant’s counsel that the 1<sup>st</sup> Acceptance by
                    facsimile on 27 August 2011 was clearly not in compliance with
                    Order 62 rule 6(1)(c). There is no evidence to show that the party
                    serving and the party to be served had agreed on other modes of service pursuant
                    to Order 62 rule 6(1)(d). Therefore, I find that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Acceptance was not valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance
                    was posted on 27 August 2011. The Plaintiff passed away on 29 August 2011, and
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was received only on 31 August
                    2011. Whether or not the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was valid
                    depends on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the postal acceptance rule
                        applies to Order 22A; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Plaintiff’s death caused the offer to
                        determine on 29 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was valid because the postal
                    acceptance rule operated to deem the acceptance to have been served on the
                    Defendant on 27 August 2011, before the Plaintiff passed away. Further or in the
                    alternative, the Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the Defendant’s
                    second offer to settle did not determine upon the Plaintiff’s death and
                    was subsequently validly accepted on 31 August 2011. He argued that there was no
                    scope within Order 22A for implying terms that were not stated in the
                    Defendant’s second offer to settle itself. The Defendant could have framed
                    the terms of the offer to settle in any way it wished, but it chose not to
                    specify the condition that the offer is deemed withdrawn upon the
                    Plaintiff’s death. The Defendant was fully informed of the medical
                    condition of the Plaintiff. By choosing the statutory mechanism under Order 22A
                    which required a notice period of one day before the offer can be withdrawn, the
                    Defendant knowingly ran the risk of the Plaintiff passing away before it could
                    withdraw the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defendant’s counsel submitted that
                    the postal acceptance rule does not apply to service of court documents. He also
                    submitted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was not valid
                    because the Defendant’s second offer to settle had determined immediately
                    upon the Plaintiff’s death and could not be accepted after the Plaintiff
                    died on 29 August 2011.</p>

                        should be noted at the outset: <b><em>the “postal
                            acceptance rule” is effective even if the letter of acceptance is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I am not persuaded that the postal acceptance
                    rule applies to accepting an offer to settle under Order 22A.
                    Order 22A rule 6(1) requires an offer to be accepted by
                    “serving” an acceptance of offer in Form 35 on the party who
                    made the offer (see [36] above). This formality requirement goes beyond the
                    common law requirement of communicating the acceptance to the offeror. The
                    offeror must be <em>served</em> the acceptance in
                    Form 35, and “service” of documents is dealt with
                    specifically under Order 62 of the Rules of Court. The Rules of Court
                    clearly override the common law rules of acceptance of offers in the event of
                    any inconsistency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Order 62 rule 6(1)(b) allows service of any
                    document to be effected by post. Section 2(5) of the Interpretation Act
                    (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) sets out the requirements that must be met before
                    the service by post can be deemed to be effected:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Where an Act authorises or requires any document
                            to be served by post, whether the word “serve”,
                            “give” or “send” or any other word is used,
                            then, unless a contrary intention appears, <em>the
                                service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing,
                                prepaying and posting a letter containing the document</em>,
                            and, unless the contrary is proved, <em>shall be deemed
                                to have been effected at the time at which the letter would be
                                delivered in the ordinary course of post.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the context of service of documents,
                    section 2(5) of the Interpretation Act modifies the postal acceptance rule at
                    common law. While the postal acceptance rule deems an acceptance sent by post to
                    be effective at the point of posting the letter of acceptance, section 2(5)
                    of the Interpretation Act deems service to be effected only:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     by properly addressing, prepaying
                        and posting a letter containing the document; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     at the time at which the letter would
                        be delivered in the ordinary course of post.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I therefore hold that the postal acceptance
                    rule has no application in the context of service of documents by post, as the
                    common law rule has been statutorily modified by section 2(5) of the
                    Interpretation Act. I accordingly reject the Plaintiff’s counsel
                    submission that the postal acceptance rule applies and the acceptance should be
                    deemed validly made when it was posted by the Plaintiff on 27 August 2011.
                    In the absence of submissions to the effect that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance should be deemed to have been
                    served at a date earlier than the date of actual receipt (<em>ie</em> 31 August 2011) under section 2(5) of the
                    Interpretation Act, I find that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance
                    took effect only when it was actually delivered to and received by the Defendant
                    on 31 August 2011 and not any earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The effect of death</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     This case therefore turned on whether or not
                    the Defendant’s second offer to settle determined on the Plaintiff’s
                    death. If it did not, then it would not matter that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance took effect only on 31 August
                    2011. The submissions of the Defendant’s counsel appeared to rest on the
                    assumption that the Defendant’s second offer to settle automatically
                    determined upon the Plaintiff’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Plaintiff’s counsel, on the other
                    hand, submitted that the Defendant’s second offer to settle remained valid
                    until it was withdrawn, which was very much later on 13 January 2012.
                    Therefore, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance received by the
                    Defendant on 31 August 2011 was valid, notwithstanding the
                    Plaintiff’s death on 29 August 2011 and the inapplicability of the
                    postal acceptance rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The outcome of this issue would depend on
                    whether or not the Defendant’s second offer to settle determined upon the
                    death of the Plaintiff. The starting point of the analysis is, once again, to
                    look at the rules at common law relating to the effect of death on offers; and
                    see whether the common law rules have been modified by statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The common law rules relating to death of an
                    offeree are unfortunately not very well settled. At common law, the death of
                    either the offeror or the offeree may have an effect on the validity of the
                    offer, depending on the nature of the offer. The authors of <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> explained at p 121:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  Death</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would appear that death of either the offeror or offeree is another
                        obvious category under which the offer terminates. <em>However, the relevant rules may not be altogether clear, although it
                            does appear that knowledge is a key element.</em> Where the
                        offeror passes away, and if the offeree knows of the offeror’s death,
                        he will not be allowed to effect a valid acceptance. On the contrary, if the
                        offeree is ignorant of the offeror’s death, the legal position would
                        appear to be unclear, with the relevant authorities going both ways. The
                        better view in the last-mentioned situation would appear to be that a valid
                        acceptance is possible, save in those situations where some element of
                        personal service or the like is required on the offeror’s part.
                            <em>If the offeree passes away, it would appear that his
                            personal representatives cannot accept the offer on behalf of the
                            deceased offeree’s estate.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Whether or not the personal representatives of
                    the estate of the deceased may accept an offer made prior to deceased’s
                    death depends on whether the offer to the deceased was a personal one or not.
                    Michael Furmston and G J Tolhurst in <em>Contract Formation:
                        Law and Practice</em> (Oxford University Press, 2010) stated at
                    p 32:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the death of the offeree prior to acceptance, on one view,
                        offers are inherently personal and so they cannot be accepted by the estate
                        of the offeree if the offeree dies prior to acceptance. Similarly it has
                        been said that an offer made to a living person ceases to be an offer if
                        that person dies prior to accepting the offer. <em>However,
                            it would appear that the preferred view is that the nature of an offer
                            depends on construction, it may be personal and it may not.</em>
                        The fact that it is possible to make an offer to more than one person proves
                        this point. <em>It would then follow that a non-personal
                            offer could be accepted by the personal representatives of the
                            offeree.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added; footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I agree with the above view. Whether or not an
                    offer is considered “personal” to the offeree is matter of
                    construction, depending on the facts of each case. The exercise is not a
                    technical one and must be approached with a certain degree of common
                    sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On the facts of this case, I do not construe

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Section 10(1) of the Civil Law Act states that
                    all causes of action vested in the deceased shall survive for the benefit of his
                    estate. Causes of action that survive the death of a plaintiff cannot be
                    considered personal in nature since the action could be continued by the
                    personal representatives of the deceased. If the cause of action cannot be
                    considered personal, I am not persuaded that an offer to settle purporting to
                    settle the surviving cause of action can be considered personal. Since there is
                    nothing in Order 22A to suggest that the statutory regime is intended to be
                    different from the common law in this regard, I accordingly find that the
                    Defendant’s second offer to settle was not personal and did not determine
                    upon the death of the Plaintiff on 29 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Defendant’s counsel argued that this
                    outcome was not in line with the spirit of Order 22A. However, as pointed out by
                    the Plaintiff’s counsel (whose arguments on this point I accepted), the
                    Defendant was free to frame its offer to settle on any terms and conditions as
                    it wished. The authors of <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> explain at p 118:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  Lapse of time: Where offer contains express or
                            implied term as to lapsing of offer</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An offer can also be terminated by lapse of time. There are at least two
                        basic situations. The first … relates to a situation where <em>the offer itself contains an express term as to when the offer
                            will lapse</em>, as happened in the High Court decision of
                            <em>Dickson Trading (S) Pte Ltd v Transmarco
                            Ltd</em> [1987] SLR(R) 674. … It should also be
                        noted, however, that although <em>the offeror is perfectly
                            entitled to set a cut-off date for its offer</em>, the offer
                        concerned will still be open for acceptance if the offeror conducts itself
                        in such a manner as to make it clear to the offeree that it is in fact
                        extending the deadline. This was indeed found to be the case in the High
                        Court decision of <em>Panwell Pte Ltd v Indian
                            Bank</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 462.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having not qualified its offer in express
                    terms, the Defendant is now indirectly asking the court to imply a condition
                    that the Defendant’s second offer to settle determined upon the death of
                    the Plaintiff. Keeping in mind that the rationale of Order 22A is to
                    encourage settlement rather than prolong it, the court should be extremely slow
                    to imply terms into offers to settle which are otherwise clearly worded and
                    unambiguous, as was in this case. This case serves as a reminder that the more
                    expressly the terms and conditions are stated in an offer to settle, the lesser
                    the need to rely on the doctrine of implied terms. However, as neither counsel
                    had addressed me on the issue of implied terms, I make no findings on this
                    issue; and by implication, the Defendant’s second offer to settle stands
                    solely on its express terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I shall deal with one final argument on this
                    issue. The Defendant’s counsel cited the table (see above at [9]) sent
                    together with the Defendant’s second offer to settle setting out the
                    breakdown of each component used in arriving at the settlement figure of
                    $435,000.00. It was argued that the table should be taken into account because
                    it evinced components that would not have applied if the Plaintiff had passed
                    away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Order 22A rule 1 requires all offers to settle
                    to be in Form 33. This formality requirement was not satisfied because the table
                    was sent separately from Form 33, and the Form 33 served on the
                    Plaintiff did not make any reference to the table. Therefore, the table is
                    irrelevant as it did not form part of the Defendant’s second offer to
                    settle. In any event, even if the table formed part of the Defendant’s
                    second offer to settle, the Plaintiff only had to agree with the final monetary
                    figure and not with each component given in the breakdown. Even if the Plaintiff
                    had disagreed with every component in the table, he could still have validly
                    accepted the Defendant’s second offer to settle as long as he agreed with
                    the final sum proposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the light of the reasons given above, I
                    find that the Defendant’s second offer to settle was validly accepted by
                    the Plaintiff when the 2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was served on
                    the Defendant on 31 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the light of my findings above, the issue
                    of the validity of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance becomes
                    irrelevant. The Defendant’s counsel submitted at length that, whatever the
                    position the law was on the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptances, the Plaintiff (i) had
                    waived his right; (ii) was estopped; or (iii) was otherwise precluded
                    from making the 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance. However, the validity
                    of all the acceptances made after the Plaintiff’s death on 29 August
                    2011 (<em>ie</em> the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptances) would turn on whether the
                    Defendant’s second offer to settle determined upon the Plaintiff’s
                    death. Since I have already found that the offer did not determine upon the
                    Plaintiff’s death (see above at [48] to [58]), and that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was valid, I do not need to deal
                    with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance separately. Even if the
                    Defendant’s counsel had prevailed on the issues he had raised with respect
                    to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Acceptance, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Acceptance was still an insurmountable hurdle
                    for him.</p>
