The Accused had disposed of the piece of string after the Deceased’s death before the police arrived as she was worried that her act of tying up the Deceased would be discovered.

In Dr Paul’s opinion, if the Deceased was subjected to further starvation, it would have resulted in severe and debilitating starvation changes which would lead to progressive multi-organ failure and, if left untreated, death. There was no evidence that the Deceased had any chronic or debilitating illness, pre-existing infection or disease which would result in her poor nutritional state of emaciation.

Such a fracture would not be fatal by itself but would indicate a very violent compression or blow to the upper front and side of the neck. The extensive force could have led to irreversible damage changes in the Deceased’s brain, and her poor nutritional state compounded her inability to tolerate the repeated trauma to her neck, leading to hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy which resulted in death.

</div> Although the Accused had initially faced a murder charge, the Prosecution eventually proceeded on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief procedural background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Accused admitted to all the foregoing matters which were set out in the Statement of Facts without qualification, and I convicted her on all 28 proceeded charges, after recording her plea of guilt on 23 February 2021. Having heard full submissions on sentencing by the Prosecution, as well as the Defence’s mitigation plea, I adjourned the matter to deliberate on the appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On 2 March 2021, the Accused’s counsel on record (Mr Sunil Sudheesan and Ms Diana Ngiam (collectively “former counsel”)) wrote to inform the court of “certain issues” that had arisen relating to the hearing on 23 February 2021. I convened a case conference on 15 March 2021 where her former counsel applied to discharge themselves from acting for the Accused. I was informed that Mr Joseph Chen (“Mr Chen”) had been instructed by the Accused’s family to act for her in their place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Accused was present at this case conference but she did not appear to have communicated hitherto with Mr Chen or given him any instructions. She appeared undecided as to whether Mr Chen should take over the conduct of her case. In any event, Mr Chen had not been instructed by the Accused or her family to appear on her behalf at the case conference. I therefore convened a further case conference on 30 March 2021 so that Mr Chen could be present as well. On 30 March 2021, the Accused confirmed her intention for Mr Chen to act for her, whereupon I permitted her former counsel to discharge themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Mr Chen formally took over conduct of the matter on 30 March 2021. He stated that his instructions were to further mitigate for the Accused and requested for time to take her instructions. A sentencing mention was scheduled for 29 April 2021 but Mr Chen’s instructions appeared to have shifted after 30 March 2021, from presenting a further plea in mitigation to seeking a reduction of the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge. It would appear from this that the Accused had sought to either qualify or retract her plea of guilt to the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge. After obtaining further clarification from the Accused, Mr Chen confirmed on 29 April 2021 that her instructions to him were not to qualify or retract her plea of guilt but only to further mitigate on her behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The matter was then fixed for a further mention on 22 June 2021. I gave directions for a further written mitigation plea to be filed by 28 May 2021 and for the Prosecution to file reply submissions if necessary by 14 June 2021. Due to additional COVID-related restrictions which affected his ability to see the Accused in May 2021, Mr Chen filed the further plea in mitigation on 8 June 2021 (“the further plea”). The Prosecution informed me that no further written reply submissions on their part were necessary, but reserved their right to make an oral reply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ submissions on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution’s submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Prosecution submitted that the primary sentencing considerations were those of general deterrence and retribution.

In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1287 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span>”) at [26], has also stated that the element of general deterrence “<span class="font-italic">may</span> be given considerably less weight” [emphasis in original], as an offender who suffers from a mental disorder is usually not an appropriate object for exemplary punishment (at [27]). Similarly, the sentencing principle of specific deterrence would generally be of limited application in cases involving mentally disordered offenders, as it is premised on the assumption that the offender can balance and weigh the consequences before committing an offence (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, it is not the case that the element of general deterrence can never be accorded full weight in sentencing a mentally disordered offender, and much would depend on the circumstances of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [35]). Pertinently, the Court of Appeal emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [35] that “[i]f the nature of the mental disorder is such that it does not affect the offender’s capacity to appreciate the gravity and significance of his criminal conduct, the application of the sentencing principle of general deterrence may not be greatly affected”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 With the above observations in mind, it remained apposite in the present case to have regard to the relevant aggravating factors set out by the Court of Appeal when sentencing maid abusers (see <span class="font-italic">ADF</span> at [91]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where serious injury and/or trauma was occasioned;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where there was use of weapons or objects in causing hurt; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the degree of abuse of position or authority;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the prolonged abuse over a period of time, especially if the severity of the abuse escalates over time; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) where mental abuse takes place in conjunction with physical abuse; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the absence of genuine remorse. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The mitigatory weight to be placed on the accused’s psychiatric conditions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Prosecution had characterised the Accused’s acts as “one of the worst (if not the worst) incidents of culpable homicide”,

Here the overriding concern is not so much the protection of the public from a likely repetition by the offender if released, but the need to mete out the maximum punishment to register society’s sheer abhorrence of what the offender has done, to deter others accordingly, and to ensure that the offender’s punishment is therefore proportionate to the utterly sadistic and cruel acts [the offender] did” (see <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It should be noted that <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> had been decided within the framework prior to the 1 February 2008 Penal Code amendments (“the Penal Code Amendments”), where the court was compelled to choose between ten years or life imprisonment as the maximum punishment. A closer examination of the preceding paragraphs of <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span> <span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>at [44]–[46], would show that Chan J had been elaborating on his concerns with this perceived “huge gulf” between ten years and life imprisonment and how the <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criteria might apply. In my view, the observations made in <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> at [47] should thus be read in that context, which has also been recognised implicitly by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [56] and [58]. In this regard, the Court of Appeal has also separately held that the Penal Code Amendments, which have increased the sentencing range under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 20 years’ imprisonment as an alternative to life imprisonment, ensure that the court no longer has to choose between the “two imperfect options” of life imprisonment or ten years’ imprisonment (see <span class="font-italic">Mageswaran</span> at [44]). Accordingly, it is not clear if the observation in <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> that “any other sentence [other than life] is simply too lenient” would still hold true under the current sentencing regime since the wide gap between ten years and life imprisonment has been narrowed by legislative amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Even assuming that the court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> at [47] continue to be valid, it would appear that life imprisonment has not been imposed in any case by our courts where an offender is <span class="font-italic">not</span> deemed to be at risk of reoffending. A clear illustration is the post-<span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>case of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span>, which might have well fallen under the “cruel and inhumane” epithet, as the victim in that case was doused with petrol and set ablaze in a planned and premeditated act. However, even after taking into account the accused’s psychiatric condition, a sentence of 20 years was imposed rather than life imprisonment, even though the offender had previous convictions and was assessed to have had a latent violent disposition, with an attendant risk of recidivism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, Chan J held that as the second <span class="font-italic">Hodgson </span>criteria was not fulfilled and there was no evidence that the offender had abetted a “slow, cruel and painful” killing, a sentence of life imprisonment was not warranted. A sentence of nine years’ imprisonment was imposed instead (see <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span> at [48]–[49] and [53]–[57]). This sentence was upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Aniza bte Essa</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (“<span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”).

<div class="modal-body">
<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Prosecution’s skeletal submissions at [43].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is settled law that the court determines the appropriate sentence based on the charge that is before the court (see <span class="font-italic">Quek Hock Lye v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 1012 at [29]). The fact that the charge in the present case had been reduced from a murder charge, and correspondingly whatever reason(s) the prosecution might have factored in for the purpose of exercising its prosecutorial discretion in reducing the charge, were not relevant considerations in sentencing. It must follow therefore that as a matter of principle, there was no question of double-counting if the Accused’s psychiatric conditions were taken into account in determining the sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The question before the court was how much weight, if any, to attach to her psychiatric conditions. This logically flowed from the Prosecution’s clarification and concession at the hearing. This was in fact the focal point of the court’s enquiry in past cases which were cited by both the Prosecution and Defence, including <span class="font-italic">Aniza</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span>. It is pertinent to note that in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span>, the Court of Appeal had emphatically stated, in the context of a similar charge under s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), that the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is <span class="font-italic">always a relevant factor in the sentencing process</span> (at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This is subject to the qualifier that “[a] mental disorder, even if it substantially impaired the offender’s mental responsibility for the commission of the offence and thereby reduced the offence (in the context of the offence of culpable homicide under s 299 of the [Penal] Code) from that of murder to that of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, cannot be invoked as a blanket excuse for every aspect of the offender’s criminal conduct” (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentence for the s 304(a) charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Evaluating how much weight to attach to an offender’s psychiatric condition in the overall determination of sentence is a fact-specific exercise in each case. Reverting to the facts of the present case, as I have noted earlier, it was necessary to adopt a principled approach and take into account the accused’s psychiatric conditions in determining the appropriate sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, I considered the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criteria. It cannot be disputed that the first and third <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criteria were met in the present case, and it was only the second <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criterion which was material. In this regard, I noted that the Accused previously had four other domestic helpers, and there was no evidence of any complaints against the Accused for abuse or ill-treatment. The Accused did not appear to have been a pathologically violent person prior to the material events. As Dr Derrick Yeo found, this suggested that the onset of her MDD linked to her OCPD at or around the time of the offences was a material factor which contributed to her offending conduct. Dr Derrick Yeo further opined that she was not deemed to be at risk of reoffending.

</div> She did not appear to be of unstable character or to have a propensity to pose a danger to the public. In my view, it was clear that the Accused would not fulfil the second <span class="font-italic">Hodgson</span> criterion, and hence I turned to consider the established sentencing considerations in relation to mentally disordered offenders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Statement of Facts and the accompanying CCTV footage told a shocking story of how the Deceased was abused, humiliated, tortured, starved and eventually made to suffer death at the hands of the Accused. The Deceased, a domestic worker in a foreign land, was completely vulnerable and utterly defenceless, and made to endure agonising physical and psychological harm for a prolonged duration before succumbing to her injuries. The Prosecution’s submissions were framed in forcefully emotive terms, but words cannot adequately describe the abject cruelty of the Accused’s appalling conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In considering if this case fell properly within the description of one of the worst cases of culpable homicide, both (a) the nature of the crime, and (b) the circumstances of the criminal should be examined. While no concrete guideline or rule was purported to be laid down in <span class="font-italic">Mageswaran</span>, the Court of Appeal appeared to have adopted an exclusionary approach, in that in order for a case to be considered as one of the worst cases of culpable homicide, it should generally be found that there was “an absence or at least a lack of material mitigating circumstances” (see <span class="font-italic">Mageswaran</span> at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I agreed with the Prosecution that there were multiple aggravating factors. As noted at [47] above, all the relevant aggravating factors outlined by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ADF</span> at [91] were present. Leaving aside for the moment the Accused’s mood disorders and personality disorder, there were few if any material mitigating factors. Her lack of antecedents, plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities carried little mitigating force. The objective evidence of the relevant facts which gave rise to the charges was cogent and well-captured on CCTV. The Accused could not be regarded as a first offender on account of the fact that she faced 115 charges for separate and distinct offences which covered only the duration of 35 days preceding the Deceased’s death: see <span class="font-italic">Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [15] and [17].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Accused claimed to be remorseful. I was not persuaded that she was indeed genuinely remorseful; her immediate reaction and subsequent conduct upon discovering that the Deceased was unresponsive on the morning of 26 July 2016 certainly was not indicative of any remorse but pure instinctive self-preservation. There was absolutely no remorse in any of the Accused’s actions that morning, when she delayed obtaining proper medical attention for the Deceased and sought to disavow and cover up her role in causing the Deceased’s injuries. This was inconsistent with her claims to have cooperated in the investigations. It would also appear from the various psychiatric reports that she was not prepared to accept responsibility for her actions for at least a considerable period after her arrest.

The Deceased had no handphone or days off. She had no apparent means of contacting anyone for help. She was restrained by being tied up at night by the Accused. When the Accused last brought her for a medical check-up at the GP clinic on 23 May 2016, she took steps to ensure that the Deceased did not raise any complaints to the GP. The Accused was the one who answered all the GP’s questions relating to the Deceased’s physical condition and appearance.

</div> He noted that she thought that she would not face any consequences for her ill-treatment of the Deceased. This last observation was slightly ambiguous, but I understood it to mean that in his assessment, her judgment was affected to the extent that she was reckless or callous with regard to the consequences of her actions. It did not suggest that the Accused did not know that what she was doing was legally or morally wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To be clear, it was not Dr Derrick Yeo’s opinion that the Accused’s psychiatric conditions had directly caused her to commit the offences. Nonetheless, the undisputed fact was that her psychiatric conditions had substantially contributed to the commission of the offences. Crucially, as noted above at [61], Dr Derrick Yeo had opined that she was responsive to psychiatric treatment and was unlikely to reoffend. She was unlikely to pose a serious danger to the public. These were important distinguishing factors that set her case apart from the precedents cited where life imprisonment was imposed. For these reasons primarily, I did not think that life imprisonment would be fair or appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 That being said, I did not accept that the mitigating force of her psychiatric conditions was so substantial or compelling as to warrant a sentence of less than 20 years in relation to the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge. Her alleged state of heightened anxiety over her children’s medical conditions could not be said to reduce her culpability. As I had explained above at [66], her children’s various illnesses had no palpably clear link to any perceived poor hygiene practices on the part of the Deceased. There were also past assaults including the incident with the heated iron forming the subject-matter of the s 325 charge which had nothing to do with the Deceased’s standards of hygiene. In any case, the Accused’s liberal resort to routine beatings and brutal attacks on the Deceased, some of which were committed in full view of her children, were hardly justifiable means of disciplining the Deceased for any perceived lapses in her work or hygiene standards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 While Dr Derrick Yeo had assessed that the Accused’s judgment was impaired by her depressed state compounded by her OCPD, he determined that the impact on her judgment lay in her “thinking that she would not face any consequences” for her ill-treatment of the Deceased. Crucially, although Dr Derrick Yeo concluded that her mental responsibility was partially impaired, he assessed her to be able to exercise conscious deliberation and volitional control throughout the commission of her offences.

They reflected an utter lack of any basic humanity. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused had treated the Deceased as a lesser human being. In my assessment, what the Accused had done to the Deceased demonstrated that she had callously regarded the Deceased as <span class="font-italic">even l</span><span class="font-italic">ess</span> than a human being. In her final hours, the Deceased was kicked, strangled, pulled by her hair, stomped upon and punched like a punching bag or some inanimate object. In the 35 days leading up to her death, she had endured repeated assaults, including being lifted and dragged by her hair and being spun round like a rag doll by the Accused. This much was incontrovertibly revealed from the CCTV footage alone. The Deceased was defenceless. She was at the total mercy of the Accused. The Accused showed no mercy whatsoever.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this connection, I differed from Dr Derrick Yeo’s opinion that the Accused had treated the Deceased “like a child to be physically disciplined, in order to achieve her goal of good hygiene practices and cleanliness, with the main goal of preventing her children from falling ill due to contamination”.

</div> This may have been his assessment after taking into account the Accused’s self-reported circumstances and motivations. However, the numerous savage and vicious attacks captured on CCTV footage, and in particular where the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) offence was concerned, did not suggest at all that the Accused had only thought that she was merely disciplining a wilfully disobedient child.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 By the Accused’s own account, the underlying reasons for her criminal conduct were founded on fact, namely her dissatisfaction with the Deceased’s perceived lapses, spurred by her depression and fixation over hygiene and cleanliness. In line with the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Kong Peng Yee</span> [2018] 2 SLR 295 at [65], her psychiatric conditions could “only ameliorate to a limited extent the criminal conduct because [her mind was] still rational”. The Court of Appeal went on to hold that in such cases, “deterrence and retribution should still feature because <span class="font-italic">depression, even if severe, cannot be a licence to kill or harm others</span>” [emphasis added] (at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Accused was fully cognisant of her actions and purposeful in her criminal conduct. She intended to inflict untold pain and suffering on the Deceased ostensibly as “punishment” for her perceived shortcomings. In my view, the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghim Peow</span> at [35] were also apposite: the nature of the Accused’s psychiatric conditions was ultimately not such that they affected her capacity to appreciate the gravity and significance of her criminal conduct, even if her judgment may have been affected so as to cause her to think that she could continue abusing the Deceased with impunity and not have to face any consequences. Thus, while her culpability may have been attenuated, it remained high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Accused further argued that the plight of her young children in being deprived of her maternal care while she is incarcerated should be considered on compassionate grounds in sentencing. It is well-established in law that personal or family hardship are not mitigating factors unless there are clearly exceptional reasons for taking them into account (see <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [11]-[12]; <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Kang v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 254 at [5]; <span class="font-italic">Leaw</span><span class="font-italic"> Siat Chong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 646 at [12];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 at [73]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On the related issue of a gag order raised in the further plea, I was unable to find any justification or legal basis for the gag order she had sought in order to protect her children from stigmatisation. The fact that there was significant media and public interest in this case did not constitute a valid reason for either a gag order or for a lighter sentence. There is no recognised principle in law that calls for a gag order in such circumstances. Equally, it cannot be right that the court’s sentencing determination, whether weighing on the side of the Prosecution or that of the Accused, is calibrated according to the intensity of media scrutiny or public interest. These considerations do not dictate how the sentencing court should decide, whether in the case of a crime of grossly shocking proportions or a relatively minor offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I concluded that retribution and general deterrence were the sentencing principles that took centre stage in the present case. Having balanced the various sentencing considerations and weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors, I found that a sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment in respect of the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge was appropriate. It was not manifestly excessive but was proportionate to the Accused’s offence, and it accorded due consideration to her mental disorders which had substantially contributed to her commission of the offences.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentences for the remaining charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As a starting point in addressing the sentences for the remaining charges, I kept in mind the principles laid down by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”). The one transaction rule was completely inapplicable as this was not a case involving a single or isolated invasion of the same legally protected interest. It would not make sense to consider that the various offences might somehow be said to have been unified by the same purpose or design. Even though the Deceased was the sole victim, each offence was separate and distinct in character and in terms of the time of commission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For the 22 charges under s 323 read with s 73(2), and s 323 read with s 73(2) and either s 34 or s 109, they involved varying degrees of harm and culpability. It would not be wholly appropriate to impose the same sentence for each and every charge. Having regard to the framework I had set out in <span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1315 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]–[75] in relation to sentencing cases of domestic maid abuse, it was plain that the Accused’s sustained pattern of offending was systematically abusive and oppressive. I had no doubt that the appropriate sentences would fall within the higher end of the sentencing spectrum.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I imposed sentences pegged at between 18 months’ and two years’ imprisonment, depending on the extent and duration of the hurt involved in the respective charges, bearing in mind both the physical harm and the significant psychological harm that was indubitably inflicted on the Deceased (<span class="font-italic">Tay Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat</span> at [71]–[72]).

For the s 352, s 341 and s 506 charges (DAC-902724-2018, DAC-902830-2018 and DAC-902770-2018), I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of one month’s, one month’s and three months’ imprisonment for each of these respective charges was warranted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Where the s 325 charge (DAC-902842-2018) was concerned, the Prosecution submitted for at least three years’ imprisonment. The only related sentencing precedent involving an employer effectively starving a foreign domestic worker appears to be <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lim Choon Hong and another </span>[2017] 5 SLR 989. However, that case involved prosecution for a far less serious offence under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”) read with reg 4(2) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (S 569/2012), punishable under s 22(1)(i) of the EFMA which carries a maximum imprisonment term of only 12 months. As the maximum permissible imprisonment term for the present s 325 offence is 15 years, with the added element of endangering life, I was of the view that a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was amply justified. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consecutive sentences and the totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I considered that the general rule enunciated by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan</span> [2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) at [41] and [48] was broadly applicable in the present case. The Accused was a multiple offender who ought to be separately punished for each offence, but bearing in mind the totality principle, it would be entirely out of the question to order the individual sentences for all or even a substantial number of the 28 proceeded charges to run consecutively. This would lead to a crushing and wholly disproportionate sentence by any standard. It would violate the general rule against double counting aggravating factors given that multiple offences were involved. These factors would already have been taken into account at the first stage of the sentencing process in dealing with the appropriate individual sentences: see <span class="font-italic">ADF</span> at [92] and <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [79]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As such, at the second and third stage of the sentencing analysis set out by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span> at [98], I determined that at least five sentences ought to run consecutively in view of the Accused’s overall criminality. I concluded thus after having given careful and deliberative thought in relation to the relevant sentencing considerations, including the Accused’s psychiatric conditions. I therefore ordered the sentences in respect of five charges to run consecutively, namely those for the: s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge (HC 900118/2016: 20 years’ imprisonment), s 324 charge (DAC-902753-2018: three years’ imprisonment), s 325 charge (DAC-902842-2018: three years’ imprisonment) and two s 323 charges (DAC-902815-2018 and 902821-2018: two years’ imprisonment each). The aggregate sentence was 30 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 With the sentence backdated to the Accused’s date of arrest on 26 July 2016, subject to remission, she would effectively be incarcerated for another 15 years or so.

General rather than specific deterrence was of particular concern. At the same time, the sentencing court must not ignore the circumstances of an offender who has relevant and significant psychiatric conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Notwithstanding the Accused’s psychiatric conditions, she was cognisant of her actions and purposeful in her conduct. She did not lack capacity to comprehend what she was doing. To recapitulate, the 115 charges spanned only the final 35 days of the Deceased’s life. From the Statement of Facts and the accompanying CCTV footage, it was clear beyond peradventure that the Accused had waged a brutally dehumanising campaign of violence against the Deceased. She relentlessly inflicted pain and suffering on the Deceased as “punishment” for her perceived lapses. The Accused did so without compunction until she caused the death of the Deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The overall picture before me led me to conclude that an extended custodial sentence had to be imposed. The sentence had to signal clearly societal outrage and abhorrence of these offences. Though I was not persuaded that the Accused was deserving of life imprisonment for the s 304(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge, an extended sentence would neither be crushing nor disproportionate in light of the gravity of the offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For the above reasons, I ordered that the sentences in respect of five charges to run consecutively, as stated at [90] above. The aggregate sentence was therefore 30 years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The sentence was backdated to 26 July 2016, the date of the Accused’s arrest. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal SC, Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Stephanie Koh (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the Accused (up to 30 March 2021);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Chen (Joseph Chen &amp; Co) for the Accused (wef 30 March 2021).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
