<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><i><b>The charge</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">1 The appellant, Khalid bin Abdul Rashid, was tried before the High

Court on a charge that he, on or about 14 March 2000 at about 6.45pm at Block 634 Bedok

Reservoir Road, #04-11, Singapore, trafficked by having in his possession for the purposes

of trafficking, not less than 21.37g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with

a 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (‘the

MDA’).</p>
<p align="justify">2 At the end of the trial, the learned trial judge found the appellant

guilty, convicted and sentenced him to suffer death. The appellant’s appeal against

his conviction and sentence was dismissed by us and our reasons now follow.</p>
<p><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify">Facts</p>
<p align="justify">3 The evidence adduced by the prosecution which was in effect not

challenged by the appellant was that on 14 March 2000 at about 5.35pm, he was arrested by

a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) along a corridor at the

Singapore National University Hospital. After his arrest, he was taken to his

sister’s flat at Block 634 Bedok Reservoir Road, #04-11, Singapore. There, under the

bed in the appellant’s bedroom, the CNB officers found a travelling bag with a lock

at the end of the zipper. The appellant assisted the officers to locate a key to unlock

the bag inside which they discovered the following items:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Ten envelopes (B13) containing a total of 99 small transparent

  sachets of granular substance;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Six brown packets (B7 to B12) inside which was a total of 357 small

  transparent sachets of granular substance; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Six transparent packets also containing granular substance (B1 to

  B6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4 Also found in the seized bag were implements suggestive of drug

trafficking such as aluminium foil, envelopes, sticky tapes, a pair of gloves and a razor

blade.</p>
<p align="justify">5 Scientific analysis carried out by the Department of Forensic Science

established the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The granular substance in the ten envelopes (B13) (ie, 99 sachets)

  had a gross weight of 763.4g and upon analysis was found to contain not less than 1.80g of

  diamorphine;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The granular substance (ie, 357 sachets) in the six brown packets

  (B7 to B12) yielded a gross weight of 2,787g and upon analysis was found to contain not

  less than 8.59g of diamorphine; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The granular substance in the six transparent packets (B1 to B6)

  had a gross weight of 2,762g and upon analysis was found to contain not less than 10.98g

  of diamorphine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">6 In the result, the gross weight of all the granular substance found

in the seized bag was 6,312.4g and the nett total diamorphine content of all the substance

seized was 21.37g.</p>
<p align="justify">7 At the trial, upon the application of the prosecution, a number of

statements made by the appellant were admitted in evidence as being made voluntarily. In

these statements the appellant admitted to having been in possession of the drugs found in

the bag; neither the admissibility nor the authorship of the statements was challenged by

the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">8 At the close of the prosecution’s case, the learned trial judge

correctly ruled that the prosecution had established a prima facie case which if

unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the appellant on the charge he faced. The

standard allocution was administered, the courses open to the appellant were explained and

thereafter the trial judge called on the appellant to enter upon his defence.</p>
<p><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify">Defence</p>
<p align="justify">9 In his defence, the appellant did not endeavour to materially resile

from what he had told the CNB in his statements. He admitted that the offending drugs

found in his possession were collected by him from his supplier "Glass" two or

three days before his arrest. He claimed however, that he was a heroin addict and that

having smoked some of the substance he had collected from "Glass" and having

found them to be of poor quality, he had decided to retain the six brown packets (B7 to

B12) for his consumption. It should be observed presently that the gross weight of the

said six packets was 2,787g and their nett diamorphine content was 8.59g.</p>
<p align="justify">10 The appellant testified that during the period of about a month

before he was arrested, his rate of consumption of heroin was about half a sachet per day.

Although half a sachet per day was the appellant’s normal rate of consumption, he

claimed that owing to the poor quality of the drugs he had with him, his rate of

consumption from the present consignment was about four or five sachets per day.</p>
<p align="justify">11 The appellant further claimed that he was unemployed at the time of

his arrest. He said that he had agreed to hold and deliver drugs for "Glass"

because he needed the money to fund his drug addiction. He asserted that he intended to

sell and deliver the drugs found in the ten envelopes (B13) and the six transparent

packets (B1 to B6) with a view to buying the drugs in the six brown packets (B7 to B12)

for his own consumption. The appellant testified that although "Glass" had asked

him to sell each brown packet of drugs (B7 to B12) for $2,750.00, "Glass" had

promised to sell to him each packet at a discounted price of less than $2,000 if the drugs

were for his own consumption.</p>
<p align="justify">12 The prosecution did not and would not concede that the appellant was

a heroin addict. To support this, the prosecution to some extent relied on the evidence of

the investigating officer that the appellant appeared normal at the time of his arrest as

well as that of the evidence of doctors who examined the appellant just before and after

his statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (‘CPC’)

were taken. The learned trial judge, however, did not accept the contention of the

prosecution in this regard. He found that the accused’s records spoke volumes about

his drug problems. Having considered the opinion of Dr Leow Kee Fong, a government doctor

who examined the appellant three days after his arrest, stating that the appellant was a

mild heroin addict and the evidence of Dr Lim Yun Chin, a consultant psychatrist produced

by the defence, who opined that the appellant was an active heroin-dependent individual,

based on the appellant’s drug history and what the appellant had told him, the

learned trial judge accepted the appellant’s claim that he was indeed a heroin

addict.</p>
<p align="justify">13 As to the amount the appellant was consuming each day prior to his

arrest, there was indeed a measure of prevarication in the evidence of the appellant. In

this regard, it was observed by the learned trial judge that the appellant had told Dr

Leow that he was consuming half a packet per day but in court he claimed that he was

smoking about four to five packets per day. However, in his statements he had said that he

consumed only half a sachet of heroin per day. Having noted the explanation of the

appellant that the quality of the heroin in the consignment under reference was rather low

and that he needed four to five sachets to get high, the learned judge was prepared to

accept the claim of the appellant that prior to his arrest he had smoked four to five

packets a day to get high. This, however, did not dispose the matter at hand in favour of

the appellant for the issue before the trial court was not how many sachets the appellant

was consuming per day but whether the appellant had on the balance of probabilities

established that the six brown packets (B7 to B12) were not for trafficking but for his

own consumption. </p>
<p><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify">Decision by the trial judge</p>
<p align="justify">14 In the end, after giving careful consideration to all the evidence,

the trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence. The learned judge’s concluding

comments in this regard bear reproduction and were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The issue that I now have to consider is whether the accused’s

  claim that B7 to B12 were not for trafficking but were for his own consumption should be

  accepted bearing in mind that the burden was on the accused on a balance of probabilities

  to establish that that was so.</p>
<p align="justify">The accused in this case was a drug addict who had spent considerable

  time under detention for his drug addiction. He was unemployed and did not have any

  assets. By his own testimony, he agreed to hold and deliver drugs for "Glass"

  because he needed money to fund his drug addiction. No evidence was led by the prosecution

  as to what the street value of the drugs in the consignment found on him was but the

  accused’s testimony was that each durian [<i>the term used the appellant to refer to

  a packet of heroin</i>] was worth $2,750. The 14 durians in the consignment that the

  accused received would therefore be worth $38,500. The street value of the 6 durians that

  the accused claimed were for his own consumption would be approximately $16,500. Even

  allowing for any special discounts on the price that the accused may obtain from

  "Glass", that is an inordinately large sum of money for a person in the

  accused’s financial circumstances to come by. The accused explained that he would

  raise this sum of money from the profits he would obtain by selling the 99 sachets found

  in the 10 envelopes. I find this explanation difficult to accept. It is made even more

  implausible by the fact that the accused had not even told "Glass" that he would

  be retaining 6 out of the 14 packets for his own consumption. Nor did the accused in his

  CNB statements make any reference to the 6 packets being for his own consumption. I

  therefore do not accept the defence that these packets were for his own personal

  consumption. If at all any part of the consignment was for the accused’s own

  consumption, it would certainly not be in the order of 6 packets and would not be of an

  amount that would reduce the amount of diamorphine in his possession for the purposes of

  trafficking to anywhere near 15g, leave alone below 15g. I therefore reject the defence

  raised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
<p align="justify">15 The primary contention in this appeal was that the learned trial

judge had erred in rejecting the evidence of the appellant that the six brown packets of

drugs (which contained 8.59g of diamorphine) were meant for his own consumption on account

of the low quality of the drugs in question.</p>
<p align="justify">16 The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant in this regard was

that an addict with the appellant’s history and background would have to consume more

in view of the low heroin concentration of the consignment which he was in possession of.

It was further suggested that there was nothing extraordinary for a drug addict with such

a long history of addiction to hoard such an amount of drugs for his personal consumption.

It was also contended by counsel for the appellant that although the gross weight of these

six packets of heroin was 2,787g, their pure heroin content was only 8.59g, ie, only 0.3%

purity.</p>
<p align="justify">17 In the appeal before us, it was never in doubt that the appellant

was in possession of the offending substance which upon analysis was found to contain not

less than 21.37g of diamorphine. It was also not in dispute that the appellant knew the

nature of the drugs he was in possession of. Consequently, by operation of s 17 of the

MDA, he was presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of

trafficking unless it was proven that his possession of the drug was not for that purpose.

The burden was thus on the appellant to rebut this presumption by establishing on the

balance of probabilities that the six brown packets of drugs (B7 to B12) found in his

possession were not for trafficking but for his own consumption: <i><b>Aziz bin Abdul

Kadir v Public Prosecutor</b></i> <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 175</nobr> at 189; <i><b>Chia Song Heng v Public

Prosecutor</b></i> <nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 705</nobr> at 706.</p>
<p align="justify">18 To rebut the presumption of trafficking and to establish that a

portion of the drugs in his possession was for consumption and not for trafficking, an

accused had to adduce credible evidence to show that part of the offending substance was

intended for self-consumption and in this regard a mere casual declaration by the accused

would not suffice. He would have to, in addition to the history of his addiction and

consumption habits, also satisfy the trial court of the rates of his consumption. If all

that the accused could conjure up was a bare allegation bereft of details, the trial judge

would be well entitled to reject his evidence as unworthy of belief and an appellate court

would be most reluctant to disturb any such finding: <i><b>Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v

Public Prosecutor</b></i> <nobr>[1996] 3 SLR 29</nobr> at 39; <i><b>Fung Choon Kay v Public Prosecutor</b></i>
<nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 564</nobr> at 572. Another factor which would weigh in the mind of the court is the

financial means or the ability of the accused to pay for the drugs: <i><b>Public

Prosecutor v Dahalan bin Ladaewa</b></i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 783</nobr> at 814.</p>
<p align="justify">19 Reverting to the appeal before us, we were of the view that the

learned trial judge’s evaluation of the evidence and the findings thereon were

flawless and beyond reproach. His conclusion that the appellant was financially incapable

of retaining the six ‘durians’ using the appellant’s own estimate of

current street price amounted to about $16,500 was also unassailable. The cost of the six

packets, even allowing a generous discount his supplier "Glass" allegedly

promised him or might have allowed him, would still set him back with a figure beyond his

reach for he was by his own admission unemployed at the material time. Given the context,

the learned trial judge’s conclusion that it would entail an inordinately large sum

of money for a person in the accused’s financial circumstances to come by, could not

be faulted. The learned trial judge also rejected the explanation of the appellant that he

would raise this sum of money from the profits he would obtain by selling the 99 sachets

found in the ten envelopes as unworthy of credit owing to the fact that the appellant had

not even told his supplier that he would be retaining the said six packets for his use.</p>
<p align="justify">20 We agree with the learned trial judge that the explanations

attempted by the appellant at the trial that the six packets were for his own consumption

did not feature anywhere in his CNB statements nor did the appellant proffer this

explanation in his s 122(6) CPC statement when charged with the offence. His failure to

mention such a material aspect naturally led the trial judge to conclude, as he did in

this case, that his present claim that these packets were meant for his personal

consumption was implausible and therefore rejected. In this connection, we hasten to

reiterate what the Court of Appeal observed in <i><b>Goh Soon Huat v Public Prosecutor</b></i>
<nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 634</nobr> at 640:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… it is not necessary for the appellant to minutely detail all his

  defences in his s 122(6) statement. However, accepting this proposition does not mean that

  the court must accept what the appellant said as true. This must still be weighed against

  the other evidence. It may not always be clear when an omission to state details becomes

  an omission to state material particulars. This is a matter for the trial judge on an

  evaluation of all the evidence at the trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21 In the appeal before us, the grounds of appeal averted to were

solely concerned with the trial judge’s findings of fact. It is trite law that as the

trial court has the advantage of hearing evidence and observing the demeanour of

witnesses, an appellate court would generally be slow to disturb the findings of the trial

court. Nonetheless, the appellate court would intervene where the findings are clearly

wrong or the balance of evidence is against the conclusion reached by the trial court or

where the inferences drawn by the trial court are not supported by the primary facts on

the record or where upon available evidence, no tribunal acting judicially and properly

instructed on relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal: <i><b>Opium

Farm v Chin Ah Quee</b></i> 4 SLJ 33 at 35; <i><b>Chia Han Kiat v R</b></i> <nobr>[1937] MLJ 261</nobr>

at 261; <i><b>Goh Ah San v R</b></i> <nobr>[1938] MLJ 95</nobr> at 99; <i><b>In re AB Ltd</b></i>
<nobr>[1956] MLJ 197</nobr> at 200; <i><b>Tan Choon Huat v PP</b></i> <nobr>[1991] 1 SLR 805</nobr> at 808; <i><b>Tan

Hung Yeoh v PP</b></i> <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 93</nobr> at 103 and <i><b>Chng Gim Huat v PP</b></i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 262</nobr> at 277. </p>
<p align="justify">22 The facts and issues raised in the appeal before us bear some

resemblance to the case of <i><b>Fung Choon Kay v Public Prosecutor</b></i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 565</nobr>, where the Court of Appeal observed at page 571 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… Although the fact that the appellant was an addict lent support

  to the appellant’s defence of consumption, that fact by itself was not conclusive.

  The trial judge had to look at the totality of the evidence and decide whether he was

  satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that part of the heroin was for the

  appellant’s own consumption. Here, apart from the medical evidence, the appellant was

  unable to adduce any independent evidence to support his testimony in court that part of

  the heroin was for self-consumption. Much thus depended on the trial judge’s

  assessment of the appellant’s credibility. The trial judge had the advantage of

  seeing the appellant give evidence in the witness box and was in the best position to

  gauge his credibility. An appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb his finding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">23 Although the appellant was found to be a drug addict and even if it

could be assumed that he was consuming four to five sachets a day prior to his arrest,

these factors by themselves were, in our determination, not sufficient to warrant the view

that those six packets were not for the purposes of trafficking. In our evaluation, the

learned trial judge had carefully considered the entire spectrum of defence raised and in

the end had seen fit to reject it on the basis that the accounts narrated by the appellant

defied credence.</p>
<p align="justify">24 In our judgment, the prosecution had amply discharged the onus

placed on it by proving the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The

statutory presumption that he trafficked in that quantity of drugs arose under s 17 of the

MDA and as the trial judge found, he had not rebutted the presumption on the balance of

probabilities. On this, we entirely agreed with the learned trial judge. There was no

merit in the appeal and we accordingly dismissed it.<i></i></p>
