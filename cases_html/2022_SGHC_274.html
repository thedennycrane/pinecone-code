The dispute was over who had a prior right to the bankrupt’s share of the surplus proceeds. The contest was between the bankrupt’s estate and a judgment creditor who had registered an order of court attaching the bankrupt’s interest in the property and issued a writ of seizure and sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The bankrupt in question was Mdm Aparna Donti (“Aparna”). The claimant in these proceedings was Mr Abuthahir s/o Abdul Gafoor, the private trustee in bankruptcy (the “Private Trustee”) of the estate of Aparna Donti (the “Estate”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The defendant, Bangkok Bank Public Co Ltd, a judgment creditor of Aparna, had attached Aparna’s interest in a property in Singapore at 5A Shenton Way #09-23 (the “Property”) and issued a writ of seizure and sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Two other creditors of Aparna – Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (“OCBC”) and Indian Overseas Bank (“IOB”) – participated in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 For reasons set out below, I decided in favour of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Aparna and her husband, Mr Thanikesh Aravindan (“Thanikesh”) jointly owned the Property. They also owned a company called Straits Global Pte Ltd (“Straits Global”). Both of them were co-guarantors in respect of credit facilities granted to Straits Global by several banks, including the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Straits Global was unable to repay the loans and was wound up on 7 August 2020. Thanikesh was adjudged a bankrupt on 1 October 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 5 February 2021, the defendant entered judgment in default of appearance against Aparna in the sum of US$2,364,330.50 (the “Judgment”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In April 2021, the mortgagee of the Property, Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd (“SCB”), repossessed the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 22 April 2021, the defendant obtained an order of court for Aparna’s interest in the Property to be attached and taken in execution to satisfy the Judgment (the “Attachment Order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 14 May 2021, the Attachment Order was registered with the Singapore Land Authority. On 8 June 2021, the defendant issued a writ of seizure and sale in respect of Aparna’s interest in the Property (the “WSS”). Subsequently, the defendant’s solicitors informed the Sheriff that the mortgagee (SCB) had taken steps to sell the Property. At the defendant’s request, the Sheriff took no further steps on the WSS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 5 July 2021, OCBC commenced bankruptcy proceedings against Aparna. On 13 July 2021, the defendant’s solicitors informed OCBC’s solicitors that (a) Aparna’s interest in the Property had been attached and taken in execution; (b) the Attachment Order was registered with the Registrar of Land Titles on 14 May 2021; and (c) the defendant had requested SCB’s solicitors to pay the surplus proceeds from the sale of the Property to the Sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 9 September 2021, Aparna was adjudged a bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 14 September 2021, OCBC’s solicitors informed the Sheriff that:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a bankruptcy order had been made against Aparna; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) pursuant to s 368(4) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (No 40 of 2018) (“IRDA”), the surplus proceeds should be paid to the Private Trustee.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 23 September 2021, the Sheriff wrote to the Private Trustee, saying that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [Property] was seized on 6-May-2021 pursuant to the [WSS].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. As we are now made aware that [Aparna] is adjundged [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] bankrupt … the seized property is handed over to you for administration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 27 September 2021, the defendant’s solicitors wrote to the Sheriff, stating, among other things, that:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the defendant’s execution against Aparna’s interest in the Property was deemed to have been completed before Aparna was adjudged a bankrupt; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) pursuant to s 367 of the IRDA, the defendant was entitled to retain the surplus proceeds against the Private Trustee.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 14 January 2022, the Sheriff informed the Private Trustee that having reconsidered the matter, “the Sheriff’s Office no longer takes the position stated in [its] letter dated 23 September 2021”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On 28 January 2022, the mortgagee sale of the Property was completed.

Any remaining balance would be distributed to the other creditors.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) No adverse costs orders would be sought regardless of the outcome of the application.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I agreed with the Private Trustee that the funding agreement should be approved (see <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard Energy Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 4 SLR 597) and ordered accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues relating to the Surplus Proceeds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The issues relating to the Surplus Proceeds concerned ss 367, 368(3) and 368(4) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 367 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restriction of rights of creditor under execution or attachment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">367.</span>—(1) Where the creditor of a bankrupt has issued execution against the goods or lands of the bankrupt or has attached any debt due or property belonging to the bankrupt, the creditor is not entitled to retain the benefit of the execution or attachment against the Official Assignee unless the creditor has completed the execution or attachment before the date of the bankruptcy order, except that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) For the purposes of this Act —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) an execution against land or any interest in land is completed by registering under any written law relating to the registration of land a writ of seizure and sale attaching the interest of the bankrupt in the land described in the writ of seizure and sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Private Trustee and OCBC agreed with the defendant that the defendant had completed its execution against Aparna’s interest in the Property when it registered the Attachment Order, and that on the basis of s 367 alone, the defendant would be entitled to the Surplus Proceeds. However, IOB contended that execution would be completed only when the Sheriff sold the seized property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As for ss 368(3) and 368(4) of the IRDA, the provisions are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duties of Sheriff as to property taken in execution</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">368.</span>—…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where a writ of seizure and sale has been issued in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding $2,000, the Sheriff must hold all moneys coming to the Sheriff’s hands under the writ of seizure and sale for 14 days starting from the receipt of the moneys.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) If within the time mentioned in subsection (3) —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) notice is served on the Sheriff of a bankruptcy application having been made against or by the debtor; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) a bankruptcy order is made against the debtor on the bankruptcy application or on any other application of which the Sheriff has notice,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the Sheriff must deduct the costs of and incidental to the execution and pay the balance to the Official Assignee, who is entitled to retain the same as against the execution creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 If s 367(1) applied to this case, the defendant would be entitled to the Surplus Proceeds. However, if s 368(4) applied to this case, the Private Trustee would be entitled to the Surplus Proceeds. The Private Trustee and OCBC contended that s 368(4) was the applicable provision in this case and that therefore the Private Trustee was entitled to the Surplus Proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The issues before me were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) When was the defendant’s execution against Aparna’s interest in the Property completed?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Whether s 367(1) or s 368(4) of the IRDA applied in this case?</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">When was the defendant’s execution against Aparna’s interest in the Property completed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It should be noted that under the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (the “2014 Rules”), execution against immovable property involves the following steps:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the judgment creditor has to apply for an order of court in Form 96 attaching the judgment debtor’s interest in the immovable property under O 47 r 4(1) of the 2014 Rules (the “Form 96 order”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Seizure is then effected by registering the Form 96 order under the relevant written law relating to the immovable property; upon registration, the debtor’s interest is deemed to be seized by the Sheriff: O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the 2014 Rules.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) After registering the Form 96 order, the judgment creditor must “file a writ of seizure and sale in Form 83” and an undertaking, declaration and indemnity in Form 87: O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(i) and O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(ii) of the 2014 Rules. Although described as a writ of seizure and sale, Form 83 in fact operates as a direction to the Sheriff, if necessary, to sell the interest in the immovable property to satisfy the judgment debt. As stated above, seizure is effected by registering the Form 96 order. Form 83 itself acknowledges that the interest in the immovable property has been seized.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Sheriff must then serve a copy of the writ of seizure and sale together with the Form 96 order and the notice of seizure in Form 97 on the judgment debtor: O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii) of the 2014 Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The sale of the immovable property or any interest therein is subject to certain conditions set out in O 47 r 5 of the 2014 Rules, which includes a condition that there shall be no sale until the expiration of 30 days from the date of registration of the Form 96 order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Under s 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA (see [24] above), execution against land or any interest in land is completed by the registration of a writ of seizure and sale. It was not disputed that the “writ of seizure and sale” referred to in s 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is the Form 96 order. It was also not disputed that the Attachment Order in this case (see [10] above) was a Form 96 order and that it had been properly registered with the Singapore Land Authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 IOB submitted that execution is completed under s 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) only upon sale by the Sheriff. IOB argued that this was so because, pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the 2014 Rules (see [29(c)] above), a sale of the land under execution was always intended to follow after the registration of the Form 96 order. IOB reasoned that the registration of the Form 96 order was meant to facilitate the Sheriff’s power of sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I disagreed with IOB’s submission. It is true that execution of a judgment by way of a writ of seizure and sale contemplates both seizure and sale so that the proceeds of sale can be used to satisfy the judgment debt. Nevertheless, the language in s 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA is crystal clear – for purposes of the IRDA, an execution against land or any interest in land is completed by registering the order attaching the land or interest in land under the appropriate written law. Section 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA is simply not capable of being interpreted in the manner contended for by IOB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, it was unarguable that pursuant to s 367(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, the defendant completed its execution against Aparna’s interest in the Property on 14 May 2021 when the Attachment Order was registered with the Singapore Land Authority. As stated earlier, this was also the position taken by the Private Trustee and OCBC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether s 367(1) or s 368(4) of the IRDA applied in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Section 368(4) requires the Sheriff to be notified of the bankruptcy application and the bankruptcy order to be made “within the time mentioned in subsection (3)” (see [26] above). The time mentioned in s 368(3) is the period of 14 days starting from the Sheriff’s receipt of the moneys <span class="font-italic">under the writ of seizure and sale</span> (the “14-day period”). This means the seized property must first be sold pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Section 368(4) then states that the Official Assignee is entitled to the balance proceeds of sale if the Sheriff is notified of the bankruptcy application, and the bankruptcy order is made, within the 14-day period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Therefore, for s 368(4) to apply: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a writ of seizure and sale must have been filed;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the seized property must have been sold pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the Sheriff must have received the proceeds of the sale; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the Sheriff must have been notified of the bankruptcy application, and the bankruptcy order must have been made, within the 14-day period. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(i) of the 2014 Rules clearly states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) after registering the [Form 96] order, the judgment creditor must ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) file a writ of seizure and sale in Form 83 … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, the judgment creditor would have had to register its Form 96 order <span class="font-italic">before</span> filing the writ of seizure and sale. This means that any case that falls within s 368(4) would also fall within s 367(1). Yet, the party entitled to the balance proceeds of sale under s 367(1) is the judgment creditor whilst under s 368(4) it is the Official Assignee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The only way to reconcile s 367(1) and s 368(4) is to restrict s 367(1) to cases which do not fall within s 368(4). However, there appears to be no apparent reason justifying such a distinction and s 367(1) and s 368(4) should perhaps be reviewed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 That said, it was unnecessary for me to resolve the inconsistency between s 367(1) and s 368(4) in the present case. I agreed with the defendant that on the facts, the present case did not fall within s 368(4). The Property was sold by the mortgagee; it was not sold by the Sheriff under the WSS. There was therefore no “moneys coming to the Sheriff’s hands under the writ of seizure and sale” for the purpose of s 368(3). Thus, the commencement of the 14-day period was not triggered and neither the notification of the bankruptcy application to the Sheriff nor the making of the bankruptcy order could be said to have been made “within the time mentioned in subsection (3)”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I therefore concluded that s 368(4) did not apply in the present case; instead, s 367(1) was the applicable provision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the above reasons, I found that the defendant was entitled to the Surplus Proceeds in priority to the Private Trustee. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Hui Li Debby and Cheng Si Yuan Shaun (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Loong Tse Chuan and Yew Wei Li Avery (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Kia Jeng and Ooi Shu Min (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the first non-party;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Cong Yen Lionel and Caleb Tan Jia Chween (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the second non-party.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
