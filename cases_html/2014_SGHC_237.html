<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a case arising out of a family dispute
                    over the estate of Kuek Ser Beng (“KSB”), who passed away on 30
                    January 2007 without leaving a will. The plaintiff, Kuek Siew Chew (“the
                    Plaintiff”), is a daughter of KSB, while the defendants, Kuek Siang Wei
                    (“KSW”) and Kuek Tsing Hsia (“KTH”) (referred to
                    collectively as “the Defendants”), are the grandchildren of KSB.
                    The Defendants are the administrators of KSB’s estate. The central dispute
                    in the present case pertained to the validity of three instruments – a
                    letter of consent, a deed of consent and a deed of family arrangement. The
                    primary effect of these instruments was to allow KSB’s estate to be
                    distributed in accordance with an unsigned note purportedly written by KSB. The
                    trial took place over a period of six days and I reserved judgment upon the
                    conclusion of the trial. Having considered both the evidence and the
                    parties’ submissions, I allowed the Plaintiff’s claim in part. The
                    letter of consent, deed of consent and deed of family arrangement were set aside
                    and KSB’s estate was to be distributed in accordance with the rules set
                    out in the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed) (“the
                    ISA”). The Defendants have since filed an appeal against my decision and
                    I now set out the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the outset, it is observed that the dispute
                    between the parties involved a mix of both factual and legal issues. While it is
                    recognised that the parties have given a relatively comprehensive and
                    wide-ranging account of the events that had taken place over the course of
                    almost six years after KSB’s demise back in 2007, for the purposes of this
                    decision, I will only focus on the facts that are relevant to the issues at
                    hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dramatis personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I will first begin with a brief description of
                    the main persons involved in the present dispute:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     KSB: KSB passed away on 30 January
                        2007 without leaving a will. He was married to Lim Swee (“LS”)
                        and they had three children. KSB also had a second family with Goh Ah Pi
                        (“GAP”) and they had five children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     LS: The late wife of KSB. LS passed
                        away on 19 October 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     Kuek Hock Eng (“KHE”): The late son of KSB
                        and LS. He was originally the administrator of KSB’s estate and was
                        subsequently replaced by the Defendants upon the discovery that he was a
                        bankrupt. KHE passed away on 16 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     Ho Per Jong (“HPJ”): The wife of
                        KHE. She gave evidence for the Defendants, who are her children, in the
                        present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     Kuek Siew Chew: The daughter of KSB and LS. She is the Plaintiff in the
                        present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_f"></a>(f)     Kuek Siew Eng (“KSE”): The other daughter of KSB and LS. She
                        was a Plaintiff’s witness in the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_g"></a>(g)     Kuek Siang Wei: The son of KHE and HPJ.
                        He is the first defendant in the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_h"></a>(h)     Kuek Tsing Hsia: The daughter of KHE
                        and HPJ. She is the second defendant in the present
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For ease of reference, LS’ family will be
                    referred to as the first family while GAP’s family will be referred to as
                    the second family. While the matter was disputed, it appears that prior to
                    KSB’s demise on 30 January 2007, the first family did not know that KSB
                    had another family with GAP or that if they did, they did not know much about
                    the second family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On his death, KSB did not leave behind any will,
                    but the first family subsequently found in KSB’s safe a note dated 23 May
                    2002 purportedly written by him, setting out the division of his assets amongst
                    the members of the first family and the second family. However, the note could
                    not be recognised as a valid testamentary instrument under the law as KSB had
                    failed to affix his signature on it and it was not attested to by any
                    witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The unsigned note tendered as evidence was a
                    photocopy of the original handwritten note.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The
                    unsigned note was predominantly written in Chinese. While a certified
                    translation was not provided, an English version was set out in KSW’s
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The substance
                    of KSB’s wishes as set out in the unsigned note was not disputed by the
                    parties. For ease of reference, they are briefly set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     KSB’s house at Toh Tuck Road
                        (“the Toh Tuck Property”) was given to KSW and his brother,
                        Kuek Yong Wei (“KYW”). These are the grandsons of
                    KSB.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Two properties
                        located in Johor Bahru, Malaysia were given to KHE.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Jurong Kechil shophouse was given
                        to the second family.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     A sum of $1.65m was to be divided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       KHE (son of KSB):
                            $400,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       KSE (daughter of KSB): $200,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the Plaintiff (daughter of KSB):
                            $200,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       LS (wife of KSB): $200,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       HPJ (wife of KHE): $200,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       KTH (daughter of KHE):
                            $100,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       Kuek Tsing Qi (daughter of KHE): $100,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_viii"></a>(viii)       Kuek Tsing Xiu (daughter
                            of KHE): $100,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_ix"></a>(ix)       Kerk Hup Hin (brother of KSB):
                        $100,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_6-p2_d-p3_x"></a>(x)       Yak Hong Eng (wife of Kerk Hup Hin): $50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The balance of the cash and shares,
                        which was not particularised in the note, was given to KSW and KYW (the sons
                        of KHE and grandsons of KSB).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The significant points to be gleaned from the
                    unsigned note are set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The daughters of KSB, the Plaintiff
                        and KSE, were each given $200,000, with no share in the residuary
                        estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        deceased’s son, KHE, was to receive the two properties in Johor Bahru,
                        Malaysia, together with a sum of $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The grandsons of KSB, KSW and KYW, were to
                        receive the bulk of the estate, that is, the Toh Tuck Property and the
                        remaining cash and shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     While the unsigned note referred to the residuary estate,
                        it did not indicate the size of the balance of the cash and shares. As will
                        be seen later, the residuary estate is, in fact, very
                    substantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        second family’s share was limited to the Jurong Kechil shophouse. The
                        second family comprises GAP and her five children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Thereafter, KSB’s wife from the first
                    family, LS, executed a deed of consent dated 19 March 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This deed of consent
                    was signed (by application of LS’ thumb print), sealed, delivered and
                    witnessed by a commissioner for oaths. This deed sets out LS’ consent to
                    the wishes of KSB as reflected in the unsigned note and also to the appointment
                    of KHE as the administrator of the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The evidence was that in or around the same
                    time, a letter of consent (“the letter of consent”) was signed by
                    all 17 parties named in the note, including members of the second family,
                    signifying their agreement to abide by the wishes of KSB as set out in the
                        note.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The evidence as to when this letter of consent
                    was signed by the parties named in the note was disputed. Indeed, I note that
                    there was no attestation to the parties signing the letter of consent. Neither
                    was there a date to indicate when each party had signed the letter of consent.
                    The evidence, however, supports the view that the letter of consent was signed
                    shortly after 19 March 2007 when a family meeting was held at
                    KSB’s home on the 49th day of his death. That said, it also appears that
                    the Plaintiff did not sign it during the meeting at KSB’s home. Instead,
                    she and KSE signed the letter of consent later in the evening of that day. The
                    important point, however, is that it was undisputed that the Plaintiff and KSE
                    had signed the letter of consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While it is accepted that the unsigned note
                    was found in KSB’s safe at the Toh Tuck Property, it is acknowledged that
                    the date when the note was found was disputed. In this regard, the evidence of
                    the Plaintiff was difficult to follow. At one point in time, the Plaintiff
                    appeared to state that the note was only found some three or four months after
                    19 March 2007. This seemed rather unlikely. Indeed, Kerk Teck Sim, a cousin of
                    the Plaintiff who gave evidence on the opening of the safe, estimated that the
                    safe was opened by a locksmith engaged by him and in his presence some two
                    months after KSB’s death. It is notable that Kerk Teck Sim was not a
                    beneficiary under the unsigned note and he does not enjoy any rights under the
                    intestacy laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I also note that while the Plaintiff stated in
                    evidence that she could not confirm the handwriting in the unsigned note as
                    belonging to KSB, the evidence as a whole supports the conclusion that the
                    unsigned note was genuine. In fact, KSE agreed under cross-examination that the
                    unsigned note was written by her father, KSB.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thereafter, KHE applied for the grant of
                    letters of administration in respect of KSB’s estate in or around
                    September 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Notwithstanding his status as an
                    undischarged bankrupt, KHE was appointed to be the administrator of the estate
                    pursuant to an order-in-terms granted by the court. However, the order was not
                    extracted over the course of the next three years. Throughout this time, the law
                    firm, M/s P S Goh and Co, had conduct of the matter and was responsible for
                    preparing the aforesaid documents and KHE’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Subsequently in 2010, GAP from the second
                    family signified that she did not want to be bound by the unsigned note and
                    claimed to be entitled to a half share of KSB’s estate on the basis of the
                    intestacy regime. In this regard, she lodged a caveat against the estate in the
                    Subordinate Courts (as it then was) and filed an application on behalf of
                    herself and her daughter, Kuek Geok Hua (“KGH”), to be added as
                    joint administrators of KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     KHE and his wife, HPJ, then sought the
                    assistance of M/s Sankar Ow &amp; Partners LLP on 10 May 2010 with the intention
                    to resist GAP’s application. The solicitor in charge of the matter at M/s
                    Sankar Ow &amp; Partners LLP, Mr Chia Soo Michael (“Mr
                    Chia”), was of the view that the letter of consent was likely to be
                    upheld as a family arrangement. Mr Chia was said to have repeated this advice at
                    a subsequent meeting with four members of the first family on 13 May
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Notwithstanding this, Mr Chia later issued a
                    written advice to KHE dated 18 May 2010, informing him that there was a
                    possibility that the letter of consent might not be upheld by the
                        court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Mr
                    Chia also confirmed in the letter that the administratorship would likely be
                    replaced by two of KHE’s children, namely the Defendants in the current
                    proceedings, in the light of KHE’s bankruptcy. In this regard, Mr Chia
                    admitted during cross-examination that he did not send the letter to the other
                    members of the first family, in particular, the Plaintiff, LS and KSE, even
                    though he purported to be acting for the first family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The general tenor of Mr
                    Chia’s evidence was that he believed that it was sufficient to communicate
                    by letter, his words of caution regarding the validity of the letter of consent,
                    to KHE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In view of the possible invalidity of the
                    letter of consent, the beneficiaries named in the note belonging or related to
                    the first family subsequently executed a deed of consent dated 8 July 2010
                    (“the deed of consent”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This deed authorised the Defendants to,
                    amongst others, apply to be the administrators of KSB’s estate and to
                    enter into negotiations with the second family for an amicable resolution of the
                    dispute. At this juncture, the parties gave conflicting evidence of the
                    circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of consent and events
                    relating to KSB’s assets in Malaysia, more of which will be elaborated
                    below. Regardless of this, it was agreed that the Plaintiff, LS and KSE were not
                    apprised of the negotiations that took place between the Defendants and the
                    second family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The negotiations eventually culminated in the
                    execution of the deed of family arrangement (“the deed of family
                    arrangement”) dated 11 November 2010 between the first family and the
                    second family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In view of the deed of consent above, the first
                    family was represented by the Defendants whereas the representatives of the
                    second family were GAP and KGH. In this regard, the Plaintiff asserted that she
                    had not known of the presence of the deed of family arrangement up until 7 May
                    2012, when the named beneficiaries under the deed of family arrangement were
                    present at the office of M/s Sankar Ow &amp; Partners LLP to receive their
                    respective shares of KSB’s assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Under the deed of family arrangement between
                    the first family and the second family, the Plaintiff and KSE retained their
                    entitlements (by reference to the unsigned note) of $200,000 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     What was significant was that the aggregate
                    share of the second family was significantly increased. Leaving aside the family
                    home in Singapore, the shophouse in Singapore and the sum of $1.65m, which were
                    to be distributed in accordance with the unsigned note, all other assets,
                    including the shares and the Malaysian properties, were to be divided equally
                    between the first family and the second family on a 50:50 basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I note in passing that the drafting of the
                    residuary clause in the deed of family arrangement could have been clearer in
                    respect of the purported intention of the parties. On one interpretation, the
                    parties appear to mean that the residuary estate would be split 50:50 between
                        <em>all</em> the members of the first family and the
                    second family. On this basis, the Plaintiff and KSE, both members of the first
                    family, would be entitled to further sums over and above their respective shares
                    of $200,000 pursuant to the unsigned note. However, in response to a question
                    that I asked, Mr Chia explained that the reference to the splitting of all other
                    assets between the first family and the second family on a 50:50 basis was not
                    intended to mean that all members of the first family would enjoy a share. In so
                    far as the first family was concerned, the intention was for these other assets
                    (balance of the shares and cash) to be distributed as per the unsigned note
                        (<em>ie</em>, to KYW and KSW only).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     While the terms of the deed of family
                    arrangement could have been expressed in much clearer terms, the point remains
                    that the Plaintiff and KSE’s entitlements were to remain at $200,000 each.
                    This was their original entitlement under the unsigned note. Indeed, under
                    re-examination, KSE testified that she was not told that she might receive more
                    than $200,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Further, under cross
                    examination and re-examination, KSW agreed that there was no intention to give
                    more than $200,000 each to the Plaintiff and KSE.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the meantime, from late 2010 to 2011, HPJ
                    applied for the grant of letters of administration in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, on
                    the basis that she was a beneficiary of KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     While the Plaintiff and KSE agreed that they
                    had accompanied HPJ to Johor Bahru sometime in 2010 to sign documents at a
                    lawyer’s office, they gave evidence that they were not aware of the
                    contents of those documents. The documents were drafted in Malay and both the
                    Plaintiff and KSE were not given explanations, in either Mandarin or Hokkien, as
                    to the contents of those documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> That said, it is reasonably
                    clear that the Plaintiff and KSE must have been cognisant by 2010 that KSB had
                    two properties in Johor Bahru. Indeed, these two properties were also mentioned
                    in the unsigned note as being intended for KHE. Moreover, both the Plaintiff and
                    KSE agreed that the subsequent transfers of two immovable properties in Johor
                    Bahru to KHE were consistent with the unsigned note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Similar to the circumstances surrounding the
                    deed of family arrangement, it is the Plaintiff’s case that she did not,
                    however, know of KSB’s bank accounts in both Malaysia and Singapore until
                    much later. The Plaintiff also asserted that she only knew about the Malaysian
                    bank accounts after finding a small diary in LS’ room after the
                    latter’s demise in 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At the outset, there is an issue with the
                    validity of the letter of consent signed by both the members of the first family
                    and the second family in recognition of the unsigned note found in the safe
                    belonging to KSB. After dealing with the letter of consent, I will proceed to
                    address the issue of whether the deed of consent should be set aside. Finally,
                    the issues concerning the validity of the deed of family arrangement will be
                    discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The letter of consent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In determining whether the letter of consent
                    executed by the parties is valid, it is essential to construe the nature and
                    purport of the document. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that the
                    unsigned note purportedly written by KSB does not amount to a will under the
                    law. Under s 6 of the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Wills Act”), a will must be in writing and signed by the
                    testator at the foot or end thereof in the presence of two or more witnesses,
                    who shall subscribe to the will in the presence of the testator. In this regard,
                    the unsigned note, not having any form of attestation, is not a testamentary
                    instrument that can give rise to a proper and valid distribution of KSB’s
                    assets. Therefore, KSB died intestate and the distribution of his assets is
                    governed by the intestacy laws of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Leaving aside the issue concerning the
                    legitimacy of KSB’s marriage to GAP, the letter of consent essentially
                    amounts to a compromise of the respective entitlements of the beneficiaries
                    under the intestacy regime (see s 7 of the ISA). In this regard, the letter of
                    consent must be executed by way of a deed or a contract in order to give rise to
                    a valid compromise under the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The letter of consent is, however, not a valid
                    deed in so far as the document does not bear any intention of the parties to
                    execute it as a deed. In this regard, the common law provides that a deed must
                    be signed, sealed and delivered to be legally binding on the relevant
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the decision of <em>Hishiya
                        Seiko Co Ltd v Wah Nam Plastic Industry Pte Ltd and Another</em>
                    [1993] SGHC 7 (“<em>Hishiya</em>”), Punch
                    Coomaraswamy J dealt with the issue of a deed of guarantee that was not sealed
                    by the parties. The learned judge endorsed the English position, as illustrated
                    in the decisions of <em>Stromdale &amp; Ball Ld v
                        Burden</em> [1952] 1 Ch 223 and <em>First National
                        Securities Ltd v Jones and Another</em> [1978] 1 Ch 109
                        (“<em>First National Securities</em>”),
                    that a document with a signature duly attested to and which bore a wax or wafer
                    or other indication of a seal would give rise to a valid deed. In particular,
                    the English Court of Appeal in <em>First National
                        Securities</em> found that a circle with the letters
                    “L.S” amounted to a seal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In contrast, the letter of consent in this
                    case was only signed by the beneficiaries named in the note without more.
                    Specifically, there was no attestation or any indication of a seal which would
                    have given rise to a valid deed. I am therefore of the view that the letter of
                    consent cannot be upheld as a valid deed in the light of the non-compliance with
                    the requirements set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In my judgment, the letter of consent cannot
                    be upheld as a valid and binding contract due to the lack of consideration.
                    Under the general principles governing the law of contract, a valid contract is
                    founded upon the elements of offer and acceptance, consideration, and
                    parties’ intention to create legal relations. While the consideration must
                    be sufficient in the sense that it is legally recognised as possessing value in
                    the eyes of the law, it is of course not necessary to establish the adequacy of
                    the consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is well settled that a settlement or
                    forbearance to sue on a claim (especially when it appears that there is a
                    reasonable basis for the claim) can amount to sufficient consideration so as to
                    support a contract. That said, problems can still arise when the claim is
                    doubtful and where it is unclear as to whether the promisee had reasonable
                    grounds for his belief in the claim. This aside, in appropriate cases, a
                    forbearance to sue may amount to valid consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The question as to whether a purported deed
                    can be construed and validated as a contract was considered by Coomaraswamy J in
                        <em>Hishiya</em>. In that case, consideration in the
                    form of a forbearance to sue was found to be present and the plaintiff’s
                    debt claim against the defendant on the basis of the guarantee was therefore
                    allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Leaving aside the value of the forbearance to
                    sue, a much trickier question is whether love, affection or moral obligations
                    can be regarded as sufficient consideration in and of themselves. The general
                    rule, of course, is that these are insufficient, as a matter of law, to support
                    a contract. Indeed, it has been said that where the promisee’s act flows
                    from an existing moral obligation, the court is very unlikely to recognise the
                    act as being sufficient consideration. Obvious policy considerations loom
                    large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For instance, in <em>White v
                        Bluett</em> (1853) 23 LJ Ex 36 (“<em>White</em>”), a father agreed to release his son from a debt
                    if the son would stop complaining about the manner in which he had distributed
                    his assets. The promise was held not to bind the father since the son’s
                    offer to cease complaining was something he was morally obliged to do. The
                    father was entitled to distribute his assets as he wished. Prof Lee Pey Woan, in
                        <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang
                    Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The
                        Law of Contract in Singapore</em>”) at para 04.03, suggests
                    that the position may be different if the promisor in <em>White</em> had received a practical or factual benefit from the
                    promise. If so, the court might be able to find consideration on the back of the
                    English Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Williams v Roffey
                        Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</em> [1991] 1 QB 1
                        (“<em>Williams</em>”). In that case, the
                    court upheld a promise by A to pay additional money to B to complete work
                    already agreed to be performed by B in circumstances where B’s slow
                    performance exposed A to liability under another contract. Even though B was
                    subject to an existing obligation to do the work, A was said to have received a
                    practical benefit from the completed work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is not necessary, however, to consider in
                    detail the <em>Williams</em> decision or the subsequent
                    local cases that have touched on that decision. Leaving aside the thorny issue
                    of whether there was any real practical benefit received by the parties from the
                    letter of consent, it is apparent that the matter at hand falls to be governed
                    by the law that has developed in respect of family arrangements. This will be
                    considered below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Leaving aside for the moment the law applying
                    to family arrangements, it follows that in the absence of a valid deed, the
                    alternative construction of the letter of consent as constituting a contract
                    under general contract law fails. This is due to a lack of consideration moving
                    from the parties who would not otherwise have any entitlement under the
                    intestacy regime, such as the Defendants who are the grandchildren of
                    KSB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In elaboration of the entitlement of each
                    member of the first family under the intestacy regime, r 2 read with r 3 of s 7
                    of the ISA provide that LS would be entitled to a half-share of KSB’s
                    estate and the three children, namely, KHE, KSE and the Plaintiff, would each
                    take a one-sixth share of the estate. The grandchildren would not otherwise be
                    entitled to any share of the estate but for the unsigned note purportedly
                    written by KSB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I note in passing that the point may also be
                    raised that if KSB’s marriage with GAP were recognised at law, this would
                    directly affect the entitlements of both the first family and the second family
                    under the intestacy laws. Nevertheless, I am not making any finding in relation
                    to this matter given the state of the evidence before me. The legal status of
                    GAP as a wife under customary law has not been determined by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In reiteration of my finding above, the letter
                    of consent, in so far as it provides for the entitlements of, amongst others,
                    the grandchildren of KSB, amounts to <em>gifts</em> by the
                    beneficiaries under the intestacy laws. In this regard, these gifts would
                    otherwise be invalid unless executed by way of a valid deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Nevertheless, it was argued that the letter of
                    consent was a valid family arrangement binding on the relevant parties,
                    including the Plaintiff in this instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     At this juncture, it is apposite to refer to
                    the decision of the learned V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <em>Sheares Betty Hang Kiu v Chow Kwok Chi</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R)
                    285 (“<em>Sheares Betty</em>”), which
                    considered the issue of validity of a deed of family arrangement at length. In
                    considering the legal significance of a family arrangement, Rajah J at [16]
                    referred to the <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em>
                    vol 18 (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1997) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>301.</b> …
                        <em>A family arrangement is an agreement between members of
                            the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit
                            of the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by
                            preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family
                            by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more
                        usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term
                        “family arrangement” is applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>304.</b> … Matters which would be fatal
                        to the validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections
                        to the binding effect of family arrangements. Conversely, an intention to
                        create a legally enforceable contract may be negatived more readily where
                        the parties to an arrangement are members of the same family than where they
                        are not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>312.</b> …
                        <em>Since the consideration for a family arrangement is
                            partly value and partly love and affection, the pecuniary worth of the
                            consideration is not regarded too closely. The court will not, as a
                            general rule, inquire into the adequacy of the consideration</em>,
                        but there is an equity to set aside a family arrangement where the
                        inadequacy of the consideration is so gross as to lead to the conclusion
                        that the party either did not understand what he was about, or was the
                        victim of some imposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_1"></a>In elaboration of the above, Rajah J opined at [17]
                    that the classic hallmarks of a family arrangement are “a pre-existing
                    family dispute, a clearly declared intention to resolve outstanding matters and
                    a series of arrangements to address outstanding matters”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In this case, the letter of consent was signed
                    after the demise of KSB in or around March 2007. The relevant parties had
                    gathered at KSB’s last residence, the Toh Tuck Property, to sign the
                    letter of consent. By this time, KHE, HPJ and three of their children had
                    already moved into the Toh Tuck Property. In fact, it was said that they had
                    moved in right after KSB’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In applying the legal principles above, even
                    if the letter of consent was signed for the purpose of resolving a family
                    dispute upon the demise of KSB in 2007, I am of the view that it does not stand
                    the scrutiny of the law so as to constitute a valid family arrangement for the
                    following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, the arrangement under the letter of
                    consent gives rise to gross inadequacy of consideration as compared to the
                    distribution under the intestacy laws such that it ought to be set aside. This
                    is notwithstanding that the law on family arrangements does not usually regard
                    adequacy of consideration as an issue given that such an arrangement is founded
                    partly on value and partly on sentiment rather than pure commercial
                    considerations. Notably, in <em>Pek Nam Kee and another v Peh Lam
                        Kong and another</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 750 (“<em>Pek Nam Kee</em>”) at [108], it was stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If, however, the inadequacy of the consideration is so gross as
                        to lead the court to the conclusion that a party to the arrangement either
                        did not understand what he was doing or was the victim of some imposition,
                        the court can set aside the arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Whether or not the gross inadequacy of
                    consideration is to be treated as invalid consideration or simply as evidence
                    from which the court may be able to infer (together with the facts as a whole) a
                    vitiating factor such as <em>non est factum</em>,
                    misrepresentation or non-disclosure, the result is that the family arrangement
                    is not enforceable. In this case, the gross inadequacy in consideration stems
                    from a comparison of the entitlements of LS, KSE and the Plaintiff under the
                    intestacy laws as opposed to that provided in the unsigned note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In this regard, the total value of KSB’s
                    estate is approximately $13.8m. This is apparent from a letter dated 23 June
                    2010 from Mr Chia, solicitor for the first family, to Mr Dennis Singham
                    (“Mr Singham”), solicitor for the second family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The entitlements of the three aforesaid
                    parties under the intestacy laws, regardless of whether the second family is
                    taken into consideration in the mathematical exercise, would come up to more
                    than four times of that under the unsigned note, which provided pecuniary
                    legacies of $200,000 each (see [90] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Second, one of the considerations in
                    determining the validity of a family arrangement is the state of knowledge of
                    the parties concerned. In <em>Pek Nam Kee</em>, the learned
                    Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) opined at [109] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also not fatal to a family arrangement that a party to it is
                        ignorant of the true state of his rights or is ignorant of the true nature
                        of the arrangement <em>as long as the transaction has been
                            effected in good faith and the ignorant party has not been misled by any
                            one else</em> and, in fact, has an intention which is not widely
                        different from that expressed by the arrangement. It is also not essential
                        to a family arrangement that the parties to it receive independent legal
                        advice, though of course this is desirable in the interests of deflecting
                        later challenges to the arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2_2"></a>In this regard, Prakash JC emphasised at [110] of
                        <em>Pek Nam Kee</em> that a fundamental consideration
                    is first and foremost “whether [the family arrangement] was founded in an
                    honest disclosure of material facts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In considering the totality of circumstances
                    in this case, I am of the opinion that the disparity in knowledge of the parties
                    concerned, namely KHE and HPJ on the one hand, and LS, KSE and the Plaintiff on
                    the other, is such that the letter of consent as a purported family arrangement
                    ought to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In essence, LS, KSE and the Plaintiff executed
                    the letter of consent without knowing the material fact of the value of
                    KSB’s estate. In this connection, they were also not apprised of, amongst
                    other things, the value of the Singapore bank accounts that KSB had and the
                    physical state of the immovable properties in Malaysia. These are facts which
                    the aforesaid parties would have been entitled to know in view of their rights
                    under the intestacy laws. However, they were kept in the dark and even
                    misinformed in the process of the management of the immovable properties in
                    Malaysia. This will be discussed in greater detail in the next section
                    concerning the validity of the deed of consent signed on 8 July
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For the reasons above, I am of the judgment
                    that the letter of consent entered into by the parties does not have any binding
                    legal effect as a family arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The deed of consent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Plaintiff has relied on four main
                    arguments to support her case for the deed of consent dated 8 July 2010 to be
                    invalidated or set aside. They can be broadly classified into the following
                    categories: defence of <em>non est factum</em>, lack of
                    independent legal advice, undue influence and material non-disclosure. I will
                    deal with each of these arguments in turn. Applying the principles set out
                    above, the deed of consent dated 8 July 2010 was signed and sealed, and embodied
                    a family arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence of non est factum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Plaintiff has alluded to the fact that the
                    deed of consent was not properly explained to her and that she had been rushed
                    into signing it. On the other hand, the Defendants argued that both the
                    Plaintiff and KSE should be bound by the deed of consent as they were well aware
                    of what they were agreeing to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In this regard, the defence of <em>non est factum</em> in the context of deeds has been
                    explained succinctly in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> vol 32 (Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2012) at para 236,
                    reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before a party executes a deed, it should be read by him, or correctly
                        read over or fully and accurately explained to him, and he cannot be
                        required to execute it until this has been done. If he is content to execute
                        it without informing himself of its contents, it will be in general be
                        binding on him, even though its contents are materially different from what
                        he supposed, and even though he is himself illiterate or blind. However, if
                        the party executing the deed acts with reasonable care and yet is mistaken
                        or misled (in particular, if he is illiterate or blind and it is falsely
                        read over or falsely explained to him), and in consequence there is a
                            <em>radical or fundamental distinction between what is it
                            and what he believed it to be</em>, not attributable to a mistake
                        of law as to its effect, the plea of non est factum will be available and
                        the deed will be void. Even though all the requirements for avoiding the
                        deed on this ground may not be fulfilled, a misled executing party may be
                        able to treat the deed as voidable under the law relating to <em>misrepresentation</em>, or it may be void as executed
                        under a <em>mutual mistake of fact</em>.</p>

                    following passage of Lord Pearson’s judgment in <em>Saunders v Anglia Building Society</em> [1971] AC 1004 at
                    1034:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, the plea of non est factum ought to be available in a

                        reasons (not limited to blindness or illiteracy) is not capable of both
                        reading and sufficiently understanding the deed or other document to be
                        signed. By ‘sufficiently understanding’ I mean understanding at
                        least to the point of <em>detecting a fundamental difference
                            between the actual document and the document as the signer had believed

                        would not be a proper case if (a) the signature of the document was brought
                        about by negligence of the signer in failing to take precautions which he
                        ought to have taken, or (b) <em>the actual document was not

                    cross-examination by Dr Raman, the Plaintiff demonstrated that she had knowledge
                    of the nature and purpose of the deed of consent prior to signing it. With
                    regard to the effect of the deed of consent in confirming the earlier letter of

                    over the exact date on which the letter of consent was signed, the Plaintiff
                    clearly knew the effect of the deed of consent in upholding the earlier letter
                    of consent. With regard to the other main purpose of entering into the deed of
                    consent, the Plaintiff gave the following evidence in
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5_5"></a>In the light of the above, I cannot accept the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6_6"></a>KSE also recognised that the deed of consent
                    was for the purpose of appointing the two defendants as the administrators to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Considering the evidence as a whole, both the
                    Plaintiff and KSE appeared to have understood the two main purposes behind
                    entering into the deed of consent: to confirm that the distribution would be in
                    accordance to the unsigned note as per the earlier letter of consent and to
                    appoint the defendants as administrators in place of KHE. On that basis, it
                    cannot be said that the deed of consent was fundamentally different from the
                    document the Plaintiff and KSE had believed it to be. The Plaintiff’s
                    defence of <em>non est factum</em> is therefore rejected in
                    its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of independent legal advice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Apart from the argument that she did not
                    understand the contents of the deed of consent, the Plaintiff also submitted
                    that she was not offered the opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior
                    to signing the deed of consent. In response, the Defendant argued that as a
                    general rule, the mere lack of independent legal advice should not invalidate a
                    transaction in the absence of some vitiating factor, such as <em>non est factum</em>, unconscionability, fraud, misrepresentation or
                    undue influence. It was further submitted that the Plaintiff clearly knew the
                    contents of the deed of consent and had signed it voluntarily. The Defendants
                    also argued that in any event, the Plaintiff had waived her right to seek
                    independent legal advice with reference to cl 5 of the deed of consent, which is
                    reproduced as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the Parties acknowledge that they have had the opportunity to have
                        this Deed reviewed by an legal advisor or counsel of their own choosing, and
                        if they have opted not to have this Deed reviewed by an independent legal
                        advisor or counsel prior to their signing this Deed, the Parties hereto
                        acknowledge that this is a knowing and conscious waiver of any rights that
                        the Parties may have to legal advisor or counsel in reviewing this
                        Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     At the outset, I accept the Defendants’
                    argument that the mere lack of independent legal advice should not, in and of
                    itself, be a vitiating factor to invalidate the deed of consent. In this regard,
                    while the lack of independent legal advice may be a relevant fact that the court
                    can take into account in determining whether to set aside a transaction, the
                    party seeking to set aside a transaction has to establish some other factor,
                    such as an inequality of bargaining power, misrepresentation, undue influence or
                    unconscionability. It has been highlighted in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> vol 91 (Butterworths, 5th Ed,
                    2012) at para 924 that it is not essential to the validity of a family
                    arrangement that the various parties should have separate legal advice. In this
                    respect, it was acknowledged that any party might have been properly advised by
                    the family solicitor, which in the present case, was Mr Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Returning to the facts of the present case, I
                    am satisfied that the lack of independent legal advice is not a sufficient basis
                    to justify setting aside the deed of consent for the following reasons. First,
                    as discussed in the previous section, the Plaintiff clearly knew the content and
                    purpose of the deed of consent prior to signing it. Second, in considering the
                    evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the Plaintiff and KSE were given
                    ample opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the deed of
                    consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was undisputed that both Mr Chia and Mr
                    Joseph Hoo (“Mr Hoo”) were present at the time when the parties
                    signed the deed of consent. In this respect, the evidence before me suggests
                    that cl 5 of the deed of consent was adequately explained to the parties and
                    that the parties were informed of their right to have the deed of consent
                    reviewed by an independent legal counsel. Having elected to turn down the offer
                    to seek independent legal advice, the Plaintiff cannot now attempt to set aside
                    the deed of consent on the basis of a lack of independent legal
                advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Third, it is noted that Mr Chia’s
                    evidence that he had given the parties <em>two</em>
                    opportunities to have the deed of consent reviewed by an independent legal
                    counsel remained unrebutted even under heavy cross-examination by Mr
                        Tng:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... Did you give the plaintiff an opportunity to
                            take legal advice on this document?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In the course of the morning, when wa---I was
                            explaining the contents of the deed, before the administrator’s
                            names were filled in, when wa---I was explaining the clause about them
                            being given, er, independent legal advice. Having the right to seek
                            independent legal advice, I actually asked if they wanted to take the
                            document elsewhere, and nobody said that they wanted to.</span></p>

                            opinion. Why didn’t you allow her?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I---I just told you she didn’t ask me this
                            question.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">All right. She didn’t ask you.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In fact, when we came back from lunch, when Mr
                            Joseph Hoo came to witness two things, the deed of consent and also the
                            renunciation so that the new administrators could be appointed, I had to
                            read the document all over again to the parties in a lan---language that
                            they understood, before Mr Joseph Hoo would witness them. So that was a
                            second time in which I would have explained the clause about independent
                            legal advice and, no, I mean, if---if a question like that was asked of
                            me in front of another solicitor, there---there’s no way I’m
                            going to refuse, er, such a request, and expect the other solicitor to
                            witness the document, that---that’s---that would be quite
                            absurd.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Mr Chia subsequently confirmed that Mr Hoo was
                    present throughout the meeting in the afternoon of 8 July 2010. Mr Hoo is an
                    advocate and solicitor and a commissioner for oaths. I therefore accept that Mr
                    Hoo was, in all likelihood, present when Mr Chia explained and translated the
                    contents of the deed of consent to the parties. In the circumstances, it would
                    be highly unlikely that Mr Hoo would have stood by idly without intervening if
                    Mr Chia, as the Plaintiff has alleged, turned down her request for the deed of
                    consent to be examined by an independent legal counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I therefore find myself unable to accept the
                    Plaintiff’s allegation that she was not afforded the opportunity to seek
                    independent legal advice on the day the deed of consent was signed. Given that
                    the Plaintiff had turned down the opportunity to have the deed of consent
                    reviewed by an independent legal counsel, she cannot now attempt to set aside
                    the deed of consent on the sole basis that it was signed without the benefit of
                    independent legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I also note in passing that while the
                    Plaintiff, in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, denied being given a copy of
                    the deed of consent, she accepted under cross-examination that she was indeed
                    given a copy of the deed of consent at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Material non-disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The threshold question which has to be
                    considered in addressing the issue of non-disclosure would be whether the deed
                    of consent amounted to a family arrangement. As referred to at [44] above, Rajah
                    J observed in <em>Sheares Betty</em> that the classic
                    hallmarks of a family arrangement are “a pre-existing family dispute, a
                    clearly declared intention to resolve outstanding matters and a series of
                    arrangements to address outstanding matters”. On the facts of the present
                    case, I have no hesitation in finding that the deed of consent dated 8 July
                    2010 was a family arrangement intended to resolve a pre-existing family
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Given that the deed of consent amounts to a
                    family arrangement, considerations such as whether there was honest disclosure
                    of material facts or undue influence will be crucial in ascertaining the
                    validity of the deed of consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Pek Nam Kee</em>,
                    Prakash JC made the following observations (at [107]) on family arrangements in
                    general:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court faced with the issue whether a particular family arrangement
                        should be upheld or set aside has to be aware that family arrangements are
                            <em>very special creatures which have to be treated
                            rather differently from the commercial transactions with which it is
                            more often concerned</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As referred to at [51] above, Prakash JC made
                    a few observations in <em>Pek Nam Kee</em> (at
                    [109]–[110]) on the principles governing the validity of such family
                    arrangements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">109    It is also not
                            fatal to a family arrangement that a party to it is ignorant of the true
                            state of his rights or is ignorant of the true nature of the arrangement
                            as long as the transaction has been effected in good faith and the
                            ignorant party has not been misled by any one else and, in fact, has an
                            intention which is not widely different from that expressed by the
                            arrangement. It is also not essential to a family arrangement that the
                            parties to it receive independent legal advice, though of course this is
                            desirable in the interests of deflecting later challenges to the
                            arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110    What is most
                            important in considering the validity of such an arrangement is first
                            whether it was founded in an honest disclosure of material facts and,
                            secondly, whether any undue influence was brought to bear on any party
                            to the arrangement. In this context, para 315 of <em>Halsbury's</em> is worth quoting in full. It
                            states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>Duty of disclosure</b>. In any family
                            arrangement there must be honest disclosure by each party to the other
                            of all such material facts known to him, relative to the rights and
                            title of either, as are calculated to influence the other's judgment in
                            the adoption of the arrangement, and an advantage taken by either of the
                            parties of the other's known ignorance of such facts will render the
                            agreement liable to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If one party to the arrangement has material information in his
                            possession which, without any dishonest intention, he does not
                            communicate to the others, proceedings by them to set aside the
                            transaction may succeed even though they made enquiries on the
                            subject.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     On the facts of that case, it was held that an
                    administrator of an estate had a duty to draw up full and complete accounts of
                    the estate. In the accounts, the administrator would have to show, to the best
                    of his ability, the amounts which a legatee had received from the estate and the
                    amounts which the legatee had paid on the estate’s behalf. Prakash JC
                    found that the administrator had presented accounts which left out the expenses
                    paid by the legatee but went further to emphasise to all parties the amount
                    which the legatee had supposedly taken for the legatee’s own benefit as
                    background to the drawing up of a deed of family arrangement. It was further
                    held that this amounted to material non-disclosures in the context of the
                    administrator’s proposal that the family arrangement be accepted, so as to
                    justify setting aside the deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Returning to the facts of the present action,
                    I am of the judgment that the Plaintiff has established a case of material
                    non-disclosure so as to justify setting aside the deed of consent. After
                    considering the evidence placed before me, I find, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that the Plaintiff, KSE and presumably LS, were largely kept in
                    the dark with regard to the following material facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     the value of KSB’s estate and
                        their respective entitlements under the ISA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     the likelihood or possibility that the
                        letter of consent would not be upheld by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Even if the view was taken that there was no
                    need to expressly warn the Plaintiff and KSE that the letter of consent might
                    well be invalid at law, I note that the non-disclosure of the size of
                    KSB’s estate is in itself a very significant factor given what the
                    Plaintiff would be entitled to receive under the intestacy laws. In fact, the
                    evidence suggests that this pattern of non-disclosure went on for an extended
                    period of time, all the way up to the time when the Defendants (and/or their
                    solicitors) were negotiating with the second family for a settlement of the
                    outstanding dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Even if KHE and HPJ were convenient points of
                    contact for Mr Chia in respect of the first family, the fact remains that the
                    Plaintiff, LS and KSE were not informed of the full facts. Nevertheless, for the
                    purposes of ascertaining the validity of the deed of consent, I acknowledge that
                    the primary consideration would be the Plaintiff’s knowledge at the time
                    the deed of consent was signed. In this regard, it was undisputed that the
                    unsigned note only referred to the following specific properties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     28 Toh Tuck Road (<em>ie</em>, the Toh Tuck Property);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     88 Jalan Jurong Kechil; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     the two properties located in Johor
                        Bahru, Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While there was a residuary clause in favour
                    of KYW and KSW, there was no mention of any other specific assets which had
                    belonged to KSB, such as his bank accounts or shares. To be clear, all that was
                    stated was that the balance of cash and shares were to be given to KYW and KSW.
                    There was no indication at all as to what was the value of KSB’s cash and
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am of
                    the view that the Plaintiff and KSE only knew about the full and complete
                    accounts of KSB’s estate in 2012 when Mr Tng was instructed by the
                    Plaintiff. During the cross-examination by Dr Raman, it was revealed that the
                    Plaintiff was very much kept in the dark with regard to the rest of KSB’s
                    assets which were <em>not</em> specifically listed in the
                        note:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7_7"></a>Nevertheless, the evidence as to when the
                    Plaintiff discovered the existence of the Malaysian properties was a little
                    confusing. At one point during the trial, the Plaintiff appeared to state that
                    she did not know about the Malaysian properties prior to KSB’s death and
                    that she had only found out about the Malaysian properties sometime in 2012 from
                    a small diary belonging to LS which had set out the address of the properties
                    and the bank account numbers. I am, however, of the view that the Plaintiff must
                    have known of the existence of the Malaysian properties when the unsigned note
                    was read. Indeed, the Plaintiff accepted that this was so when questioned
                    further. That said, I accept that she was not aware of the existence of the
                    Malaysian bank accounts until the discovery of LS’ diary.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11_11"></a>In this respect, while I am prepared to
                    accept that the representatives of the first family (<em>ie</em>, the Defendants) and the representatives of the second family

                    that is, unfortunately, not the issue at hand. The question I am concerned with
                    is whether the Plaintiff, KSE and LS were kept in the dark with regard to the
                    assets in KSB’s estate. After considering the evidence as a whole, I find

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13_13"></a>It is noted that the above conversation had
                    taken place at Mr Chia’s office. In the circumstances, I do not find Mr
                    Chia’s explanation that he did not have the figures with him at that point
                    in time particularly convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In my judgment, at the juncture when the deed
                    of consent was signed by the members of the first family, KHE and HPJ would, in
                    all likelihood, be acquainted with the assets in KSB’s estate. They were
                    the ones conversing with Mr Chia throughout that time. In fact, Mr Chia had, on
                    23 June 2010, sent a letter to Mr Singham, the solicitor representing the second
                    family, setting out a detailed list of assets in KSB’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The
                    estimated value of the bank balances in Singapore and the stocks held by KSB
                    were individually listed. In this regard, the only persons who could have
                    supplied Mr Chia with such information would be KHE and HPJ. This was confirmed
                    by HPJ during cross-examination, when she acknowledged that she had helped to
                    look for the relevant letters and documents, which were then passed to Goh Peck
                    San, the solicitor acting on behalf of the estate then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It is also clear from the evidence that KHE,
                    HPJ and their children moved into the Toh Tuck Property shortly after
                    KSB’s death. The unsigned note was found in KSB’s safe at the Toh
                    Tuck Property. While the unsigned note was read aloud at the time when it was
                    found, it is unclear what other documents (if any) were inside the safe. KHE and
                    his family lived in KSB’s house (<em>ie</em>, the Toh
                    Tuck Property) with LS until her demise in October 2012. The Plaintiff and her
                    sister, KSE, continued to reside at their own home in Clementi. The Plaintiff
                    and KSE worked as coffee shop assistants at Binjai Park. The evidence
                    established that KHE was already ill with severe kidney problems at that time.
                    KHE clearly had severe financial problems. Indeed, he had been made a bankrupt.
                    LS was illiterate and unwell. She needed to use a wheelchair. It is apparent
                    from the evidence that KHE and HPJ took the lead role in handling matters
                    relating to KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I also note in passing that the evidence as to
                    HPJ’s application for grant of letters of administration in Johor Bahru in
                    2010 supports my observation that KHE and HPJ were very much driving the
                    administration of KSB’s estate. Indeed, during cross-examination, HPJ
                    stated that she had asked KHE whether it was all right to proceed to make the
                    application and she received the response to go ahead because of his illness and
                    medical expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> In re-examination, HPJ
                    stressed that KHE’s medical expenses were considerable and that after she
                    had sold the Malaysian properties, the monies were spent on KHE’s medical
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This was so even
                    though HPJ agreed that the sale monies belonged to KSB’s estate and would
                    have to be repaid together with the monies in the Malaysian bank
                        accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> It appears that these
                    monies were also spent on KHE’s medical bills.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     While the questions concerning the legality of
                    HPJ’s actions in obtaining letters of administration in Malaysia and the
                    sale of the Johor Bahru properties are not directly before me, I reiterate that
                    the evidence supports the view that KHE and HPJ were the prime movers in the
                    administration of KSB’s estate right from an early stage. In all
                    likelihood, they were aware that KSB’s estate was very much larger than
                    what was specifically listed in the unsigned note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It bears emphasising that in any family
                    arrangement, there must be honest disclosure by each party to the other of
                        <em>all</em> such material facts known to him, relative
                    to the rights and title of either, as are calculated to influence the other's
                    judgment in the adoption of the arrangement. An advantage taken by either of the
                    parties of the other's known ignorance of such facts will render the agreement
                    liable to be set aside. Dishonest intention is not required for the agreement to
                    be set aside in so far as there has been material non-disclosure by one or more
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On the facts of the present case, the fatal
                    error committed by the parties was the adoption of the mindset that there was
                    simply no need to inform the Plaintiff, KSE and LS about the full extent of the
                    assets in KSB’s estate on the basis that they were only entitled to a sum
                    of $200,000 each under the unsigned note. It must be emphasised that the
                    unsigned note has <em>prima facie</em> absolutely <em>no</em> legal effect whatsoever. As discussed above, it does
                    not fulfil the requirements set out in the Wills Act for it to be considered a
                    testamentary instrument that is binding at law. Therefore, it can only be given
                    effect if <em>all</em> potential beneficiaries under the
                    intestacy regime give their <em>consent</em> to distribute
                    the assets in accordance with the note. In so doing, they would effectively be
                    compromising any entitlement that they had under the ISA. Under such a
                    circumstance, the full extent of KSB’s estate would surely be a material
                    fact which must be disclosed to <em>all</em> parties prior
                    to the adoption of the arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     For the avoidance of doubt, I agree with
                    Prakash JC’s observations in <em>Pek Nam Kee</em>
                    that a party’s ignorance of the true state of his rights or ignorance of
                    the true nature of the arrangement does not necessarily result in the
                    arrangement being set aside. The arrangement will be upheld in so far as the
                    transaction has been effected in good faith and the ignorant party has not been
                    misled by anyone else. Regrettably, that was not what happened in the present
                    case. As already explained above, it is apparent that at the point in time when
                    the members of the first family were entering into the deed of consent, KHE and
                    HPJ already knew about the full extent of KSB’s estate. This was not
                    communicated to the Plaintiff, KSE and LS. On that ground alone, I am of the
                    judgment that this amounts to a material non-disclosure which would justify
                    setting aside the deed of consent in its entirety. In arriving at this
                    conclusion, I also found it useful to refer to a few English authorities setting
                    out the scope of the requirement for disclosure of all material facts in the
                    context of a family arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In <em>Cocking v
                        Pratt</em> (1749-50) 1 Ves Sen 400, the deceased had passed away
                    intestate, leaving a widow and a daughter, who was then a minor. Four months
                    after the daughter’s coming of age, she had entered into an agreement with
                    her mother concerning the distribution of the deceased’s estate. The
                    agreement was subsequently ratified by the daughter’s husband, who
                    commenced an action as administrator of the daughter’s estate after her
                    death to set aside the agreement. In allowing the husband’s application to
                    set aside the agreement, Sir John Strange MR made the following observations at
                    401:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The mother plainly knew more than the
                            daughter</em>; and only says in general, she believes she
                        concealed nothing from her. Whether there has been <em>suppressio veri</em> is not clear upon the evidence. But there is
                        another foundation to interpose, <em>viz</em>. that it
                        appeared afterward that <em>the personal estate amounted to
                            more</em>; and the party suffering will be permitted to come here
                        to avail himself of that want of knowledge; not indeed in the case of a
                        trifle; but some bounds must be set to it. The daughter would be entitled to
                        5 or £600 more; which is very material in such a sum as this, and a
                        ground for the court to set it right: the daughter did not act on a
                        composition, as wanting to marry, and to have ready money: but took this as
                        her full share; and if it appears not so, the court cannot suffer the
                        agreement to stand. As to the ratification and release by the husband; he
                        was <em>as much in the dark</em>: this estate therefore
                        should be divided as the law directs, and the agreement set aside.</p>

                    significant. Assuming the total value of KSB’s estate amounted to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15_15"></a>As can be seen from the figures above, it
                    is undisputed that the difference is indeed stark. It is further noted that
                    KHE’s family, including HPJ, the Defendants and their other siblings would
                    stand to gain the most in the event that the note was upheld. In the
                    circumstances, given that both KHE and HPJ already knew about the full extent of
                    KSB’s estate at the time when the deed of consent was entered into, they
                    should have, at the very least, provided the rest of the first family with the
                    information concerning the assets in KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In the other decision of <em>Groves v Perkins</em> (1834) 6 Sim 576, a wife, who was deserted by
                    her husband, became entitled to a share of an intestate’s property
                    amounting to £3,609. The husband, while he was ignorant of the amount of
                    the share, assigned it in trust for his wife and children, subject to the
                    payment of 10s a week to himself for his life. Although the deed contained a
                    recital stating that the intestate’s estate was very considerable, the
                    administrators, who were the wife’s brothers and parties to the
                    transaction, failed to disclose to the husband the amount of the wife’s
                    share. In setting aside the deed in its entirety, Sir L Shadwell VC made the
                    following observations at 712–713:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The consideration, however, for which the Plaintiff executed the deed,
                        is very small; and the question is <em>whether, adverting to
                            the nature of the transaction, there was that disclosure made to the
                            Plaintiff which he was entitled to have</em>. The administrators
                        do not allege, in their answer, that they stated to the Plaintiff <em>what was the amount of the intestate’s property or of his
                            wife’s share of it</em>; nor is there any evidence to that
                        effect. The deed, it is true, recites that Mrs. Porteus was, at her death,
                        possessed of very considerable personal estate; but <em>I do
                            not think that that was a sufficient disclosure</em>. <em>And though there was not that fraud in the transaction which
                            the Plaintiff has charged, yet, as the administrators withheld from him
                            the knowledge of the amount of his wife’s share, there was that
                            non-disclosure of a material fact which compels me to say that the deed
                            cannot stand</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16_16"></a>In my judgment, the fact that KHE, being
                    the administrator on record at the time when the deed of consent was entered
                    into, had failed to disclose the assets in KSB’s estate to the Plaintiff,
                    KSE and LS effectively renders the deed of consent liable to be set
                    aside.</p>

                    non-disclosure concerning the assets in KSB’s estate, I note again that Mr
                    Chia had, on 18 May 2010, sent a letter to KHE, where he had cautioned that
                    there was a possibility the earlier letter of consent would not withstand the
                    scrutiny of the court if it were challenged:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>

                        considered a valid deed of family arrangement that could override the

<em>Well, to be blunt, actually,
                                there was already an agreement of how the negotiation and the
                                settlement was to proceed</em>. Under the note, your client
                            was entitled to $200,000, under the note, and that was all she was
                            entitled to, under the note. ... Whilst the intended administrators will
                            assume the role of Kuek Hock Eng for the negotiations, whatever they do,
                            whatever settlement they reach, <em>they can just not

                                beneficiaries in the note</em>. So the whole exercise was to
                            tell them, “Look, someone else is throwing in a spanner? Can you
                            all confirm you are not going to throw a spanner?” They confirm
                            they’re not going to throw a spanner. We said, “Look, thank
                            you for honouring the note. On our part, what we’ll do is
                            we’ll make sure that whatever we do, we will not touch your 1.65
                            million---your share of the 1.65 million.” So, that is the very
                            basic premise before we moved on to anything else. <em>So, actually, what Goh Ah Pi side of the family get, to be blunt,

                                encroach into the 1.65 million</em>; which was the very reason
                            why when Dennis Singham’s letter of the 29th of June 2010 came
                            and, er, they basically wanted a global half-half. We said,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20_20"></a>While it is acknowledged that most of the
                    events described above occurred <em>after</em> the deed of

                    mindset of Mr Chia, which was very similar to that of KHE and HPJ, as described
                    above. In essence, their starting position was that the Plaintiff, KSE and LS
                    were only entitled to $200,000 each under the unsigned note. To this end, in so
                    far as their shares were not affected in any way, there was no need to keep them
                    informed about either the breakdown of the assets in KSB’s estate, or any
                    developments that had taken place in the course of the administration, including
                    the ongoing negotiations with the second family. As explained above, this
                    approach is wholly misconceived. At the very least, the relevant parties,
                    especially KHE, who was the administrator on record, and Mr Chia, the solicitor
                    acting on behalf of the first family, should have set out the breakdown of the
                    assets in KSB’s estate. Having failed to do so, the deed of consent is
                    thereby set aside for non-disclosure of material facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In arriving at this finding, I acknowledge

                    Plaintiff, KSE and LS were kept informed about the assets in KSB’s estate.
                    Looking at the evidence as a whole, I cannot accept this as being a true account
                    of the events which had taken place in the light of the overwhelming evidence
                    pointing otherwise – that the Plaintiff, KSE and LS were relatively
                    clueless even up to 2012. In fact, Mr Chia gave evidence that he usually
                    informed either KHE or HPJ (especially after KHE’s demise), or towards the
                    later stage of the proceedings, the Defendants, and trusted them to pass on the
                    message to the Plaintiff, KSE or LS. Based on the evidence placed before me,
                    that was clearly not done.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In law, it is undisputed that undue influence
                    is a recognised ground for setting aside a family arrangement. In fact, it has
                    been observed that apart from the specific issue of parental influence, a family
                    arrangement would generally be subject to the usual rules of undue influence
                    applicable to ordinary contracts (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws
                        of England</em>, vol 91 (Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2012) at para
                    922).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Having considered the evidence before me, I am
                    unable to accept the Plaintiff’s argument that she had been labouring
                    under KHE’s undue influence when she signed the deed of consent. In the
                    first place, it is noted that KHE did not make any promises or threats, express
                    or otherwise, to pressure the Plaintiff into signing the deed of consent. The
                    Plaintiff’s entire case for undue influence appeared to rest on the
                    allegation that KHE had raised his voice during the meeting on 8 July 2010. In
                    this respect, it is undisputed that the meeting had taken place in Mr
                    Chia’s office. I am of the view that Mr Chia would have interfered in the
                    dispute if it had escalated out of hand, as the Plaintiff has alleged. In fact,
                    under cross-examination by Dr Raman, the Plaintiff acknowledged that she did not
                    inform Mr Chia about the pressure which KHE had exerted on them:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>

                            signed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Furthermore, it is undisputed that Mr Hoo
                    was also present at the time when Mr Chia had explained the deed of consent to
                    the members of the first family. On that basis, the Plaintiff clearly had ample
                    opportunity to bring any such allegations of undue influence to the attention of
                    the solicitors who were present at that time. Looking at the evidence as a
                    whole, I am of the view that there was no undue influence being exerted at the
                    point in time when the deed of consent was entered into. Coupled with the fact
                    that I have already set aside the deed of consent on the ground of
                    non-disclosure of material facts, I say no more about the Plaintiff’s
                    arguments on undue influence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The deed of family arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    At the outset, it is noted that unlike the
                    letter of consent and the deed of consent, the deed of family arrangement was
                    not signed by the Plaintiff. The only signatories of the deed of the family
                    arrangement are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Defendants, on behalf of the
                        first family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     GAP and KGH, on behalf of the second family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21_21"></a>Therefore, from the perspective of the
                    first family, the issue of whether the deed of family arrangement is to be
                    upheld will depend on whether the Defendants had the authority to act on behalf
                    of the first family (including the Plaintiff, KSE and LS) to enter into the deed
                    of family arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Plaintiff has argued that the deed of
                    family arrangement was entered into without the knowledge, concurrence or
                    approval of the Plaintiff, KSE and LS. In the event that the deed of consent was
                    found to be binding, it was further submitted that the Plaintiff had signed the
                    deed of consent to only grant the Defendants and/or the Defendants’
                    solicitors the authority to <em>negotiate</em> on their
                    behalf, but not the authority to enter into a binding settlement without the
                    knowledge and approval of the Plaintiff, KSE and LS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In response, the Defendants have relied on
                    the following grounds to support their position that the deed of family
                    arrangement ought to be upheld:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Defendants and/or the
                        Defendants’ solicitors had actual authority, either express or
                        implied, from the deed of consent to enter into a binding settlement with
                        the second family (“the first ground”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the doctrine of relation back
                        should apply to validate the deed of family arrangement as it was made for
                        the benefit of KSB’s estate (“the second ground”);
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the
                        court should exercise its discretion to authorise the deed of family
                        arrangement pursuant to s 56(1) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed)
                        (“the Trustees Act”) (“the third
                        ground”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Given my earlier finding that the deed of
                    consent ought to be invalidated or set aside, the first ground would inevitably
                    fail as the Defendants and/or the Defendants’ solicitors would not be able
                    to derive any authority from the deed of consent. Nevertheless, for
                    completeness, I will still proceed to address the first ground relied upon by
                    the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In essence, the Defendants have argued that
                    in the event where the deed of consent is found to be valid, they (including
                    their solicitors) would have the authority, whether express or implied, to enter
                    into the deed of family arrangement on behalf of the first family. In this
                    respect, the Defendants have relied on cl 2 of the deed of consent which, for
                    convenience, is reproduced as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the Parties hereto consent agree to and authorise KUEK SIANG WEI and

                        firm or firms (“the Lawyers”) on behalf of the Parties hereto
                        to enter into negotiations with the Second Family and/or their solicitors
                        for an amicable resolution of the dispute over the estate of the Deceased
                            [<em>ie</em>, KSB] between the Second Family and
                        the Parties mentioned in the recital above (“the Dispute”), to
                        complete the application for Grant of Letters of Administration on behalf of
                        the estate of the Deceased, to institute or defend proceedings in Court in
                        connection with the Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22_22"></a>In response, the Plaintiff submitted that
                    cl 2 of the deed of consent only granted the Defendants and/or their solicitors
                    the authority to <em>negotiate</em> on her behalf, but not
                    to enter into a <em>binding</em> settlement without the
                    knowledge and approval of the Plaintiff, KSE and LS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    At this juncture, it is emphasised once
                    again that the deed of consent is not a usual deed entered into between
                    commercial parties at arm’s length. It is a family arrangement. It is
                    therefore important to adopt a different approach towards such family
                    arrangements, as has been highlighted in <em>Halsbury’s
                        Laws of England</em>, vol 91 (Butterworths, 5th Ed, 2012) at para
                    906:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to
                        dealings between strangers. When deciding the rights of parties under a
                        family arrangement or a claim to upset such an arrangement, the court
                        considers what <em>in the broadest view of the matter is most
                            in the interest of the family</em>, and has regard to
                        considerations which, in dealing with transactions between persons not
                        members of the same family, would not be taken into account. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In <em>Sheares
                        Betty</em>, V K Rajah J (as he then was) made the following pertinent
                    observations at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It can be concluded from these established principles of law and practice
                        that the arrangement the Beneficiaries and the Settlor entered into was
                            <em>not a mere ordinary contractual or trust
                            arrangement</em>. Each and every one of them signed the [deed of
                        family arrangement] which in turn contemplated the execution of the [deed of
                        trust] by the Settlor. It cannot be gainsaid that the Deeds ought to be
                        interpreted harmoniously and cumulatively. Given the Settlor's and the
                        Beneficiaries' manifest intentions at the material time, the Deeds <em>should not be interpreted with an excessive degree of
                            formalism</em>. <em>The task of the court in
                            construing such documents is to resolve upon a fair reading of the
                            documents what the Settlor's intention was, and to give effect to
                            it</em>. In doing so, the court will seek assistance from and
                        apply established rules of construction. The crux of the matter is that
                        these documents constitute a solemn family arrangement signed by all
                            the <em>dramatis personae</em>. This is not an
                        instance where the label “family arrangement” has been loosely
                        affixed in an attempt to invoke special legal consideration. All the classic
                        hallmarks of a family arrangement prevail in this case: <em>a
                            pre-existing family dispute, a clearly declared intention to resolve
                            outstanding matters and a series of arrangements to address the
                            outstanding matters</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23_23"></a>Therefore, it bears emphasising that in
                    ascertaining the scope of authority that the Defendants (and/or their
                    solicitors) derived from cl 2 of the deed of consent, the court will have to
                    adopt a flexible and context-specific approach, as opposed to a rigid and
                    formalistic approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In that regard, I am of the judgment that in
                    the event where the deed of consent is upheld, the Defendants would have the
                    authority not only to <em>negotiate</em>, as the Plaintiff
                    has argued, but to also enter into a <em>binding</em>
                    settlement with the second family on behalf of the first family. It bears
                    emphasising that cl 2 of the deed of consent specifically states that the
                    Defendants (and/or their solicitors) were authorised to enter into negotiations
                    with the second family “for an amicable resolution” of the dispute
                    between the first family and the second family. In fact, it also goes on to
                    state that the Defendants were also authorised to “complete the
                    application for Grant of Letters of Administration on behalf of the estate of
                    KSB”. In ascertaining the scope of cl 2 of the deed of consent, it is
                    useful to consider the prevailing circumstances at the point in time when the
                    deed of consent was entered into by the members of the first
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    On 26 April 2010, GAP and her daughter, KGH,
                    had applied to be added as administrators of KSB’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> This was
                    followed soon after by the lodging of a caveat against KSB’s estate on 30
                    April 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, the court
                    process relating to the administration of KSB’s estate was brought to a
                    standstill. It was under such a circumstance where the members of the first
                    family authorised the Defendants (and/or their solicitors) to enter in
                    negotiations with the second family. The administration process would not have
                    been able to proceed if the caveat had not been withdrawn by GAP and KGH.
                    Coupled with the express instructions for the Defendants to <em>complete</em> the application for grant of letters of administration,
                    the parties would, in all likelihood, have intended the Defendants to enter into
                    a binding settlement with the second family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In fact, when the Plaintiff was confronted
                    with the question of the first family having authorised the Defendants (and/or

                    second family, the Plaintiff did not disagree and instead chose to stick to her
                    earlier allegation of having been forced into signing the deed of
                        consent:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Looking at the oral testimonies as a whole,
                    the prevailing circumstances at that time and the structure of the relevant
                    clauses in the deed of consent, I am of the view that cl 2 of the deed of
                    consent conferred on the Defendants (and/or their solicitors) the authority to
                    enter into a binding settlement on behalf of the first family with the second
                    family. The Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendants’ authority was
                    limited to that of entering into negotiations with the second family was
                    excessively formalistic, an approach which had been soundly eschewed by Rajah J
                    in <em>Sheares Betty</em>. Nevertheless, given that I have
                    found the deed of consent to be invalid on the ground of material
                    non-disclosure, the Defendants <em>cannot</em> then rely on
                    cl 2 of the deed of consent as the basis for having the authority to enter into
                    the deed of family arrangement. I therefore proceed to address the
                    Defendants’ second and third arguments in favour of upholding the deed of
                    family arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In response to the Plaintiff’s
                    argument that the grant of letters of administration had not been extracted at
                    the time the deed of family arrangement was entered into, the Defendants argued
                    that the doctrine of relation back should apply to validate the deed of family
                    arrangement as it was made for the benefit of KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The doctrine of relation back in the context
                    of probate and administration was considered in the Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Tacplas Property Services Pte Ltd v Lee Peter Michael
                        (administrator of the estate of Lee Ching Miow, deceased)</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 159 (“<em>Tacplas Property</em>”).
                    In that case, it was held that while the property of the estate would vest in
                    the administrator upon the grant of letters of administration, such vesting did
                    not confer on the administrator the authority to deal with those assets until
                    the <em>order of the grant</em> was extracted. In that
                    regard, the authority of an administrator to deal with the assets of the
                    deceased’s estate stemmed from the extracted grant, without which the
                    administrator had no authority. Chao Hick Tin JA, in delivering the judgment of
                    the court, made the following observations at [44] on the doctrine of relation
                    of back:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The administrator’s title to the assets of the estate vests in
                        him from the time the grant of the letters of administration is extracted.
                        The doctrine of relation back is an exception to that rule. The doctrine
                        permits the title of the administrator to relate back to the time of the
                        death of the deceased so as to give validity to certain acts done by an
                        administrator before the letters of administration are extracted. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In my judgment, the doctrine of relation
                    back is not applicable to the present case given that both the letter of consent
                    and the deed of consent have been set aside. In the circumstances, the
                    Defendants did not have the requisite authority to enter into the deed of family
                    arrangement, which clearly envisaged different entitlements from the default
                    position as set out in the ISA. Given that KSB had passed away intestate, the
                    only way in which a distribution other than that set out in the ISA is to be
                    upheld would be in a situation where <em>all</em> potential
                    beneficiaries agree to compromise their claims under the ISA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    it bears emphasising that the letter of consent and the deed of consent have
                    been found to be invalid. The default position under the ISA would therefore
                    apply. Given that the deed of family arrangement purported to give rise to a
                    distribution that differed from the default position under the ISA, it would not
                    have any legal effect in the absence of consent by the relevant parties. The
                    doctrine of relation back is therefore not applicable in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Finally, the Defendants have also submitted
                    that the court should exercise its powers under s 56(1) of the Trustees Act to
                    authorise the deed of family arrangement. Unfortunately, the Plaintiff’s
                    reliance on s 56(1) of the Trustees Act suffers from the same setback as
                    that under the second ground relating to the doctrine of relation
                back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In the High Court decision of <em>Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 211, Judith Prakash J observed at [35] that s 56(1) of the
                    Trustees Act “deals with the situation where there is the <em>absence</em> of a trustee power to manage the trust property,
                    and the court finds that it is expedient to confer such power on the
                    trustee” [emphasis in original]. Meanwhile, in the High Court decision of
                        <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 453, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) referred to the earlier Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Rajabali Jumabhoy v Ameerali R
                        Jumabhoy</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 434 and held at [11] that the
                    court’s power under s 56(1) of the TA in relation to the management and
                    administration of trust property were limited by the express terms of the trust
                    instrument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In my judgment, s 56(1) of the TA cannot be
                    invoked to empower the Defendants to enter into the deed of family arrangement.
                    At the outset, it must be recognised that s 56(1) of the TA exists for the
                    purpose of enabling a trustee to <em>manage</em> and
                        <em>administer</em> trust property. What the deed of
                    family arrangement purports to do is to <em>vary</em> the
                    distribution of the assets of KSB’s estate. As already discussed in the
                    previous section on the doctrine of relation back, given that KSB had passed
                    away intestate (<em>ie</em>, without a <em>valid</em> will), as the note did not comply with the requirements of
                    the Wills Act, the rules under the ISA would govern the distribution of
                    KSB’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In the present case, the Defendants will
                    only be able to distribute the assets of KSB in accordance with the note in the
                    event where all potential beneficiaries taking under the ISA agree to compromise
                    their claims. Given that the Plaintiff, KSE and presumably, LS, had not
                    consented to the distribution of KSB’s assets in accordance to the note
                    (as both the letter of consent and the deed of consent have been found to be
                    invalid), the Defendants would be bound to distribute the assets in KSB’s
                    estate in accordance with the default position set out in the ISA. The
                    Defendants cannot rely on s 56(1) of the TA to uphold the deed of family
                    arrangement as that would be akin to the court varying the distribution of
                    KSB’s estate without the consent of all potential beneficiaries under the
                    ISA. The Defendants’ argument based on s 56(1) of the TA is therefore
                    rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In the light of the reasons set out above, I
                    granted the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a>(a)     the letter of consent, the deed of
                        consent and the deed of family arrangement are set aside;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Defendants, who remain as
                        administrators of KSB’s estate pursuant to the court order dated 12
                        April 2011 granted by the Subordinate Courts, are to undertake all necessary
                        steps (including, but not limited to, the recovery of any assets which have
                        already been distributed, the ascertainment of the status of the second
                        family under the ISA) to distribute KSB’s assets in accordance with
                        the ISA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a>(c)     the above two orders shall be without prejudice to any party applying for
                        the removal and/or replacement of the Defendants as administrators of
                        KSB’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25_25"></a>I note that the Plaintiff has also sought a
                    variety of other remedies concerning the administration of KSB’s estate,
                    such as an order to cease distribution of the assets pending the determination
                    of the present dispute and an account of the rental proceeds in respect of the
                    Malaysian properties. As I have reminded both parties throughout the course of
                    the trial, the action before me concerned the validity of the letter of consent,
                    deed of consent and deed of family arrangement. While I allowed counsel for both
                    parties some leeway to introduce evidence concerning the administration of
                    KSB’s estate, that was for the sole purpose of setting out the background
                    facts to the legal dispute at hand. The issue of whether the Defendants have
                    breached their duties as administrators of KSB’s estate, or the legality
                    of HPJ’s actions in Malaysia are not before me in the present action. I
                    therefore decline to make any further orders which the Plaintiff has requested,
                    apart from those set out above.</p>
