In the context of the regime for mandatory treatment orders (“MTOs”), it is argued that judicial power is infringed as the determination by a psychiatrist appointed by the Director of Medical Services of the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) is “final and conclusive” on whether an offender is suitable to be sentenced to an MTO. It is also argued that this amounts to a breach of an offender’s right to equal protection under Art 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”), as such an arrogation of the determination of factual matters do not take place in other laws which provide for psychiatric conditions to function as a defence or mitigating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After hearing parties on the matter, I am of the view that the constitutional challenge does not have merit.

</div> The court has no power to impose an MTO if the psychiatrist’s report states that one or more of the criteria is not satisfied, and the findings of the psychiatrist in this regard are final and conclusive. The Appellant submits that the criteria triggering the court’s discretion to impose an MTO are therefore “solely decided by the appointed psychiatrist and not the court, even though they involve questions of fact which ought to have been adjudicated upon by the court”.

</div> The Psychiatrist had stated in the MTO Suitability Report that she relied upon several sources of information, but made no mention of the Appellant’s Reports. As such, due to the unconstitutionality of the MTO Provisions as well as non-compliance with s 339(8), a Newton hearing ought to be convened in respect of the MTO Suitability Report and on the issue of whether the Appellant’s psychiatric conditions had contributed to his offending.

</div> Thus, ss 339(3) and (4) ensure that the court only sentences an offender to an MTO after the IMH has found him clinically suitable for such an order; and s 339(9) ensures that the court does not impose an MTO simply because it takes a different view from the appointed psychiatrist on the s 339(3) criteria. The Prosecutor argues that the courts have “consistently held” that statutory preconditions to sentencing such as ss 339(3) and (4) do not intrude into judicial power, and have given effect to provisions such as s 339(9), which treat as conclusive findings of fact by a statutorily designated fact-finder other than the courts.

First, s 339(2) provides that the court must call for an MTO suitability report before it can order an MTO, having regard to the guidance in s 339(1), namely “the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender”. Second, an MTO may be ordered only if an appointed psychiatrist (that is, a psychiatrist appointed by the Director of Medical Services of the MOH) is of the view that all the conditions in s 339(3) are satisfied. In assessing whether an offender satisfies s 339(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), s 339(5) also indicates several factors which the appointed psychiatrist may take into account, including whether the offender is likely to attend the treatment sessions as required, his physical and mental state, and his financial standing and ability to pay for his treatment. Third, even if the appointed psychiatrist is satisfied that the cumulative conditions in s 339(3) are met, the court retains a discretion whether or not to order an MTO. This is because s 339(1) provides that the court may make such an order where it is satisfied that “it is expedient to do so”. To this, I add that the language of s 339(9) is clear: an MTO suitability report is “final and conclusive” regarding whether or not the requirements in s 339(3) have been met in respect of an offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The rationale for s 339(9) was explained by Ms Indranee Rajah (“Ms Rajah”), then Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance, during the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill (No 14 of 2018) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 March 2018) vol 94). In response to a point raised by Mr Murali Pillai (“Mr Pillai”), Member of Parliament for Bukit Batok, that the court’s determination on whether to impose an MTO ought not be “constrained by the sole professional judgement of the appointed psychiatrist”, Ms Rajah stated that since the IMH is generally “the institution to administer treatment under the MTO, there is a concern of conflict of medical ethics if IMH were to be asked to treat a person it believes does not have a treatable mental condition. The current position therefore aligns the diagnostic and treatment elements of MTOs”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Before turning to discuss the constitutionality of the MTO Provisions, I pause to note that following from the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan Chandaram v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2020] 2 SLR 95 (“<span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han Jolovan v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham</span>”), the presumption of constitutionality can be “no more than a starting point that legislation will not presumptively be treated as suspect or unconstitutional” (<span class="font-italic">Saravanan </span>at [154]; <span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham </span>at [26]). That being said, in analysing the constitutionality of any law, the court must bear in mind that “each branch of Government has its own role and space” (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan Wham </span>at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Constitutionality under Article 93</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I find that the MTO Provisions and s 339(9) of the CPC in particular do not violate Art 93 of the Constitution, that is, there is no infringement of the judicial power which is exclusively vested in the courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Article 93 of the Constitution reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judicial power of Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">93.</span>  The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The focus of the Appellant’s argument is that Art 93 is violated because s 339(9) of the CPC allows the determination of the criteria under s 339(3) of the CPC to be “arrogated to the appointed psychiatrist alone”. It leaves the court with “no power to adjudicate on disputes of fact”, should an accused person wish to challenge the determination by the appointed psychiatrist “on any basis”.

It has been defined as being concerned with the determination of controversies or questions between persons or groups of persons (<span class="font-italic">Mohammad</span><span class="font-italic"> Faizal </span>at [20]–[21] and [24]; citing cases such as <span class="font-italic">Huddart, </span><span class="font-italic">Parker and Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead</span> (1909) 8 CLR 330, <span class="font-italic">The Queen v The Trade Practices Tribunal</span><span class="font-italic">; Ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Pty Ltd</span> (1970) 123 CLR 361, and <span class="font-italic">Nicholas v The Queen</span> (1998) 193 CLR 173). In <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span>, which concerned a challenge to mandatory minimum punishment under s 33A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), Chan Sek Keong CJ further noted that the “judicial function entails the courts making a finding on the facts as they stand, applying the relevant law to those facts and determining the rights and obligations of the parties concerned for the purposes of governing their relationship for the future” (at [27]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 However, it is not a breach of Art 93 for the Legislature to statutorily designate a fact-finder other than the courts. For example, the determination of whether an offender has provided substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA has been upheld as being within the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor and not a violation of the principle of the separation of powers (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span>”) at [76]; <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar bin Othman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1394 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar</span>”) at [40], [49] and [52]; <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 216 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [67]). Apart from the fact that s 33B of the MDA “expressly confers upon the [Public Prosecutor] the discretion to make the decision on substantive assistance”, it was emphasised that the question as to whether there has been the requisite disruption to drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore is an “operational one” for which the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) and the Public Prosecutor have “distinctive expertise” (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1222 at [66]; <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In a similar vein, the criteria under s 339(3) of the CPC are questions of fact which the appointed psychiatrist is best placed to determine. The relevant Parliamentary debates (as noted at [16] above) also clarify why the appointed psychiatrist should determine these questions. Apart from the need to prevent a conflict of medical ethics, wherein the IMH would be compelled to “treat a person it believes does not have a treatable mental condition”, it is also difficult to imagine the purpose of the MTO regime being met in such instances. As noted by See J in <span class="font-italic">GCX</span>, the MTO was part of a suite of community-based sentencing options introduced by Parliament via amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code in 2010, and was intended to give “more flexibility to the courts” (at [31]–[32]; citing the Second Reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill 2010 (No 11 of 2010), <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law). The MTO targets persons with specific and minor mental conditions where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing principle. In such cases, by drawing on resources in the community, “the offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment”. It is not clear that there can in fact be focused treatment if the IMH is, for example, of the view that there is no contributory link between an offender’s psychiatric condition and his commission of the offence (as required by s 339(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Counsel for the Appellant referred to several cases in which it was specified that it is the court that should determine certain facts, not the expert. These included the following: (a) <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai</span>”); (b) <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2020] 3 SLR 825 (“<span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span>”) and (c) <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat</span>”). In my view, these cases did not quite address the present situation, namely one where the Legislature has designated that the Executive shall decide certain facts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai</span>, concerning a conviction for murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), a crucial issue to be determined was how the accused person sustained his wounds, as it would enable the court to evaluate the viability of his defences to the charge. The Court of Appeal observed that the trial judge had, following from equivocal expert evidence, concluded that these injuries “<span class="font-italic">may </span>have been inflicted by the accused <span class="font-italic">or </span>the deceased” [emphasis in original] (at [43]). It considered that this was an error on his part, as (at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Expert evidence will not always offer a clear answer to every question before the court. This does not excuse a judge from making a crucial finding of fact. Ultimately, all questions – whether of law or of fact – placed before a court are intended to be adjudicated and decided by a judge and not by experts. An expert or scientific witness is there only to assist the court in arriving at its decisions; he or she is not there to arrogate the court’s functions to himself or herself. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu</span>, the High Court considered the relevance and admissibility of certain psychiatric reports which opined that the accused person was acting under the influence of a mental illness at the material time when she committed various acts of abuse against her domestic helper. The opinions provided that she had suffered from major depressive disorder with psychotic features, these being auditory hallucinations which were causally linked to her offending. However, the opinions were based on the accused’s self-reports and the accused did not testify, which called into question the factual basis for the expert evidence. Sundaresh Menon CJ observed that the expert evidence, insofar as it purported to opine on whether the appellant did in fact hear voices at the material time, “c[ame] close to contravening the ultimate issue rule”, which “[i]n orthodox terms … provides that an expert should not give evidence on the ultimate issue, which is to be decided by the court. Its rationale is that this would usurp the role of the court as the trier of fact” (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Appellant points to an observation by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Anita Damu </span>that “the responsibility to adjudicate on the issues that are before the court is the court’s alone, and it is incumbent on the court to satisfy itself that any expert evidence it is invited to accept is first, relevant and admissible, and then, coherent and resting on sound premises” (at [1]). Following from that, as well as the statement by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai </span>against an expert or scientific witness arrogating the court’s functions to himself, the Appellant argues that s 339(9) of the CPC is tantamount to “allow[ing] the determination of the criteria under s 339(3) of the CPC to be arrogated to the appointed psychiatrist alone, leaving the courts with no power to adjudicate on disputes of fact” should the accused person wish to “challenge the appointed psychiatrist’s opinion on any basis”.

This provided that culpable homicide is not murder where the offender “was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by death or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions” in causing or being party to causing the death. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat</span> at [79] noted that the exception stipulated three distinct requirements, namely that the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind (“the first limb”); such abnormality of mind arose from the causes defined therein (“the second limb”); and that it substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death (“the third limb”). The court observed that it was “well established” that while the second limb was “a matter largely to be determined based on expert evidence, the first and third limbs are matters which cannot be the subject of any medical opinion and must be left to the determination of the trial judge as the finder of fact” (at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Appellant argues that the scope of the inquiry under s 339(3) of the CPC is “much narrower” than the inquiry into an “abnormality of mind” under Exception 7 of the PC, and that the Court of Appeal’s use of the words “largely to be determined based on expert evidence” in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat </span>at [80] (as mentioned in [29]) suggests that even that requirement of the root cause of the abnormality of mind is a dispute of fact to be adjudicated upon by the court.

</div> The conclusiveness of the expert evidence on this issue has also been crystallised in legislation via s 339(9) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The proper conclusion, to my mind, is that where a particular law leaves the matter for judicial determination, it is true that the court should decide. This is an aspect of the ultimate issue rule, reflecting that expert opinion cannot be determinative. Although the expert can offer his opinion hypothetically on the very issue which the court has to decide, it is for the trier of fact to determine what had actually taken place in the circumstances (Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 16 January 2021) at para 8.037). In the modern context, the rule entails that “the judge must discharge his responsibility as the adjudicator to rule on the ultimate issue. In doing so, he must not simply adopt the expert’s opinion on that issue without satisfying himself that this is the correct outcome”, and should nevertheless engage in the established practices of “sifting, weighing and evaluating the objective facts within their circumstantial matrix and context in order to arrive at a final finding of fact” (<span class="font-italic">Anita Damu </span>at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim Hoklai </span>at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, the ultimate issue rule and the cases on expert opinions do not assist in making out a breach of Art 93. The present case is not one in which the discretion resides in the court. Section 339 of the CPC does not in fact confer it upon the court. The psychiatric assessment of the matters in s 339(3) of the CPC is left in the hands of the appointed psychiatrist, and the court has no role to play in considering or weighing the assessment. For similar reasons, I do not think it assists the Appellant to argue that s 339(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC is comparable to the question of fact to be determined under the third limb of Exception 7 of the PC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the abnormality of mind substantially impaired an accused person’s mental responsibility for causing the death of another person.

</div> It seems to me that the language of s 339 as outlined above (at [14]–[15]) and accordingly the intention of Parliament is clear. The relevant Parliamentary debates have also reinforced its intention that the inquiry under s 339(3) of the CPC should be for the sole professional judgment of the appointed psychiatrist. That inquiry is also one for which the appointed psychiatrist has the appropriate institutional competence, given that the IMH will generally administer treatment under an MTO.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The reviewability of a determination under s 339(3) by the appointed psychiatrist </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It is also not a breach of Art 93 for s 339(9) of the CPC to stipulate that an MTO suitability report will be “final and conclusive” as to the matters in s 339(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As argued by the Prosecution, the courts have recognised and given effect to conclusive evidence clauses in respect of decisions by an administrative body which involve a degree of fact-finding and judgment. This was the case in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 507 (“<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (HC)</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 568 (“<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (CA)</span>”) concerning s 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act (Cap 152, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), which provides that a notification that land to be acquired is needed for specific purposes “shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for the purpose specified therein as provided in [s 5(1)]”. The plaintiff had essentially argued that the defendant, the Collector of Land Revenue, acted in bad faith by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>acquiring its land in 1983 when it was declared to be needed for “a public purpose, viz.: General Redevelopment”, but was not redeveloped over the following 22 years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Phang J considered that the meaning of s 5(3) was “clear” and was consistent with the underlying purpose of the Act, particularly with the idea that the relevant government authority was “in the best position to determine whether or not the land concerned is required for one or more of the purposes set out in s 5(1)” (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (HC) </span>at [30]). Yet, a balance was to be struck between “ensuring that the purposes of the Act and the ensuing public benefit are achieved on the one hand and ensuring that there is no abuse of power on the other” (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (HC) </span>at [36]). Accordingly, the courts would intervene in cases of bad faith. The plaintiff’s application for leave to apply for an order of <span class="font-italic">certiorari </span>and an order of <span class="font-italic">mandamus </span>was however dismissed for being out of time and in any event, the plaintiff could not satisfy the threshold for leave to be granted, since the power of acquisition had clearly been exercised by the defendant in good faith and in accordance with the requirements in s 5. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Phang J, and expressed the view that the defendant (the respondent on appeal) could not however rely on s 5(3) of the Act to decline to offer any explanation for the delay. This was because “when the allegation of bad faith is founded on a very substantial period of inaction, an explanation should be given” (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (CA) </span>at [38]). In the absence of such an explanation, “[p]rolonged inaction … could constitute an arguable case or a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that the land was not needed for general redevelopment when it was acquired in 1983” (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (CA) </span>at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Although the courts in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (CA) </span>did not directly consider an argument on Art 93 of the Constitution, which was not raised by the plaintiff, the acceptance of the effects of such a clause (in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh (HC))</span> and the recognition of its limits (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the view that such clauses do not preclude judicial review on the basis of bad faith) militates against a finding that s 339(9) of the CPC breaches Art 93. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Significantly, s 339(9) does not on its face go so far as to preclude judicial review in general, such that a wrong decision by an administrative decision-maker cannot be called into question (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [45]). In this regard, it may be compared with clauses which provide that such decisions “shall not be challenged in any court”, as in s 14(5) of the Employment Act (Cap 91, 1996 Rev Ed), which was considered in <span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd v Minister for Manpower (formerly known as Minister for Labour) </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 866 and has since been repealed; or s 47(2) of the Industrial Relations Act (Cap 136, 2004 Rev Ed), which also sought to limit the available judicial remedies by providing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that no award or decision by amongst others the Industrial Arbitration Court “shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any court”. The operation of such clauses is not before me in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Indeed, the reviewability of a determination by the appointed psychiatrist as regards the s 339(3) criteria, in light of s 339(9), was addressed by See Kee Oon JC in <span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>(at [11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To my mind, if an obvious clerical or administrative error results in the wrong report (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, one which contains wholly erroneous contents) being tendered to the court, surely that “opinion” cannot be accepted as being “final and conclusive” such that the court is precluded from seeking any clarification whatsoever. Alternatively, if the report erroneously draws conclusions that are obviously at odds or internally inconsistent with the remainder of the report, it surely cannot be that the court is expected to unquestioningly adopt such conclusions on account of the report being “final and conclusive”. I do not see why there must be a blanket prohibition on any form of enquiry or clarification if the report is unclear and particularly where it draws manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It thus remains open to the court to question apparent issues of accuracy with the conclusions in the report. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of s 339 of the CPC on sentencing discretion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is additionally not a breach of Art 93 that as a result of the MTO Provisions, the availability of an MTO as a sentencing option is decided by the appointed psychiatrist and not the court.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Singapore cases on judicial power in the context of sentencing discretion have held that the prescription of punishment for offences is an aspect of legislative, and not judicial power (<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span> at [45]). This does not however mean that the entire sentencing function including the determination of the appropriate punishment may be intruded upon by other branches of the state, as subsequently clarified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [60]). Rather, while the Legislature can prescribe punishment, the selection of the appropriate punishment in the exercise of sentencing discretion conferred by statute belongs to the court. That is, “the judicial power in sentencing is the power to ‘determine the appropriate punishment for a particular offender’” (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar</span> at [38], citing <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [61]). In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span> endorsed the holding in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [45] (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [60]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since the power to prescribe punishments for offences is part of the legislative power and not the judicial power (as Commonwealth and US case law shows), it must follow that no written law of general application prescribing any kind of punishment for an offence, whether such punishment be mandatory or discretionary and whether it be fixed or within a prescribed range, can trespass onto the judicial power. On the contrary, it is the duty of the courts to inflict the legislatively-prescribed punishments on offenders, exercising such discretion as may have been given to them by the Legislature to select the punishments which they think appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Judicial power therefore relates to the courts’ exercise of discretion within the parameters conferred by the law enacted by the Legislature. It is within the ambit of the legislative power to specify that a particular act will be an offence, and that the punishment will only be a specific sentence for all cases. Art 93 is not breached in such circumstances, as may be seen from cases involving the mandatory death penalty. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 103, it was argued that a mandatory death penalty, which had in that case been imposed for an offence of drug importation, infringed the principle of the separation of powers as the discretionary power to determine the severity of punishment to be inflicted on an individual member of a class of offenders should be for the Judiciary (at [96]). The Court of Appeal, which found as well that the mandatory death penalty for the offence did not breach Arts 9(1) or 12(1) of the Constitution, observed that recent Privy Council decisions also had not declared mandatory death sentences absolutely unconstitutional. The constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty in the context of a similar challenge on Arts 9(1) and 12(1) was affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2010] 3 SLR 489 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong</span>”). There, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that “[i]t is for Parliament, and not the courts, to decide on the appropriateness or suitability of the [mandatory death penalty] as a form of punishment for serious criminal offences” (at [122]). That did not however mean that Art 9(1), which provides for a deprivation of life “in accordance with law”, “justif[ies] all legislation, whatever its nature” ([16] and [75], citing Lord Diplock in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1981] AC 648 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan</span>”) at 659). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Moses Hinds v </span><span class="font-italic">The Queen </span>[1977] AC 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Hinds</span>”), Lord Diplock observed that a fixed punishment for a defined offence, such as capital punishment for the crime of murder, could be prescribed by Parliament if it thought fit (at 226). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  By the same token, it is not an infringement of Art 93 for Parliament to prescribe minimum sentences for an offence (<span class="font-italic">Hinds </span>at 226; <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [45]; <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [60]; <span class="font-italic">R v Ironside </span>[2009] SASC 151 at [150]). Thus, the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago in <span class="font-italic">Francis and Another v State </span>[2015] 2 LRC 244 held, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, that the creation of mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking did not violate the principle of the separation of powers (citing amongst others <span class="font-italic">Hinds</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 225–227). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It is also within the legislative power to specify by statute punishment or programs operating in lieu of punishment that may be limited by age or other qualifications. Age stipulations are in place, for instance, in respect of caning as a punishment and the imposition of or eligibility for certain regimes, such as reformative training, corrective training and preventive detention, and probation. These operate to limit the Judiciary’s power to impose such sentences but do not infringe Art 93, as they do not purport to decide the matter in a specific case, or a particular controversy between the State and a specific individual. As stated by the Supreme Court of Ireland in <span class="font-italic">Reginald D</span><span class="font-italic">eaton v The Attorney General and the Revenue Commissioners </span>[1963] IR 170 (“<span class="font-italic">Deaton</span>”) (at 182–183, as endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Hinds </span>at 226–227, and cited in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [43] and <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [61]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a clear distinction between the prescription of a fixed penalty and the selection of a penalty for a particular case. The prescription of a fixed penalty is the statement of a general rule, which is one of the characteristics of legislation; this is wholly different from the selection of a penalty to be imposed in a particular case. … The Legislature does not prescribe the penalty to be imposed in an individual citizen’s case; it states the general rule, and the application of that rule is for the [c]ourts … the selection of punishment is an integral part of the administration of justice and, as such, cannot be committed to the hands of the Executive …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the present case, the MTO regime is an alternative sentencing option. Section 339 of the CPC operates alongside the prescribed sentencing provisions for each charge; that is, it gives the court an additional sentencing option, provided satisfaction of the requirements in ss 337 (which sets out offences and persons in respect of which community-based sentences, including MTOs, may not be made) and 339(1), including an MTO suitability report which fulfils the criteria in s 339(3).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Thus, here, in respect of the Appellant’s offences under s 509 of the Penal Code, the court would be able to sentence him to an MTO, or fine and/or imprisonment. In determining the quantum, the court would of course have regard to the circumstances of the case, any mitigation from the Appellant, and any applicable sentencing benchmarks. The fact that s 339 of the CPC is but one sentencing option substantially weakens the argument that there is an encroachment into judicial power. The court remains free to impose other sentences. The court’s discretion is thus not circumscribed in any event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the issue of whether it infringes Art 93 as the extent of punishment to be imposed is affected by an executive decision, while such a discretion should ordinarily be for the court with the duty of imposing punishment, it is open to the Legislature to determine “whether or not such a discretion shall be given to the court in relation to a statutory offence” (<span class="font-italic">Palling v Corfield </span>(1970) 123 CLR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Palling</span>”) at 58–59, as cited in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [34]). As held by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">State of South Australia v Totani </span>(2010) 271 ALR 662 (“<span class="font-italic">Totani</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [71] <span class="font-italic">per </span>French CJ, citing <span class="font-italic">Palling</span>; as cited in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Faizal </span>at [48]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has been accepted by this court that the Parliament of the Commonwealth may pass a law which requires a court exercising federal jurisdiction to make specified orders if some conditions are met even if satisfaction of such conditions depends upon a decision or decisions of the executive government or one of its authorities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As such, in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span>, Chan CJ held that it was not an infringement of the principle of the separation of powers for various subsections of s 33A of the MDA to direct the courts to impose a mandatory minimum punishment on the occurrence of certain factors, which included an executive decision – there, the decision of the Director of the CNB under s 34 of the MDA to admit an individual to a drug rehabilitation centre. Similarly, in the present case, the decision of the appointed psychiatrist as to whether an accused person has met the criteria under s 339(3) of the CPC is a factor which could lead to a particular sentencing outcome. Unlike mandatory minimum sentencing, it does not even compel the court to impose an MTO (see [54] below). It is therefore difficult to see how Art 93 could be infringed in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Indeed, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prab</span><span class="font-italic">agaran </span>demonstrates that it is not a violation of Art 93 to legislatively prescribe that the court’s discretion to impose an alternative sentence is conditional upon the exercise of executive power. As mentioned at [23] above, <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>concerned a challenge to ss 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 33B(4) of the MDA on the basis that they were in breach of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the principle of the separation of powers. Section 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA confers on the court the discretion to sentence a person, who has been convicted of an offence of drug trafficking or importation or exportation and would otherwise be sentenced to death, to a lesser penalty of life imprisonment. This is where: (a) the person proves on a balance of probabilities that his involvement in the offence was restricted to certain acts prescribed in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that his involvement was that of a courier; and (b) the Public Prosecutor certifies that the person has “substantively assisted the [CNB] in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore” (s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). Further, s 33B(4) provides that the determination of whether or not a person has substantively assisted the CNB in such a manner “shall be at the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor”, against whom “no action or proceeding shall lie” in relation to any such determination, save for on the grounds of bad faith or malice. The applicants argued that the Public Prosecutor’s certification under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA infringed the principle of the separation of powers, and was exacerbated by the fact that the Public Prosecutor’s decision in this regard could only be challenged on the limited grounds in s 33B(4). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the specific question of whether the Public Prosecutor’s determination of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA violated the principle of the separation of powers, the Court of Appeal concluded that it did not as its discretion is “not tailored to the punishment it thinks should be imposed on a particular offender but is circumscribed to the limited question of whether the prescribed criterion … has been satisfied” (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [76]). It remained for the court to determine the guilt of the party and impose the sentence under the Second Schedule to the MDA. The Court of Appeal noted that, apart from the power to prescribe punishment being part of legislative power, the discretion of the Public Prosecutor to issue such a certification was not unfettered, being circumscribed by the legislative purpose and the provision itself (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [72]); and the fact that the Public Prosecutor is uniquely suited to conduct the assessment under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) weighed in favour of a finding of constitutional validity of the provision (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the present case, the inquiry by the appointed psychiatrist is similarly a limited one into whether the criteria in s 339(3) of the CPC have been satisfied. However, the court determines the guilt of the offender and convicts him of the subject offence. The court also ultimately imposes an MTO if it is further satisfied that “it is expedient to do so” (s 339(1)); <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the discretion whether to impose an MTO or the usual sentences of an imprisonment or fine or both remains with the court (see [15] above). The MTO Provisions therefore do not give the appointed psychiatrist “the power to decide the appropriate punishment for a particular offender”, which would be antithetical to judicial power (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar </span>at [40]). Further and in any event, the discretion of the appointed psychiatrist is also not unfettered, in light of some scope for review (see [40] above). The constitutionality of the MTO Provisions is also supported by the fact that the appointed psychiatrist also has the appropriate institutional competence for the inquiry, as further clarified in the relevant Parliamentary debates (see [24] and [33] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, it is noted that in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal</span>, Chan CJ identified three categories of cases which involved the intrusion of judicial power by the Executive through provisions enacted by the Legislature (at [51]–[56]; as cited in <span class="font-italic">Prab</span><span class="font-italic">agaran </span>at [62] and <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar </span>at [44]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Selection of sentence by the Executive, for example, allowing the Executive to elect which of two penalties prescribed were to be imposed by the court (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Deaton </span>(“Category (a)”));</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Administrative decisions by the Executive directly related to the charges brought against particular accused persons, directly impacting the sentence imposed by the court, such as the Executive choosing between two different courts for the same charge, with capital punishment mandatory in one but unavailable in the other (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Muktar Ali v The Queen </span>[1992] 2 AC 93 (“<span class="font-italic">Muktar Ali</span>”) (“Category (b)”)); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Administrative decisions which were not directly related to any charges but which impacted the actual sentence imposed by the court, such that an executive action is disguised as a judicial decision (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Totani</span> (“Category (c)”)).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The MTO Provisions do not fall within any of these categories. As the Prosecution notes and as observed at [15] and [52] above, the court initiates and determines the enquiry into whether an MTO is ordered. It is for the court to call for an MTO suitability report. It does so only if it takes the view that sufficient facts show that the offender has some rehabilitative potential, and that other sentencing principles do not outweigh the prospect of rehabilitation (<span class="font-italic">GCX</span> at [37]; see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdul Fathani Bin Khairuddin</span> [2021] SGDC 143, where the court declined to call for such a report). It also decides whether the report of an appointed psychiatrist meets the requirements of s 339(3), in the limited manner observed in <span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>at [11] (noted at [40] above). The court also determines whether to ultimately impose an MTO (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Lian Koon </span>[2015] SGDC 39, where an MTO was recommended but not ordered). The MTO Provisions therefore do not fall under Category (a), since there is no question of the appointed psychiatrist electing for the relevant penalty. That was the upshot of the impugned provision in <span class="font-italic">Deaton</span>, which provided that an offence would carry the alternative penalties “at the election of the Commissioners of Customs”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For similar reasons, the MTO Provisions also do not fall under Categories (b) or (c). The provisions do not have the effect of empowering a member of the Executive “to <span class="font-italic">choose</span> the court in which to try an offender so as to obtain a <span class="font-italic">particular</span> sentencing result on the facts”, such as in <span class="font-italic">Muktar Ali</span> [emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span>] (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [72], citing <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [57]). The MTO Provisions are additionally markedly different from the impugned legislation in <span class="font-italic">Totani</span>. This compelled the Magistrates Court of South Australia to impose control orders on individuals on a finding that they were members of organisations declared by the Attorney-General of South Australia to be a risk to public safety and order. However, the making of the control order did not involve any finding of criminal guilt, for example, any assessment on the part of the court as to whether a defendant posed a risk to public safety and order by reason of his status or past or threatened conduct (<span class="font-italic">Totani </span>at [434], as noted in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [77]). In contrast, the MTO Provisions do not involve any imposition of sentence without a finding of guilt by the court, and are targeted at the limited, legislatively-prescribed objective of rehabilitation (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal </span>at [57], in relation to the Executive’s exercise of discretion in ordering a drug rehabilitation centre admission under s 34 of the MDA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, the MTO Provisions, which effectively render the availability of an MTO conditional on the decision of the appointed psychiatrist, do not contravene Art 93 of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Constitutionality under Article 12(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I find that the MTO Provisions also do not infringe Art 12(1) of the Constitution. It is doubtful that there was a basis for comparison in the first place so as to engage Art 12(1). In any event, the proposed differentia of offenders with psychiatric conditions <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>eligible for the MTO regime versus those for whom their conditions could be a defence or mitigating factor would satisfy the “reasonable classification” test in relation to determining the constitutionality of a statute under Art 12(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Equal protection</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">12.</span>—(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang</span>”), the Court of Appeal specified that the test of whether legislation is in breach of Art 12(1) is whether the classification was reasonable (the “reasonable classification” test), which requires that (a) the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia (“Limb (a)”); and (b) such differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute (“Limb (b)”) (at [60]). However, in order for the test to be engaged, the impugned statute must be differentiating in the first place (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Appellant points out that the applicable test for determining whether legislation contravenes Art 12(1) is under consideration by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General and other appeals </span>CA/CA 54/2020, CA/CA 55/2020 and CA/CA 71/2020. However, pending any pronouncement by the Court of Appeal, the “reasonable classification” test in <span class="font-italic">Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> Meng Suang</span> remains the applicable law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Appellant argues based on the “reasonable classification” test that in contrast to other laws, which provide for psychiatric conditions to function as a defence or mitigating factor, the MTO Provisions arrogate the determination of factual matters to the appointed psychiatrist, depriving the accused person of any opportunity to challenge these findings.

</div>
</div> Furthermore, it contends that the differentia in the MTO Provisions bear a rational relation to the object of the provisions, namely, to ensure the feasibility of an MTO by ascertaining whether the IMH can treat the offender and that such treatment is relevant to his offending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I could not see how Art 12(1) is even engaged by the MTO regime. By its very nature, Art 12(1) can only operate in comparing one situation and another: there is no breach if there is no comparison that can be made to begin with. The Appellant pointed to the differences between a situation where an MTO may be available as a sentencing option, and those where psychiatric conditions are available as defences or as mitigating factors. But there is no comparability; there is no measuring of like with like, as required in an assessment of equality before the law and equal protection of the law (<span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan</span> at 673; <span class="font-italic">Nguyen</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [82]). The former is concerned with a type of sentence, the latter with either the establishing of a defence to a charge or attenuating the culpability of an accused person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There is therefore no scope for the question of intelligible differentia to even arise. For that reason alone, Art 12(1) is not even engaged. I am thus also somewhat doubtful that any alternative test formulated by the Court of Appeal would affect the outcome in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In any event, even if the two situations are indeed comparable, the MTO regime does contain sufficient factors to amount to intelligible differentia. Limb (a) of the “reasonable classification” test requires that the differentia is understandable, and not “so unreasonable as to be illogical and/or incoherent” such as, possibly, a law which bans all women from driving on the roads (<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span>at [67] and [114]). This connotes a “relatively low threshold” (<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span>at [65]) which would be satisfied on the facts. In the present case, there is little difficulty understanding the classification prescribed by the MTO regime. As submitted by the Prosecution, s 337 of the CPC sets out qualifying conditions to be met under the requirements for community-based sentencing, of which an MTO is a specific type or sub-category. These exclude, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, offences for which the sentence is fixed by law,<span class="font-italic"> </span>offences for which a specified minimum or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment is prescribed by law, and offences punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds three years (thus excluding offences which would involve the possible application of Exception 7 of the PC or s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA). Overall, it is clear which offenders fall within or outside of these provisions; there is also no issue of illogicality or incoherence since these requirements limit community-based sentences to offences which are less serious or harmful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Limb (b) of the “reasonable classification” test then enquires into whether that differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute. The relevant standard of rationality is arbitrariness (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Taw Cheng </span><span class="font-italic">Kong </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 at [80]; <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong </span>at [111]) and the requisite rational relation will more often than not be found, as there is “no need for a perfect relation or ‘complete coincidence’ between the differentia in question and the purpose and object of the statute concerned” [emphasis in original omitted] (<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng Suang </span>at [68]). As described at [24] above, the purpose and object of the MTO regime is to target persons with specific and minor mental conditions where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing principle. It was intended that the offender who receives focused treatment under an MTO would remain in the community, and generally receive treatment from the IMH.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Given this backdrop, the differentia would have a rational relation to the objectives of the MTO regime. Offenders who meet the conditions for community-based sentencing would accordingly need to meet the requirements in s 339 for an MTO, including a favourable MTO suitability report, the substance of which there is limited scope for review. This is on the basis that the IMH, which generally administers treatment under an MTO, ought not be compelled to treat those whom it believes do not have a treatable mental condition or are unsuitable for treatment, as noted at [16] above. It is therefore not arbitrary that there should be no questioning of the decision of the appointed psychiatrist as regards whether the criteria in s 339(3) of the CPC have been met in respect of an offender. At the same time, given the overall purpose of the MTO as an alternative sentencing regime, it stands to reason that an offender’s psychiatric condition should be ascertained as having contributed to his offending, and the appointed psychiatrist is best placed to so ascertain. On the other hand, for offenders who do not meet the conditions for community-based sentencing, the question of an appointed psychiatrist’s determination vis-à-vis an offender meeting the requirements in s 339(3) for an MTO simply does not arise. As pointed out by the Prosecution, there is then no issue of medical ethics and the court, in considering the remaining sentencing options, assumes its role as the ultimate fact-finder on the relevance of an offender’s psychiatric condition.

</div> In oral submissions, while he maintained the argument on the unconstitutionality of the MTO Provisions, he took the view that it was not the whole MTO regime that was at risk. Rather, the contravention of s 339(8) of the CPC was problematic in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 This appears to be an argument for the operation of the doctrine of severability, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the severance of an unconstitutional portion of the law while retaining the remaining statute, which is based on Art 4 of the Constitution. Although the doctrine applies in the event that it is impossible to construe a modification into an unconstitutional law under Art 162 of the Constitution, Art 162, which falls under Part XIV of the Constitution titled “Transitional Provisions”, only applies in respect of “an existing law or a law which had already been enacted but not yet brought into force at the commencement of the Constitution” (<span class="font-italic">Prab</span><span class="font-italic">agaran </span>at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General </span>[2012] 4 SLR 476 at [58]–[59]). As such, it is not applicable in respect of the MTO Provisions, which were introduced in 2010 (see [24] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Due to the conclusion reached above that the MTO Provisions do not violate Arts 12(1) or 93 of the Constitution, it is not strictly necessary to consider the operation of the doctrine of severability in the circumstances. In any event, even if I were with the Appellant on his arguments on the unconstitutionality of these provisions, I do not think severability would have been possible. In approaching the question of severability, “legislative intent is paramount”, and the focus in such an exercise is “the effect of such excisions on the operation of the Act as a whole … it must be shown to be Parliament’s intention behind the enactment of an Act that is found to be partially in breach of the Constitution that it should nevertheless continue to be given effect even after the severance and invalidity of some portions” (<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>at [36]–[37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The legislative intention behind the CPC amendments introducing the MTO and community-based sentencing regime, and the rationale for the MTO Provisions in particular, have been canvassed at [16] and [24] above. Ms Rajah had, on another occasion, addressed a question from Mr Pillai on offenders with mental disorders who are not assessed as suitable for an MTO, but who could nevertheless benefit from treatment (Matter Raised on Adjournment Motion on Community Sentencing and Other Rehabilitative Options, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(11 September 2017) vol 94): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Community-Based Sentencing (CBS) scheme was introduced in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) in 2010 to harness the resources of the community in rehabilitating offenders … We can go further, and intend to do so … For offenders with mental health conditions in particular, we are proposing to expand the range of offences that are eligible for MTOs. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, we must take a balanced approach. Not all cases are suitable for Community-Based Sentencing. Some crimes may be too serious, and it would not serve the justice system well to allow the offenders to be on the CBS regime. Some offenders may not benefit from CBS. Hence, the regime has to be carefully calibrated. We will need to draw a line somewhere, even if that means that some will fall outside the regime …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[On Mr Pillai’s point on] the availability of treatment for offenders whose mental health conditions have been clinically assessed as being not susceptible to treatment[,] [t]here are good reasons why these offenders are not given MTOs. It would pose a danger to the public and undermine confidence in our criminal justice system if offenders who would otherwise be imprisoned are allowed to remain in the community, even though there is no prospect that the underlying cause of their offending can be addressed through medical treatment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The effect of the Appellant’s constitutional challenge would be that, if successful, s 339(4) (which precludes the court from granting an MTO in the face of an unfavourable MTO suitability report) and s 339(9) (which provides that an MTO suitability report is final and conclusive on the matters in s 339(3)) would be excised, along with possibly s 339(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) (which provides the criteria of the offender’s psychiatric condition as a contributing factor for his offending, to be stated by the appointed psychiatrist in the report). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, such an excision cannot be sustained. The intent of the amendments introducing community-based sentencing generally and the MTO regime in particular was to harness community resources in addressing the underlying cause of an offender’s criminal behaviour. It would be contrary to such an intention should the inquiry under s 339(3) not be for the sole professional judgment of the appointed psychiatrist, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, should the court nevertheless impose an MTO even if the appointed psychiatrist does not find an offender suitable; or further review the merits of the psychiatrist’s determination of these matters. In such a situation, it would be difficult for community resources (in particular, the IMH) to be successfully targeted towards rehabilitating an offender. It would also undermine the purpose of such an MTO as the offender would then possibly be a danger to the community, compromising as well public confidence in the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consequences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, however, it was correctly argued by the Appellant that one of the requirements of s 339 of the CPC, specifically s 339(8), does not appear to have been facially complied with. As noted at [9] above, this provides that before making an MTO suitability report, an appointed psychiatrist “shall take into consideration the report made by the psychiatrist engaged by the offender”. It is read in light of s 339(7) of the CPC, which provides that an offender may, within three weeks from the date the court calls for an MTO suitability report or “such other time as the court may allow, submit to the appointed psychiatrist any report made by a psychiatrist engaged by the offender”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Appellant argues that although the Appellant’s Reports were forwarded to the IMH on 26 February 2021 pursuant to the court’s request for an MTO suitability report in respect of the Appellant, the Psychiatrist made no mention of the Appellant’s Reports in stating the materials relied on for the MTO Suitability Report. This apparent breach of s 339(8) of the CPC is an additional ground for the court to convene a Newton hearing in respect of the MTO Suitability Report.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Prosecution submits that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>indicates that the opinion of an appointed psychiatrist should only be questioned in cases where, for example, the report is unclear or “draws manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions” (<span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>at [11]). Furthermore, it submits that a Newton hearing should “generally be a measure of last resort” (<span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>at [12]). Rather, the court should clarify with the Psychiatrist as to whether she considered the Appellant’s Reports. If she had indeed neglected this, it would not be too late for her to do so, and clarify whether she would have arrived at a different opinion in the MTO Suitability Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Sections 339(7) and (8) of the CPC indicate that the appointed psychiatrist must consider any submission by the offender of a report made by his psychiatrist. Though these were not in fact submitted by the Appellant, but rather provided by the court, nothing to my mind turns on this difference: the reports were available to the appointed psychiatrist and should have been considered before finally determining the matters in s 339(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As noted at [40] above, it remains open to the court to further enquire or seek clarification from the appointed psychiatrist, where there may be issues of obvious clerical errors leading to an erroneous report, or issues of “manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions” (<span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong </span>at [11]).  Moreover, I do not read s 339(9) of the CPC as precluding any curative action whether or not the non-compliance is substantive. The conclusive nature expressed as regards the appointed psychiatrist’s opinion in s 339(9) is only as to the substantive conclusions in an MTO suitability report; it does not exclude the possibility that the report is wanting in some way. If anything, the various requirements in s 339, specifically s 339(8), operate as conditions precedent to the psychiatrist’s opinion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 While the requirement in s 339(8) is a precondition to a finding by the court that there is an MTO suitability report for the purposes of s 339, it does not follow that the report must be rejected out of hand if there is failure to strictly comply. Doing so would be disproportionate where there may have been a clerical error or omission. What should be obtained is an explanation from the appointed psychiatrist. The court may then consider whether in the circumstances a correction should be permitted. As noted by See JC in <span class="font-italic">Low Gek Hong</span>, “satellite litigation aimed at challenging or re-interpreting what the psychiatrist has stated, or not stated” should be avoided in order to avoid unnecessary protraction of the sentencing process (at [16]). This, in his view, was the purpose of s 339(9) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Given that there needs to be further clarification on whether the precondition in s 339(8) of the CPC has been met, the court cannot impose an MTO at this stage. Section 339 of the CPC does not provide that the opinion of another psychiatrist can be substituted or considered in the event of non-compliance by the appointed psychiatrist. According to the structure of the section, in particular ss 339(1)–(4), a favourable report by an appointed psychiatrist is required before the court may impose an MTO. If the court has doubts concerning the sufficiency of an MTO suitability report, the alternative sentence of an MTO is simply not available, and the offender must then be dealt with under the general sentencing regime.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The next steps</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In light of the apparent non-compliance with s 339(8) of the CPC, the opportunity will be given for the appointed psychiatrist to explain what had happened, and whether there is any change to her conclusions. The court will then consider whether the custodial sentence imposed by the District Judge in the present case ought to be upheld.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ravi s/o Madasamy (K K Cheng Law LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Zu Zhao and Niranjan Ranjakunalan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent. </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
