OF DECISION</strong></font>
<font face="CG Times" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The plaintiff is a company incorporated in 1972. It was the

developer of a condominium and bungalow housing project at Tanglin Hill – Ridley

Park. The project was known as the "Tanglin Hill Project". One of the

plaintiff’s directors, Ang Poon Soon, was in charge of the project. He was the person

who made all the important decisions. One of the decisions he made on the plaintiff’s

behalf was to lend large sums of money (between November 1996 and May 1998) amounting to

$1,400,000. The loans were made by cash cheques drawn on the plaintiff’s account and

received by one Lee Chin Kian. The cheques were all paid into the account of a company

called Articon Construction Pte Ltd ("Articon") of which Lee was a director and

shareholder. Payments were made from time to time, and the balance unpaid is $500,000.

This was the sum that the plaintiff claimed in this suit against the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The big question, and the sole issue in this suit was, who was the

borrower? It was not disputed that the agreement for the loans was made orally between Ang

Poon Soon and Lee Chin Kian. Neither was it disputed that Ang and Lee were close friends.

Lee was once the tutor in Chinese to Ang. The plaintiff’s case was that Lee Chin Kian

borrowed the money on the defendant’s behalf. The defendant is a construction

company. It entered into a construction contract with the plaintiff as the main contractor

for the Tanglin Hill development. However, it assigned the entire contract to Articon. Lee

was neither a shareholder or director of the defendant company. The defendant company held

a 35% shareholding in Articon. The defendant claimed that the sub-contract it signed with

Articon was made with the knowledge and consent of Ang Poon Soon. The sub-contract was

indeed proved in evidence and was not disputed at trial; but the plaintiff’s

witnesses say that they had no knowledge of that contract at the material time.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It was also not disputed that the defendant’s witnesses Phay Gi

Mo and his nephew Pey Ciew Chang, were authorised signatories to Articon’s cheques.

The other signatory was Lee Chin Kian. Pey Ciew Chang had about 16.6% of Articon’s

shareholding, while Lee Chin Kian owned 26.6%, Kwek Teng Pheow owned 21.3%, and the

defendant 35.3%. Lee Chin Kian is the brother-in-law of Phay Gi Mo, who is a director of

the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It is obvious that direct evidence of the contract of loan could

only be adduced by Ang Poon Soon or Lee Chin Kian. Ang is dead (he died in 1998), and Lee

was not called by either party as a witness. He was also not a party to the suit whether

as a defendant or a third party. Articon had been wound up. It was not disputed that the

loans were made by way of cash cheques issued by Ang Poon Soon on behalf of the plaintiff.

The cheques were handed over to Lee Chin Kian who deposited the cheques into

Articon’s account. Some of the receipts for the cheques from the plaintiff were

issued by the defendant and marked as "Advance in payment to the Tanglin Hill

project" (sic). There was also no dispute that the general ledger of Articon recorded

the payments as loans made to it by the plaintiff. Partial payments were made from time to

time by Articon. However, the plaintiff relied on an audit confirmation dated 23 January

1998, signed by Phay Gi Mo, acknowledging that the defendant owes the plaintiff a sum of

$300,000. A subsequent confirmation note for $500,000 was not signed. Phay Gi Mo explained

that he initially declined to sign the audit confirmation because the defendant had

already sub-contracted the construction work to Articon, but Kwek Teng Pheow, a director

of Articon, assured him that it was of no major significance as the letter was only a

formality. He was further assured by Kwek that the plaintiff had a retention sum of more

than $500,000 which was sufficient to set-off the $300,000 stated in the audit

confirmation if necessary. Mr. Phay did not make it clear, but my impression from his

evidence was that he was thus assured that the defendant was not at risk by his signature.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Pey Ciew Chang averred that with the assistance of Ang Poon Soon,

Articon obtained credit facilities of up to $4.9m from the Overseas Union Bank for the

purposes of the project. The facilities were secured only by the personal guarantees of

Articon’s shareholders. The defendant on its part, executed an assignment, in the

bank’s favour, of all money due to it from the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The legal burden of proving the cause of action lies with the

plaintiff. In the course of a trial, evidence adduced by one party may require a rebuttal

from the opposing party. One such instance in this case was the evidence of the audit

confirmation signed by Phay Gi Mo. Mr. Yang Ing Loong for the plaintiff made a strong

submission on this point, relying on <i>Gobind Lalwani v Basco Enterprises Pte Ltd <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 354</nobr></i>. In that case, the company signed an audit letter acknowledging a debt to

the plaintiff who was one of its shareholders. The court found for the plaintiff. Chao

Hick Tin J (as he then was) held, at p359 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I cannot see how, when the audit confirmation letter clearly

  stated that the sum is due to the plaintiff, it can reasonably be argued that no debt is

  due and owing to the plaintiff. And if a sum is due and owing, it is payable, unless there

  is evidence of a special contractual arrangement for deferring payment or an agreement for

  other methods of payment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7. By itself, the written confirmation is strong <i>prima facie</i>

evidence of debt. It required an explanation. This was provided by Mr. Phay, whose

evidence and explanation I accept. Basco’s case concerned a claim for an account

stated on the basis of the audit confirmation letter alone. That case was not complicated

by other factors so far as the effect of the audit confirmation letter was concerned. The

facts in this case were distinctly different. There was an outright dispute as to who the

contracting parties were. The possibility of a third and even fourth party being the

borrower in this case significantly altered the context of the claim. A straightforward

approach towards the audit confirmation letter cannot be taken in this case without due

consideration to other evidence which suggests that it might perhaps be Articon or Lee

himself who was the borrower.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The evidence which indicated that the loan could have been made to

either Lee Chin Kian or Articon was ample. Significantly, the benefit of the money loaned

went to Articon. Articon assumed the responsibility of payment and did make periodic

payments. The main contract was sub-contracted by the defendant to Articon. This was also

material even though the plaintiff witnesses claimed that the plaintiff was not aware of

the sub-contract. I am of the view (given the closeness of the relationship between

several of the personalities in the plaintiff, the defendant, and Articon) that this was

improbable. Nonetheless, the plaintiff’s knowledge on this point was not crucial.

What was crucial was the fact that by reason of the sub-contract the defendant’s

benefits, liabilities, and its responsibilities under the contract with the plaintiff were

vastly diminished. It seems more probable that the loan was requested by Lee Chin Kian on

behalf of Articon. The loan effectively benefited Articon, and indirectly Lee himself.

There was hardly any evidence that the defendant benefited from them. In my view, there is

no significant inference to be drawn from the fact that Lee had signed contracts on behalf

of the defendants and had attended site meetings as the defendant’s representative.

This evidence must be considered against all the others pieces of evidence, some of which

were favourable and others contradictory to the plaintiff’s case. The personalities

involved were close friends and that was borne out by the evidence that Lee was the

brother-in-law of Phay Gi Mo; Kwek Teng Peow, a director of Articon was previously an

employee of the defendant; the defendant and Pei Ciew Chang together owned a total of 52%

of the shares in Articon; Phay Gi Mo himself was a cheque signatory of Articon; and Lee

and Ang were at all material times the principal decision makers. The fact that Lee had a

say in both Articon and the defendant only intensified the burden on the plaintiff (to

show that he acted on behalf of the defendant). The plaintiff’s basic burden was

still to prove that the borrower was probably the defendant; but in the absence of direct

evidence, the indirect evidence proved contradictory and inadequate.</p>
<p align="justify">9. I should add that the plaintiff was not without a remedy in the

circumstances. It could have sued Lee Chin Kian and/or Articon. The practical difficulties

in the way of an action against Lee or Articon do not detract from the reality of the

situation, namely, that the defendant was not a contracting party. It should not be

pursued merely because Articon had become impecunious and Lee Chin Kian cannot be found.</p>
<p align="justify">10. Thus, on the evidence before me, I am unable to say that the

plaintiff has proved on a balance of probabilities that the loans were made to the

defendant. The claim was, therefore, dismissed with costs.</p>
