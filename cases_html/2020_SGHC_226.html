The present dispute concerned the use and sale of the partnership asset, a vessel known as the MV <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> (“the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>”), post-dissolution and the final partnership accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> was registered in the name of the 3rd defendant, Vessel Offshore Management Pte Ltd, which was owned by the 1st and 2nd defendants. Before the partnership was dissolved, the 3rd defendant managed the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>for the partnership and chartered it out on behalf of the partnership. After the partnership was dissolved, the 1st and 2nd defendants retained control of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>and essentially carried on chartering out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>through the 3rd defendant, as it had done before the partnership was dissolved. Eventually, the 1st and 2nd defendants sold the vessel in September 2017 for USD790,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I found that the 1st and 2nd defendants were not entitled to continue operating the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>as a business post-dissolution. I also found that in failing to accept an offer of USD1.2m that was made for the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>in September 2014, the 1st and 2nd defendants had breached their duty to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> as soon as they reasonably could, in order to wind up the affairs of the partnership. I gave certain directions with respect to the finalisation of the partnership accounts, finding ultimately that the amount due to the plaintiffs was US$387,429.67. Finally, I dismissed the 3rd defendant’s counterclaim for the plaintiffs’ share of management fees and expenses for the period between 1 September 2017 and 30 November 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants have appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The 3rd defendant was incorporated in January 2010. At all material times, the 1st and 2nd defendants were the only directors and shareholders of the 3rd defendant. The 3rd defendant’s main business was the provision of ship management and chartering services, and security consultancy services including the provision of armed personnel for the protection of commercial shipping and anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and East Africa. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The 3rd defendant acquired two escort vessels; one of these two vessels was the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 1 August 2010, the plaintiffs and the 1st and 2nd defendants entered into a Vessel Partnership Agreement in respect of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>(“the Agreement”).

</div> The plaintiffs’ share in the partnership was 40% and the 1st and 2nd defendants held the remaining 60% share. It was common ground that the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>was beneficially owned by the partnership at all material times. The business of the partnership was to charter out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>for profit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The partnership agreement was a simple one-page document and it was not disputed that the agreement was also governed by oral terms.

The 3rd defendant charged a fee for doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The 3rd defendant offered the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> (on behalf of the partnership) to its customers for charter.

The plaintiffs claimed that the 1st and 2nd defendants were not entitled to continue with the business of chartering out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> after the dissolution of the partnership and that the partnership accounts should exclude the profit and loss relating to the post-dissolution charters. According to the plaintiffs, the 1st and 2nd defendants could have sold the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>in September 2014 for US$1.2m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The 1st and 2nd defendants denied any breach of duties. They claimed that no firm offer to purchase the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> was received until July 2017 and that the sale of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>for US$790,000 in September 2017 was at the best price obtainable.  The 1st and 2nd defendants also claimed that they had the obligation to continue to charter out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> until it was sold. Accordingly, they claimed that the 3rd Accounts (which included the profit and loss arising from the operations of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>post-dissolution) were correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As the 3rd Accounts were drawn up to 31 August 2017, the 3rd defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for the plaintiffs’ 40% share of the management fee and expenses for the period between 1 September 2017 and 30 November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In their respective defences, the defendants also claimed that the plaintiffs had accepted the cheque for US$161,661.92, which was issued on the basis that acceptance of the cheque would be in full and final settlement of the plaintiffs’ share in the partnership (see [18] above).

Therefore, the 1st and 2nd defendants had no authority to bind the partnership to the post-dissolution charters of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>. It followed that the revenue and expenses relating to the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>’s post-dissolution charters ought not to be included in the partnership accounts. The plaintiffs pointed out that the 1st and 2nd defendants’ authority to bind the partnership post-dissolution was limited under s 38 of the Partnership Act (Cap 391, 1994 Rev Ed) which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Continuing authority of partners for the purposes of winding up</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">38.</span>  After the dissolution of a partnership, the authority of each partner to bind the firm, and the other rights and obligations of the partners, continue notwithstanding the dissolution so far as may be necessary to wind up the affairs of the partnership, and to complete transactions begun but unfinished at the time of the dissolution, but not otherwise:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Provided that the firm is in no case bound by the acts of a partner who has become bankrupt; but this proviso does not affect the liability of any person who has after the bankruptcy represented himself or knowingly suffered himself to be represented as a partner of the bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There were no transactions that had been begun but which were unfinished at the time of the dissolution.

</div>
</div> However, this was not the defendants’ pleaded case. In any event, in my view, it was clear that the post-dissolution charters were not necessary for purposes of winding up the affairs of the partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The defendants referred to <span class="font-italic">Cragg v Ford </span>[1842] 1 Y &amp; C Ch Cas 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Cragg</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Boghani v Nathoo</span> [2012] Bus LR 429 (“<span class="font-italic">Boghani</span>”) in support of their argument. It was not clear from the defendants’ submissions how these two cases helped their case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Cragg</span>, the plaintiff and defendant were partners. Upon dissolution of the partnership, the defendant undertook the duty of winding up its affairs. The partnership incurred a loss due to the defendant’s decision to delay the sale of some cotton, which belonged to the partnership at the time of its dissolution. The court held that the loss was chargeable to the partnership because the defendant had made the decision to delay the sale in honest exercise of his judgment and the plaintiff could himself have sold the cotton. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Boghani</span>, the partnership carried on the business of hotel development. At the date of the dissolution, the partnership assets included two uncompleted hotel developments. The court held that the completion of the uncompleted developments was not necessary in order to wind up the partnership and ordered the sale of the developments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, neither <span class="font-italic">Cragg </span>nor <span class="font-italic">Boghani </span>assisted the defendants. In <span class="font-italic">Cragg</span>, the defendant was clearly authorised to sell the cotton for the purposes of winding up the affairs of the partnership.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In the present case, the 1st and 2nd defendants had no authority to enter into the post-dissolution charters on behalf of the partnership because they were clearly not necessary for the purposes of winding up the affairs of the partnership. As for <span class="font-italic">Borghani</span>, in fact, that case is against the 1st and 2nd defendants. In <span class="font-italic">Borghani</span>, the Court rejected the defendant’s contention that the developments should be completed and then sold. Instead, the Court ordered the developments to be sold because completing the developments was not necessary in order to wind up the partnership. Likewise, in the present case, the post-dissolution charters were not necessary in order to wind up the partnership. The <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>should have been sold instead of being chartered out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, it was not disputed that there was no express consent from the plaintiffs to the 1st and 2nd defendants continuing to operate the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> as a business post-dissolution. However, the defendants submitted during oral closing submissions that the plaintiffs knew that the defendants were continuing to operate the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> as a business post-dissolution and had not objected to the same. The defendants also submitted that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming any breach of duty.

</div> However, the defendants had not pleaded acquiescence or estoppel as a defence and were therefore not entitled to raise these in closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, the defendants submitted that it was reasonable to infer an implied term that each party would continue post-dissolution to act in the best interest of the partnership to preserve the value of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> and prevent further loss to the partnership pending the sale of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>.

</div> On this basis, the defendants argued that they were required to accept gainful employment for the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> so long as they believed it to be in the best interest of the partnership to do so. I rejected the defendants’ submission. It was again not the defendants’ pleaded case. Further, I saw no reason why such a term should be implied. Dissolution of the partnership meant that the business of the partnership ceased. It did not make sense to imply a term which permitted the business of the partnership to be continued, post dissolution. This would have defeated the purpose of dissolving the partnership in the very first place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Fourth, the defendants submitted that they owed a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss that the partnership had already incurred as of the date of dissolution.

</div> Once again, this had not been pleaded. In any event, this too would have defeated the purpose of dissolving the partnership. Obviously, there was no certainty that doing so would have been profitable. In fact, the partnership had suffered a net loss of US$160,250.39 for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2013 (see [15] above). In my view, the 1st and 2nd defendants had neither the duty nor the authority to continue to expose the partnership to the risks of carrying on the business post-dissolution, without the plaintiffs’ agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 What then was the defendants’ pleaded case? The 1st and 2nd defendants pleaded that notwithstanding the cessation of the partnership business, the plaintiffs and the 1st and 2nd defendants continued to “have obligations vis-à-vis each other <span class="font-italic">qua</span> co-owners” and that the 3rd defendant would “continue to manage and operate the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>” until it was sold.

They had no authority to bind the partnership to the post-dissolution charters of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>. The revenue and expenses relating the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>’s post-dissolution charters could not therefore be included in the partnership accounts.

</div> The Bill of Sale was signed on 31 August 2017. The vessel was finally delivered to MOL on 1 November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The plaintiffs submitted that the 1st and 2nd defendants did not make any efforts to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>within a reasonable time after dissolution and instead chose to carry on the business of the partnership despite the dissolution. In response, the defendants submitted that the sale of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> for US$790,000 in 2017 was at the best price obtainable in the circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was clear that the 1st and 2nd defendants undertook the duty to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>and wind up the affairs of the partnership. The <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>remained under their control post-dissolution. Also, they were the ones who engaged the services of JHA to sell the vessel, and the services of TKNP to draw up the partnership accounts. In my view, they were under a duty to  sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>as soon as they reasonably could, in order to wind up the affairs of the partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I found that in failing to accept the offer of US$1.2m that was made in September 2014 (see [40] above), the 1st and 2nd defendants breached their duty to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>in order that the affairs of the partnership could be wound up. The <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> was valued at US$845,000 in January 2014. There was no reason for the 1st and 2nd defendants not to accept the offer of US$1.2m. They did not even attempt to negotiate. Instead, they insisted (in my view, unreasonably) on selling at a price closer to US$1.8m. The 1st and 2nd defendants did not consult the plaintiffs before they decided not to accept the offer. The 1st and 2nd defendants did not give any credible reason for not accepting the offer of US$1.2m or for insisting on a price of $1.8m. There was nothing in the evidence that suggested that the sale would not have gone through if the 1st and 2nd defendants had accepted the offer of US$1.2m. The potential buyer’s identity was known and the offer had been made without any other conditions. Further, as the plaintiffs submitted,  the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> was marketable but for the out-of-market pricing by the 1st and 2nd defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, the evidence showed that the 1st and 2nd defendants had insisted on a price of US$1.8m and were not keen to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> at US$1.2m because they believed that they could earn more by continuing to charter out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>. It was true that the 1st and 2nd defendants bore a 60% risk of these charters and that they did not intend to make a loss by continuing with the charters. Nevertheless, the fact remained that having agreed to dissolve the partnership and to sell the vessel, it was not open to them to continue with the charters without the plaintiffs’ agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, by continuing to charter out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>, the 1st and 2nd defendants also stood to gain through the 3rd defendant.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The 1st and 2nd defendants purported to engage the 3rd defendant to continue managing the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>. The 3rd defendant charged management fees to the partnership. In addition, the 3rd defendant had the opportunity to provide security services when the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> was chartered out. Between January 2014 and October 2016, the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka </span>was chartered out seven times; the 3rd defendant provided security services in five of the charters. By continuing to charter out the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span>, the 1st and 2nd defendants were able to earn revenue for themselves through the 3rd defendant, at the plaintiffs’ expense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, based on the evidence, the inference was strong that the 1st and 2nd defendants finally decided to sell the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> in 2017 because there was no demand for charters of the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> and the market value of the vessel had fallen drastically. Also, as it turned out, between 2014 and 2016, the <span class="font-italic">Ngati Haka</span> in fact suffered operating losses every year.
