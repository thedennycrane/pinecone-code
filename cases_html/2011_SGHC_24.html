<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the applicant, Mr Yap
                    Sing Lee, under s 98 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act
                    (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”) against certain orders
                    made by the Strata Titles Board (“STB”) on 10 June 2010 in
                    STB No 69 of 2009, which concerned Mr Yap’s attempts to compel the
                    respondent, the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan (“MSCT”)
                    No 1267 of the development known as “Yong An Park” (“the
                    respondent”), to disclose certain information and documents to him under
                    s 47 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 19 October 2010, after hearing the
                    parties, I dismissed Mr Yap’s appeal. Mr Yap has now appealed
                    against my judgment, and I therefore provide the grounds of my decision. I
                    should add that, during the hearing, Mr Yap informed me that, although he
                    was representing himself, he had in fact sought and received legal assistance in
                    the preparation of the appeal before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Yap was the subsidiary proprietor
                    (“SP”) of a penthouse unit in Yong An Park, and, as the STB noted
                    in [4] of its grounds of decision (“GD”), has had “a number
                    of differences” with the respondent, including the latter’s refusal
                    or omission to approve Mr Yap’s proposal to carry out alterations and
                    additions to the roof terrace of his penthouse, as well as over certain other
                    alterations made by Mr Yap. In [37] of his written submissions, Mr Yap
                    seemed to disagree with the STB’s assessment of his relationship with the
                    respondent, but as Mr Yap himself had, at [8] of his written submissions,
                    chronicled a long list of conflicts between him and the respondent, it was not
                    clear to me that the STB’s assessment was objectionable in any significant
                    way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Two other SPs of Yong An Park, one Ponda and one
                    Karim, had also carried out similar alterations and additions to their penthouse
                    units, and the respondent had in fact commenced legal proceedings against Ponda
                    on 10 August 2006, although these proceedings were subsequently
                    discontinued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Arising out of these differences, Mr Yap
                    made a number of applications under s 47 of the BMSMA to inspect a wide
                    range of documents, including minutes of the meetings of the Council and Legal
                    Sub-Committee of the respondent, and correspondence between the respondent and
                    its lawyers. Section 47, so far as relevant, provides:</p>

                            specified, being a date not later than 21 days after the receipt of the

                            inspection referred to in that subsection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As these documents were not forthcoming,
                    Mr Yap eventually filed STB No 69 of 2009 before the STB, seeking,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the respondent
                    supply the information or documents sought by him, under s 113 read with
                    s 101 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the hearing before the STB, in the course of
                    the cross-examination of Mr Yap on the first day of the hearing, it
                    transpired that the respondent was willing to allow Mr Yap to inspect all
                    the documents requested, save for a few documents in respect of which legal
                    professional privilege (“LPP”) was being claimed. Consequently,
                    Mr Yap and the respondent were able to agree that the STB needed only to
                    determine whether to order the inspection of the remaining four items for which
                    LPP was being claimed, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The redacted portion of the Council
                        minutes of the 4<sup>th</sup> Council Meeting held on 15
                        September 2009 (“item (a)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The redacted portion of the Council minutes of
                        the 5<sup>th</sup> Council Meeting held on 27 October 2009
                        (“item (b)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The redacted portion of the recommendations of the Legal
                        Sub-Committee referred to in the draft Council minutes of the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Council Meeting held on 21 July 2009
                        (“item (c)”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     The legal advice given to the respondent by its lawyers on
                        the respondent’s claims or potential claims against Ponda, Karim and
                        Mr Yap (“item (d)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The hearing was then adjourned to enable
                    Mr Yap and the respondent to submit their written arguments and address the
                    STB on their submissions. According to [8] of the STB’s GD, although
                    Mr Yap, in his reply submissions, claimed that he never withdrew any of the
                    original orders sought by him, he conceded during his oral submissions that he
                    had agreed that the STB need only determine the four remaining items above, and
                    the resumed hearing proceeded on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The arguments before the STB therefore centred
                    on whether a MCST was entitled to assert LPP against a SP, and, after
                    considering the parties’ submissions, the STB gave an affirmative answer.
                    Consequently, it determined that items (a) and (d) at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above were covered by LPP and could not be disclosed to
                    Mr Yap. In respect of item (b), however, the STB held that the respondent
                    was not entitled to claim LPP as item (b) merely reported information and
                    recorded instructions to the managing agent of Yong An Park, and therefore had
                    to be disclosed to Mr Yap. For the same reasons, the STB held that
                    substantially the whole of item (c) was also not privileged from disclosure,
                    save for the eight words after “not to further pursue the legal suit with
                    Mr Ponda”, which were subject to LPP. The STB also ordered that
                    parties were to bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Yap appealed the STB’s decision
                    (insofar as it related to items (a) and (d), as well as the eight redacted words
                    in item (c)), contending that it should be set aside for various reasons (which
                    also formed the issues for my determination), <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The STB erred in law in holding that
                        a MCST is entitled to assert LPP against a SP;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The STB erred in law by breaching the rules of
                        natural justice; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The STB erred in law in ordering parties to bear their own
                        costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature of an appeal from the STB to the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The right of appeal against an order of the
                    STB to the High Court is provided for in s 98 of the BMSMA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Eng Ghee and others v

                        (“<em>Edwards v Bairstow</em>”) that (at

                    appeal under s 98 of the BMSMA) might also occur where the facts as found
                    could not possibly justify the legal conclusion reached, and where the only
                    inference had to be that “there has been some misconception of the law
                    and that, this has been responsible for the determination” (<em>Edwards v Bairstow</em> at 36).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Legal professional privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Yap’s first ground of appeal,
                    that a MCST was not entitled to assert LPP against a SP, was undoubtedly an
                    appeal “on a point of law” within the meaning of s 98 of the
                    BMSMA, and was the key issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although the STB had held that a MCST could
                    assert LPP against a SP’s request for information under s 47 of the
                    BMSMA, it became apparent during the hearing before me that the true dispute was
                    on a narrower point, <em>viz</em>, whether a MCST could
                    assert <em>legal advice privilege</em> against a SP under
                    s 47. Consequently, I did not consider it necessary to decide whether
                        <em>litigation privilege</em> could be asserted by a
                    MCST against a SP under s 47.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicability of legal advice privilege </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     LPP was exhaustively analysed by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore
                        Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 367 (“<em>Skandinaviska</em>”), where the Court of Appeal stated (at [27])
                    that LPP was a statutory right enacted in ss 128 and 131 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), and that these two
                    sections covered both species of LPP, <em>viz</em>, legal
                    advice privilege and litigation privilege. However, the EA was not applicable in
                    the present case, as s 2(1) of the EA provides that “Parts I, II and
                    III shall apply to all judicial proceedings in or before any
                    court…” (see also J Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the
                        Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Ed, 2010), para 14.115, at footnote 311). Although it was possible to interpret
                    s 2(1) in a non-exclusive fashion, <em>ie</em>, that
                    Part III of the EA (where ss 128 and 131 are located) could be applied in
                    non-judicial proceedings as well as judicial proceedings (albeit that its
                    application was mandatory in the latter), s 128 of the EA was nonetheless
                    inapplicable since there was no question of <em>an advocate or
                        solicitor</em> being compelled to disclose privileged information, and
                    s 131 of the EA was also inapplicable since it contemplated a person being
                    compelled to disclose confidential communication between him and his legal
                    professional adviser <em>to the court</em>, which was not
                    the case here, where Mr Yap’s argument was that the MCST was
                    compelled by s 47 of the BMSMA to produce privileged documents <em>to him</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Consequently, the provisions of the EA were
                    inapplicable, and recourse had to be had to the common law rules regarding legal
                    advice privilege. At common law, legal advice privilege, as part of LPP, is not
                    (or more accurately, no longer (see C Tapper, <em>Cross &amp;
                        Tapper on Evidence</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        12<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010) (“<em>Cross
                        &amp; Tapper</em>”) at pp 436 to 437)) regarded as merely a
                    rule of evidence, restricted to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, but is
                    now considered a substantive legal right that may be claimed outside these areas
                    (see <em>Phipson on Evidence</em> (Hodge M Malek gen ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2010)
                        (“<em>Phipson</em>”) at paras 23-02 to
                    23-06). Given that some of the landmark cases espousing the latter view
                        (<em>eg</em>, <em>Regina v Derby
                        Magistrates’ Court, ex parte B</em> [1996] 1 AC 487
                    and <em>Baker v Campbell</em> (1983) 153 CLR 52)
                    received the express approval of the Court of Appeal in <em>Skandinaviska</em> (at [24] and [25]), it followed that legal advice
                    privilege was applicable, notwithstanding that no judicial or quasi-judicial
                    proceedings were in issue when Mr Yap sought production of the relevant
                    documents under s 47 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Yap’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mr Yap advanced a number of arguments in
                    support of his submission on the issue of whether a MCST could assert legal
                    advice privilege against a SP, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The decision of the Court of Appeal
                        in <em>Horizon Towers</em> (at [199]), that a
                        collective sale committee (“SC”) constituted under
                        s 84A(1A) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev
                        Ed) (“LTSA”) could not assert legal advice privilege against a
                        SP, was directly applicable;</p>

                            (“<em>The Estoril</em>”) correctly
                        established that a MCST could not resist a SP’s application for the
                        supply of information under s 47 of the BMSMA by claiming legal advice
                        privilege; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was a necessary implication from a purposive interpretation of the BMSMA
                        that the right of a SP to obtain information from a MCST under s 47 of
                        the BMSMA overrode legal advice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Yap also relied on the slightly
                    different argument that the STB had erred in giving a decision in favour of the
                    respondent despite the respondent’s failure to reveal to the STB the legal
                    advice in respect of which legal advice privilege was being
                claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I did not accept these
                arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Horizon Towers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first question to be addressed was whether
                    the respondent could avail itself of legal advice privilege at all. It was only
                    if the respondent could, <em>prima facie</em> at least,
                    claim legal advice privilege that one then had to consider the second question
                    of whether s 47 of the BMSMA excluded legal advice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Yap relied on <em>Horizon Towers</em> in submitting that a MCST could not, as against
                    its SPs, claim legal advice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     
          <em>Horizon Towers</em>
                    concerned a bitter dispute between minority and majority SPs regarding the
                    proposed collective sale of the development known as “Horizon
                    Towers”, which had been sanctioned by the STB (“the Horizon
                    Board”), but was eventually set aside by the Court of Appeal as a result
                    of the SC’s breaches of fiduciary duty as well as the errors of law
                    committed by the Horizon Board in the course of approving the collective
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the proceedings before the Horizon Board,
                    the minority objecting SPs of Horizon Towers had attempted to apply for the
                    legal advice given by the SC’s solicitors to be disclosed, but this was
                    rejected by the Horizon Board on the basis that the SC was entitled to claim
                    legal advice privilege in respect of the advice. The Court of Appeal criticised
                    this decision, stating (at [199]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>As for the granting of legal privilege, although
                                [the SC’s solicitors] purported to act only for the SC as
                                their principals, the SC had to represent the subsidiary proprietors
                                collectively. The SC was, after all, an agent for all the subsidiary
                                proprietors, and its solicitors were therefore sub-agents for all
                                the subsidiary proprietors. The objecting subsidiary proprietors
                                were entitled to know the contents of the legal advice and, indeed,
                                the SC was in breach of its duty of even-handedness by claiming
                                legal privilege in order to deny the objecting subsidiary
                                proprietors information which they were entitled to receive. The SC
                                was not, in the prevailing circumstances, entitled to rely on legal
                                privilege to justify its decision and at the same time refuse to
                                disclose the advice</em>.    [emphasis in
                            original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The crux of this reasoning was that the SC was
                    “an agent for all the subsidiary proprietors”, which was a theme
                    developed by the Court of Appeal in [104] and [105] of <em>Horizon Towers</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104    In our view, the SC
                            is the agent of the subsidiary proprietors collectively in relation to
                            the collective sale of their strata units. At the point when an SC is
                            appointed to carry out the collective sale (<em>inter
                                alia</em>, obtaining consent to the collective sale agreement;
                            advertising, negotiating and finalising the terms of the collective sale
                            with potential purchasers; and completing the sale), there is no
                            question of it being appointed to represent the consenting subsidiary
                            proprietors only, since at that point the process of signing up to the
                            collective sale agreement has not yet begun. The SC therefore carries
                            out the collective sale process on behalf of all the subsidiary
                            proprietors collectively and has the power to affect the legal relations
                            of all the subsidiary proprietors with third parties. The common law
                            requirement of express or implied assent by the principal… is not
                            relevant in the context of a statutory scheme, the very purpose of which
                            is to allow the sale of the strata development against the wishes of the
                            objecting subsidiary
                            proprietors.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As agent for the SPs, the SC in <em>Horizon Towers</em> was therefore not entitled to assert
                    legal advice privilege against its principal(s) (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), since, in an agency relationship, the
                    “privilege is the privilege of the principal” (<em>Phipson</em> at para 23-40).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Yap contended that, on analogy with
                    the agency relationship between a SC and all the SPs of a strata development
                    articulated in <em>Horizon Towers</em>, a MCST was
                    similarly the agent of all the SPs, and that this was reinforced by
                        s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BMSMA, which provides
                    that it shall be the duty of a MCST “to control, manage and administer

                    or unanimous resolutions, do certain things (such as execute transfers of common

<p class="Judg-1">Section 24(1)(<em>b</em>) of the BMSMA therefore made it abundantly clear that a MCST,
                    like an incorporated company, was to be regarded as a separate legal entity from
                    the corporators (in this case, SPs rather than shareholders) who comprised it.
                    In his oral submissions, Mr Yap contended that the analogy between a MCST
                    and an incorporated company was misconceived, because, <em>inter

                    the BMSMA. This contention was met by the high authority of <em>Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 418, where the Court of Appeal
                    described (at [9]) a MCST as an unlimited liability company (see also K S Teo,
                        <em>Strata Title in Singapore &amp; Malaysia</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) at p 199). Being an
                    unlimited liability company, it followed that a MCST was entitled to the rights
                    afforded by the law to a legal person, which rights included legal advice
                    privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Consequently, as a matter of authority,
                    Mr Yap’s reliance on <em>Horizon Towers</em> was
                    inapt. Unlike a MCST, a SC had no independent legal existence under the LTSA: in
                    a sense, the SC’s only legal quality was to “act jointly on behalf
                    of” the SPs as their agent, as required by s 84A(1A)(<em>a</em>) of the LTSA, and it was therefore no surprise that
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Horizon Towers</em> held that a
                    SC could not assert legal advice privilege as against the SPs, since any such
                    privilege could <em>only</em> belong to the SPs, for only
                    they had the capacity as legal persons to claim it. An SC would not therefore
                    have been able to claim legal advice privilege in its own right; any such
                    privilege being claimed by it would be claimed as agent for and on behalf of the
                    SPs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     That was not to say, however, that a MCST
                    could never be considered the agent of the SPs: the MCST and the SPs could enter
                    a consensual agency relationship, and the BMSMA clearly envisions that a MCST
                    may sometimes act as agent for its SPs (<em>eg</em>, under
                    s 86 of the BMSMA). However, simply because a MCST might for some purposes
                    have been regarded as an agent for the SPs did not mean that it was an agent for
                    them for all purposes. After all, it has been the law ever since <em>Aron Salomon (a pauper) v A Salomon and Company, Limited</em>
                    [1897] 1 AC 22 that a company is not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> an agent for its members, and I saw no reason why, in the
                    absence of statutory language demanding a different conclusion, the same
                    principle should not apply to the relationship between a MCST and its SPs, given
                    that the MCST was to be considered an unlimited liability company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I was not persuaded by Mr Yap’s
                    argument that ss 29, 34 and 35 of the BMSMA (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) indicated that a MCST was to be <em>generally</em> regarded as the agent of its SPs. Although there was
                    some superficial similarity between these provisions and
                        s 84A(1A)(<em>a</em>) of the LTSA (which the Court
                    of Appeal relied upon in <em>Horizon Towers</em> as
                    statutory confirmation of the agency relationship between a SC and the SPs of a
                    strata development (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above)) in
                    terms of the language used (especially the use of the phrase “on behalf
                    of” in ss 34 and 35 of the BMSMA), in my view, these provisions either
                    did not establish an agency relationship at all, or only did so in <em>specific contexts</em>, and could not be extrapolated so as
                    to deem a MCST the agent of its SPs for all purposes. For instance, s 32(3)
                    of the BMSMA enabled a MCST to make by-laws for the purpose of controlling and
                    managing the use or enjoyment of the common property, and s 32(10) enabled
                    the MCST to apply to court to enforce those by-laws. It could not seriously be
                    argued that, in enforcing by-laws against an errant SP, a MCST was acting as
                    agent for all the SPs, <em>including</em> the errant SP,
                    simply because s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) of the BMSMA
                    provided that it was the duty of a MCST “to control, manage and
                    administer the common property <em>for the benefit of all the
                        subsidiary proprietors</em> constituting the management
                    corporation” [emphasis added]. In fact, even if it were argued that, in
                    such circumstances, the MCST was acting as agent for all the SPs <em>excluding</em> the errant SP, that would lead to the
                    unpalatable result that the non-errant SPs could, relying on <em>Horizon Towers</em>, gain access to the MCST’s legal
                    advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Consequently, the respondent, in my judgment,
                    would ordinarily have been entitled as a separate legal person to claim legal
                    advice privilege, even as against a SP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Estoril</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before the STB and in his written submissions
                    on appeal, Mr Yap also relied on the authority of <em>The
                        Estoril</em>. Although I was not bound by it, I did not agree with the
                    reasoning employed in that case, and in my opinion it was inconsistent with
                    other more persuasive authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>The Estoril</em>,
                    the facts were similar to the present case. The applicant was a SP and a Council
                    member of the development known as “The Estoril”, and matters
                    pertaining to his unit were discussed at a Council Meeting of the MCST of The
                    Estoril. The applicant was present at this meeting but was excluded during the
                    discussions of his unit. Subsequently, he requested for a copy of the minutes of
                    the meeting, but received only a redacted copy. Dissatisfied, the applicant
                    applied for inspection of the unredacted minutes pursuant to s 54 of the
                    Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158) (1988 Rev Ed) (“the 1988
                    Act”) (which was largely <em>in pari materia</em>
                    with s 47 of the BMSMA (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above)),
                    which he followed up with an application to the STB (“the Estoril
                    Board”) for an order under s 106 of the 1988 Act (which was
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with <em>s </em>113 of the BMSMA) that the MCST of The Estoril supply him
                    the unredacted minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The MCST of The Estoril resisted the
                    application on the ground that the minutes were privileged from production as
                    they contained “matters of strategy” and “matters of
                    evidence” that pertained to the litigation between the parties pending in
                    the Subordinate Courts. In other words, the MCST of The Estoril was asserting
                    both legal advice privilege and litigation privilege against the applicant,
                    although that did not appear to affect the reasoning of the Estoril Board, which
                    decided against the MCST of The Estoril as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are of the view that the Minutes are not privileged from production for
                        two main reasons. In the first place the Applicant is a subsidiary
                        proprietor who is entitled to the Minutes as of right under S. 54 of the
                        [1988 Act]. Section 54 of the [1988 Act] is clear and unambiguous and does
                        not lay down any exceptions or restrictions to that right. In the second
                        place an examination of the copy of the Minutes (with certain items blanked
                        out) produced before the Board… show that a wide range of topics
                        [was] discussed at the meeting in question including matters relating to the
                        [applicant’s unit]. The failure of the Respondents [the MCST of The
                        Estoril] to have not acted with more circumspect [<em>sic</em>] in taking legal advice as claimed at a Council Meeting
                        and then recording what the Respondents claim to be such advice in the
                        Minutes should not be a ground for shutting out the Applicant or denying him
                        a complete copy of the [Minutes]. The Respondents have themselves to blame
                        for the predicament in which they find themselves when they knew or ought to
                        have known full well that the Minutes will have to be produced to the
                        Applicant both in his capacity as a Council member and as subsidiary
                        proprietor. [Had] the Council sought legal advice on the proper recording of
                        the minutes in the light of S. 54 of the [1988 Act] the impasse that had
                        arisen in this case could have been avoided. Finally even if we are wrong in
                        the interpretation of Section 54 of the [1988 Act] we are of the view that
                        the Respondents have clearly waived the privilege by disclosing the Minutes
                        (with certain portions blanked out) to the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is clear from the principles enunciated in [<em>Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co and
                            others</em> [1981] 1 WLR 529.] In that case [Templeman
                        LJ] summarised the law as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“In my judgment the simplest, safest and most straightforward
                            rule is that if a document is privileged then privilege must be
                            asserted, if at all, to the whole document unless that document deals
                            with separate subject matters so that the document can in effect be
                            divided into two separate and distinct documents each of which is
                            complete ….. the rule that privilege relating to a document which
                            deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted
                            as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of
                            a document may be unfair or misleading, that the party who possesses the
                            document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial
                            disclosure is misleading or not, nor can the judge ; [<em>sic</em>] decide without hearing argument nor can he hear
                            argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side.
                            Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into
                            evidence or using it in Court it cannot be erased.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are of the view that to furnish only part of the Minutes to the
                        Applicant would be unfair or misleading. We are not here dealing with a
                        document that is capable of severance into two separate and distinct
                        documents each of which is complete and can exist on its own. We are here
                        dealing with Minutes of a council meeting which is not capable of severance
                        into two documents least of all exist as two separate and distinct
                        documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     
          <em>The Estoril</em>,
                    therefore, appeared to be authority for the proposition that a MCST could not
                    assert legal advice privilege against a SP under s 54 of the 1988 Act (or
                    s 47 of the BMSMA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, insofar as the Estoril Board’s
                    reasoning based on a construction of s 54 of the 1988 Act (or s 47 of
                    the BMSMA) was concerned, I did not agree with it for the reasons explained at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the same reasons, neither did I agree with
                    the Estoril Board’s view that the MCST of The Estoril should have acted
                    with more circumspection, presumably by not recording legal advice in the
                    minutes of the Council meeting, when it ought to have known that the minutes
                    would have to be produced to the applicant under s 54 of the 1988 Act. This
                    already assumed that s 54 of the 1988 Act did indeed override legal advice
                    privilege; if it did not, then it would have been entirely reasonable for the
                    MCST of The Estoril to record legal advice in the minutes, safe in the knowledge
                    that such advice could not thereafter be disclosed under s 54 of the 1988
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As for the Estoril Board’s reliance on
                        <em>Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co and
                        others</em> [1981] 1 WLR 529 (“<em>Great Atlantic</em>”), the Estoril Board appeared to have
                    overlooked the fact that in <em>Great Atlantic</em>, the
                    entire document was privileged, and it was in that context that the English
                    Court of Appeal held that, unless the document could be severed into two
                    distinct and separate documents, a party could not be permitted to
                    “cherrypick” by disclosing the parts of the document that were
                    favourable, yet retain privilege for those which were unfavourable (see
                    generally <em>Phipson</em> at paras 26-09 to 26-10).
                    However, where only <em>part</em> of a document was
                    privileged, <em>eg</em>, mere references to legal advice in
                    otherwise unprivileged documents, it was perfectly permissible to disclose only
                    the unprivileged portion by redacting the privileged portion (<em>Skandinaviska</em> at [99] and [100], citing C Hollander, <em>Documentary Evidence</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        9<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) at paras 12-07 and 12-09, and
                        <em>Consolidated Contractors International Company SAL and

                    [51]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It followed, therefore, that the respondent
                    did not lose the protection of legal advice privilege simply because it had
                    furnished Mr Yap with redacted versions of the documents he had
                    sought.</p>

                    right to resist the compulsory disclosure of information”, a description
                    which I considered was equally applicable to legal advice privilege. Section 47
                    of the BMSMA was clearly a provision directed at the compulsory disclosure of
                    information, for it provided that:</p>

                    non-privileged portions of the relevant documents, the remaining question,
                    therefore, was whether s 47 of the BMSMA, on its true construction,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Commonwealth authorities have generally
                    concluded that it must be extremely clear from the statutory language and intent
                    before legal advice privilege is to be regarded as having been excluded or
                    overridden. In the UK, a statute will not be read as excluding or overriding
                    legal advice privilege unless such an intention was expressly stated or appeared

                        Ltd) v Special Commissioners of Income Tax and another</em> [2003]
                    1 AC 563 (“<em>Morgan
                    Grenfell</em>”) at [8] (<em>per</em> Lord
                    Hoffmann) and [44] (<em>per</em> Lord Hobhouse); <em>McE v Prison Service of Northern Ireland and another (Northern
                        Ireland Human Rights Commission and others intervening)</em> [2009]

                    Phillips) and [97] (<em>per</em> Lord Carswell)). The same
                    approach is adopted in Australia (<em>The Daniels Corporation
                        International Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Competition and Consumer
                        Commission</em> (2002) 213 CLR 543 (“<em>Daniels</em>”) at [11] (<em>per</em> Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), [88] (<em>per</em> Kirby J) and [132] (<em>per</em> Callinan J)) and New Zealand (<em>Auckland
                        District Law Society</em> at [57] to [59]). In Canada, the test
                    appears to be even stricter, in that legal advice privilege cannot be abrogated
                    by inference, and the statutory intention to abrogate legal advice privilege
                    must be “clearly or unequivocally” expressed (<em>Colleen Pritchard v Ontario Human Rights Commission (Attorney General of
                        Canada, Attorney General of Ontario, Canadian Human Rights Commission and
                        Manitoba Human Rights Commission (Interveners))</em> [2004]
                    1 SCR 809 at [33] and [35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The strictness of these tests stems from the
                    view that legal advice privilege, as part of LPP, is a “fundamental human
                    right” (<em>Morgan Grenfell</em> at [7] (<em>per</em> Lord Hoffmann) and <em>Daniels</em> at [86] (<em>per</em> Kirby J)),
                    or, in less exalted terms, a “basic tenet of the common law”
                        (<em>Morgan Grenfell</em> at [44] (<em>per</em> Lord Hobhouse)), and therefore required a clear expression
                    of Parliamentary intention to be overridden. Indeed, so stringent are these
                    tests that commentators have noted that, given the rarity of statutes which
                    expressly abrogate legal advice privilege, implied abrogation will be difficult
                    to establish (see <em>Phipson</em> at para 23-35, <em>Cross &amp; Tapper</em> at p 462 and S McNicol, <em>Law of Privilege</em> (The Law Book Company Limited, 1992) at
                    pp 113 to 135).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In Singapore, both the rationale for and
                    strictness of the English approach have been decisively endorsed by the Court of
                    Appeal. In <em>Skandinaviska</em>, the Court of Appeal
                    cited [7] of <em>Morgan Grenfell</em> with approval (at
                    [24]), and commented (at [23]) that legal advice privilege “has been
                    firmly entrenched as part of the common law system of justice for
                    centuries”. In <em>Leong Wai Kay v Carrefour Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 78, the Court of Appeal affirmed
                    (at [13]) the established principle of statutory interpretation that legislation
                    is not presumed to take away existing rights except expressly or by necessary
                    implication, citing with approval Bowen LJ’s reminder in <em>In re Cuno</em> (1889) 43 Ch D 12 (at 17) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n the construction of statutes, you must not construe the words so as
                        to take away rights which already existed before the statute was passed,
                        unless you have plain words which indicate that such was the intention of
                        the legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It was accepted by the parties, and obvious on
                    the face of the provision, that s 47 of the BMSMA did not expressly
                    abrogate legal advice privilege. Consequently, legal advice privilege would only
                    have been excluded or overridden by the BMSMA if it was a necessary implication
                    from the BMSMA generally, or s 47 specifically, to abrogate the legal
                    advice privilege a MCST would otherwise have been capable of asserting against a
                    SP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The meaning of the expression
                    “necessary implication” was explained by Lord Hobhouse in
                        <em>Morgan Grenfell</em>, and was endorsed by the Privy
                    Council in <em>Auckland District Law Society</em> (at
                    [58]). As Lord Hobhouse stated (at 616):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A necessary implication is not the same as a reasonable implication. A
                            <em>necessary</em> implication is one which
                        necessarily follows from the express provisions of the statute construed in
                        their context. It distinguishes between what it would have been sensible or
                        reasonable for Parliament to have included or what Parliament would, if it
                        had thought about it, probably have included and what it is clear that the
                        express language of the statute shows that the statute must have included. A
                        necessary implication is a matter of express language and logic not
                        interpretation. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I was satisfied that there was nothing in the
                    express language, context and logic of the BMSMA to show that legal advice
                    privilege had been impliedly overridden by s 47.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, such a construction of s 47 of
                    the BMSMA did not result in an interpretation which failed to promote the
                    purpose of the BMSMA. Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    2002 Rev Ed) (“IA”) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Purposive interpretation of written law and use of
                            extrinsic materials</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9A</b>. –(1) In the interpretation of a
                        provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose
                        or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is
                        expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an
                        interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The preamble to the BMSMA states that it is an
                    Act “to provide for the proper maintenance and management of
                    buildings”, and undoubtedly the BMSMA was intended to facilitate the
                    orderly regulation of strata developments. In my view, that purpose would be
                    promoted by allowing and encouraging a MCST to take legal advice as to its
                    rights and duties, and it followed that it was necessary to extend the
                    protection of legal advice privilege to a MCST, for the reasons articulated by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Skandinaviska</em> at [23] to
                    [26]. As a MCST may from time to time find it necessary, in the course of its
                    duties, to take legal action against errant SPs (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) or fend off legal action by its SPs, it was not, in
                    my judgment, in accordance with the statutory purpose of the BMSMA to allow the
                    SPs (including the very SPs with whom the MCST was in dispute) to freely
                    disregard legal advice privilege and obtain access to the MCST’s
                    privileged legal advice. To do so would create a chilling effect on the
                    willingness of a MCST to take legal advice or vindicate its rights, and
                    ultimately hamper the MCST in the fulfilment of its statutory duties under the
                    BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Hence, the BMSMA did not necessarily imply
                    that legal advice privilege had been abrogated in s 47: a purposive
                    interpretation of s 47 of the BMSMA demanded that it be read subject to
                    legal advice privilege, and hence the respondent could assert legal advice
                    privilege against Mr Yap’s request for privileged documents under
                    s 47 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For these reasons, I did not accept the
                    reasoning in <em>The Estoril</em> (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> and <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    above) that legal advice privilege was overridden because “[s 47 of the
                    BMSMA] is clear and unambiguous and does not lay down any exceptions or
                    restrictions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">STB’s alleged failure to inspect the respondent’s
                documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Yap’s complaint in this regard
                    was that the respondent had a habit of making extravagant and unjustified claims
                    of legal advice privilege, and that, in failing to inspect the legal advice in
                    respect of which legal advice privilege was being claimed by the respondent, the
                    STB had erred in law by depriving itself of relevant and admissible evidence.
                    This argument, therefore, assumed that legal advice privilege could be claimed
                    by the respondent, but asserted that the STB may have wrongly allowed it to be
                    claimed in respect of item (d) (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I had grave doubts whether this could aptly be
                    characterised as a “point of law” in respect of which an appeal
                    lay to the High Court. The respondent had addressed the STB as to dispensing
                    with providing it copies of the legal advice given by the respondent’s
                    lawyers in respect of the respondent’s claims or potential claims against
                    Karim, Ponda and Mr Yap (item (d)), and it seemed to me that the STB had
                    made a factual decision agreeing with the respondent that it did not need to
                    examine the legal advice before determining the real point of law in issue,
                        <em>ie</em>, whether an application for disclosure of
                    that advice under s 47 of the BMSMA could be resisted by the respondent on
                    the basis of legal advice privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     If so, then this aspect of the STB’s
                    decision was non-appealable. Further, even if this were to be regarded as a
                    “point of law”, there had been no error of law by the STB, since
                    the legal advice given to the MCST by its lawyers was obviously covered by legal
                    advice privilege. As counsel for the respondent put it, the issue was not
                    whether legal advice was covered by legal advice privilege (since it clearly
                    was), but whether legal advice privilege was a good answer to an application
                    under s 47 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Yap contended that the STB had
                    breached the rules of natural justice by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     Not admitting his reply marked
                        “AB4”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     Discontinuing the hearing without giving him the opportunity to
                        adduce evidence of the factual background; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     Discontinuing the hearing before the respondent
                        had completed its cross-examination of him, and therefore depriving him of
                        the opportunity to re-examine himself and cross-examine the
                        respondent’s witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Oddly, a breach of the rules of natural
                    justice did not feature in the examples of “<em>ex
                        facie</em> errors of law” listed by <em>Halsbury’s</em> and approved in <em>Horizon
                        Towers</em> (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Nonetheless, it seemed to me that, in
                    principle and on authority, a breach of the rules of natural justice could give
                    rise to an appeal “on a point of law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In principle, the errors of law listed by
                        <em>Halsbury’s</em>, if committed by an
                    administrative body subject to judicial review, would all result in the impugned
                    decision being <em>ultra vires</em> and hence void. It is
                    well-established that “a decision given without regard to the principles
                    of natural justice is void” (<em>Ridge v Baldwin and
                        others</em> [1964] 1 AC 40 at 80 (<em>per</em> Lord Reid)), with the possible qualification that
                    “not every breach of natural justice is equally serious”
                        (<em>Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee
                        Tat Development Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGCA 39 at [56], albeit this case
                    was not concerned with judicial review of administrative action). If so, then a
                    breach of the rules of natural justice ought also to be considered an <em>ex facie</em> error of law giving rise to an appeal under
                    s 98 of the BMSMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As a matter of authority, this view was
                    adopted by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Nina Begum v Tower
                        Hamlets London Borough Council</em> [2000] 1 WLR 306, where
                    Auld LJ held (at 313) that the words “point of law” in s 204
                    of the Housing Act 1996 (c 52) (UK), which provided for an appeal to the county
                    court on any “point of law” arising from the borough
                    council’s decision, included:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>… the full range of issues which would
                                otherwise be the subject of an application to the High Court for
                                judicial review, such as procedural
                            error…</em>
                [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was notable that, in that support of his view, Auld LJ cited
                    the same passage of H W R Wade &amp; C F Forsyth, <em>Administrative Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        7<sup>th</sup> ed, 1994) (at pp 951 to 952) which was relied
                    upon by the Court of Appeal in <em>Horizon Towers</em> (at
                    [101]), <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts ought… to guard against any artificial narrowing of the
                        right of appeal on a point of law, which is clearly intended to be a wide
                        and beneficial remedy. […] The extension in recent years of the right
                        of appeal on questions of law has… done much to assist the
                        integration of the tribunal system with the general machinery of justice.
                        Judicial policy ought to reinforce this beneficial trend.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">STB procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Regulation 18(1) of the Building Maintenance
                    and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005 (S 195/2005)
                    (“the 2005 Regulations”) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Board shall not be bound to apply the rules of evidence applicable to
                        civil proceedings in any court but may inform itself on any matter in such
                        manner as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     This formed the basis of the Court of
                    Appeal’s view in <em>Horizon Towers</em> (at [173])
                    that the STB had a “significant inquisitorial role”. In <em>Horizon Towers</em>, however, the point was not taken that
                    reg 18(1) might not have its intended effect, by reason of s 2 of the EA
                        (<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above), which states that Parts I,
                    II and III shall apply to all judicial proceedings in or before any court, but
                    not to proceedings before an arbitrator, and s 92(8) of the BMSMA, which
                    states that the arbitration proceedings of the STB shall be deemed to be
                    judicial proceedings. “Court” is defined in s 3 of the EA as
                    including all Judges and Magistrates and, <em>except
                        arbitrators</em>, all persons legally authorised to take evidence,
                    while s 92 of the BMSMA provides that the STB has powers to take evidence
                    (s 92(4)) and that the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) shall not
                    apply to mediation-arbitration proceedings before the STB. There was a distinct
                    possibility, therefore, that Parts I to III of the EA applied to proceedings
                    before the STB, notwithstanding reg 18(1) of the 2005 Regulations, as a result
                    of s 19(c) of the IA, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>General provisions with respect to power given to any
                            authority to make subsidiary legislation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19</b>. When any Act confers powers on any
                        authority to make subsidiary legislation, the following provisions shall,
                        unless the contrary intention appears, have effect with reference to the
                        making and operation of the subsidiary legislation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    no subsidiary legislation made under an Act
                                shall be inconsistent with the provisions of any Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Nonetheless, even if the provisions of the EA
                    did apply, I was of the view that Mr Yap’s complaints were without
                    foundation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Mr Yap’s reply in AB4 was not
                    admitted by the STB because it was late, and the respondent had objected to its
                    admission on the grounds that it contained scandalous and irrelevant material,
                    and had not complied with the STB’s directions as to the filing of
                    replies. The STB had heard submissions from both the respondent and Mr Yap
                    before it decided to exclude AB4, and there was therefore no question of a
                    breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As for Mr Yap’s complaints that the
                    hearing had been prematurely discontinued, this was because the STB had been
                    able to narrow the point of contention between the parties to the issue of
                    whether the respondent was entitled to claim legal advice privilege in respect
                    of items (a) to (d) (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), which was a
                    question of law that did not require the examination of witnesses before it
                    could be answered. That was why the STB dispensed with any further examination
                    and adjourned the hearing for parties to submit their written arguments
                        (<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Indeed, Mr Yap had even
                    conceded that the STB need only concern itself with the issue of whether to
                    order disclosure of the four items for which legal advice privilege was being
                    claimed by the respondent (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). Again,
                    therefore, there was no breach of any rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Yap argued that the STB erred in
                    ordering parties to bear their own costs, and that this was an “error of
                    law”, from which an appeal lay to the High Court under s 98 of the
                    BMSMA, because the STB failed to take into account relevant considerations in
                    making the costs order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The relevant considerations that the STB
                    purportedly failed to take into account were alleged instances of “bad
                    faith” on the part of the respondent both prior to, and during, the
                    proceedings before the STB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     However, these were not facts found by the STB
                    and were therefore not matters I could take cognisance of, even if they were
                    true (which I very much doubted). In the absence of any <em>ex
                        facie</em> errors of law, the STB’s costs order was wholly
                    within its discretion, and any appeal against it was predicated on questions of
                    fact which were non-appealable under s 98 of the BMSMA. Nor was this an
                    instance of an error of law of the sort described in <em>Edwards
                        v Bairstow</em>; the facts as found (and clearly there could not have
                    been many, since the STB’s determination was primarily concerned with a
                    question of law) fully justified the STB in ordering parties to bear their own
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the result, I dismissed Mr Yap’s
                    appeal, and fixed costs at $20,000, inclusive of disbursements.</p>
