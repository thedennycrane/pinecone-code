Lee relied on two grounds for striking out: (a) the plaintiff’s action was time-barred; and (b) the wrong party had been sued. The assistant registrar did not find that the suit was time-barred, but agreed that the wrong party had been sued. In relation to the plaintiff’s attempt to pierce the corporate veil against Lee, the assistant registrar was of the view that this was not sufficiently pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. While the assistant registrar would have been inclined to dismiss the application if there was evidence suggesting that the corporate veil could be pierced, no such evidence was included in the affidavit filed to resist the application. The plaintiff’s claim was thus struck out under O 18 r 19(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) on the basis that it was factually unsustainable.

There was adequate documentation supporting the defendants’ case that Dr Chen had been advised on the possibility of restoring UYI and/or IRS. This was particularly in the form of the 8 October Attendance Note, the letters exchanged between the parties, and the warrant to act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is true that the documents do not expressly mention s 343 CA. But in broad terms, the evidence showed that the second defendant was aware of and had mentioned the existence of a mechanism to restore struck-off companies to Dr Chen. The 8 October Attendance Note states:

Much will depend on the context, including the client, the point at which advice is given, and the purpose of the advice. It would often suffice for advice to be given at a higher level of generality and abstraction, without the citation or reference of specific statutory provisions or case law.  Clients do not instruct lawyers to be lectured upon on legal doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The limitation period would also have added additional demands. The limitation period is six years for both contract and tort. Since the cause of action against Lee accrued on 18 October 2006, any claim against Lee, UYI and/or IRS had to be commenced by 17 October 2012, nine days after the plaintiff first consulted the defendants. There appeared to be several possible courses of action that could have been taken by the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) commence legal proceedings against Lee, UYI and/or IRS ahead of 18 October 2012; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) commence legal proceedings at a later date while taking the position the claim was not time barred as it had been extended under the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Other options may have existed, but the duty of care imposed in contract and tort does not consist of a guarantee of a solution or success. These duties only require that the solicitor act in the same manner as a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor would. Failure by itself would not be sufficient to prove negligence or breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Filing the application ahead of the time bar would have been one option, but doing so would have been fraught with risk, particularly that of insufficient evidence. To my mind, shying away from commencing such a claim appeared to be a reasonable response.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is, I think, important here that the defendants did ask the plaintiff to go elsewhere. Dr Chen, however, insisted that the defendants continue to represent the plaintiff.  While this would not absolve the defendants of any negligence that occurred, it did go towards showing that the plaintiff was aware that the defendants had concluded that in their best assessment there was no case. In persisting in instructing the defendants, the plaintiff took the risk of anything falling short. This point was not, however, pleaded by the defendants as a supervening event breaking the chain of causation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the round, the advice given by the second defendant up till the meeting on 17 October 2012 was that there was an impending time bar coming up the same day, and that there appeared to be insufficient evidence. This was not an emergency situation, but I accepted that the standard of care expected of the defendants would have to be taken against the context of the time and deadline pressures, particularly the running out of the limitation period.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Any professional advisor would have to bear such constraints in advising and conducting any work for a client. What may be possible early on in the process may not be feasible late in the day, and certain avenues may have to be abandoned. Any advice given by a solicitor must be taken against the context of the facts presented to him or her: a solicitor does not advise clients <span class="font-italic">in vacuo</span>. This flows from the requirement for specificity as to what should have been advised laid down in <span class="font-italic">Nava</span> <span class="font-italic">Bharat</span> (see [25] above). Here, the defendants were first approached by the plaintiff on 8 October 2012, some nine days before the plaintiff’s claim against Lee would become time-barred (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>after 17 October 2012). In the circumstances, given the impending time bar, the advice given by the defendants would seem appropriate: there was little likelihood in practical terms of applying for restoration in time as this was unlikely to be granted before 18 October 2012 to allow proceedings to be commenced against UYI and/or IRS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any event, even if I were to accept that the defendants were negligent in failing to advise on the possibility of utilising ss 343 and 340 CA to reinstate the companies and impose personal liability on Lee, I did not think that the plaintiff had shown that it had any chance of succeeding in those claims. I elaborate on the feasibility of the plaintiff’s proposed applications under ss 343 and 340 CA below at [81]–[95].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Failure to conduct Suit 896/2012 properly</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 While there were aspects of the conduct of Suit 896/2012 that would overlap with the giving of advice, the focus of this section of the grounds is on the conduct of the suit itself.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The parties were in dispute about the warrant to act, which the defendants alleged had been signed on the plaintiff’s behalf by Dr Chen.

As mentioned above at [19], I did not accept Dr Chen’s contention that he did not read the 16 October Letter on the same day. In the 16 October Letter, the defendants highlighted to the plaintiff that there was insufficient evidence to prove fraud and/or deceit on the part of Lee. In an email to the second defendant on 16 October 2012, Dr Chen asked the second defendant to elaborate on the sort of evidence required to sustain a claim in fraud or deceit.

Certainly, there will on many occasions have to be an iterative, recurrent process in which the solicitor’s advice is needed to hone the thinking of the client about where such evidence may possibly be found. In the present case, I was satisfied that the defendants flagged the concerns about the lack of evidence, and there was no cure or lead proffered by the plaintiff.

However, the assistant registrar was of the view that the statement of claim did not contain any mention of piercing the corporate veil. While the assistant registrar was inclined to dismiss Lee’s striking out application, there was insufficient evidence provided in the affidavit filed by Dr Chen to resist the application; it was on this basis that the assistant registrar decided to strike out the plaintiff’s claim in Suit 896/2012 under O 18 r 19(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my view, the striking out of Suit 896/2012 was not attributable to any breach of the duty of care owed to the plaintiff on the part of the defendants. Rather, this was due to the failure of the plaintiff to provide sufficient evidence that would have allowed its claim to survive Lee’s striking out application. The plaintiff was unable to point to any evidence provided to the defendants which the latter failed to include in the affidavit filed by Dr Chen to resist Lee’s application</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (5) Failing to apply for leave to amend the statement of claim</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The plaintiff’s claim that the defendants breached their duty of care in failing to apply for leave to amend the statement of claim failed for the same reasons as its claim founded upon the failure to include sufficient particulars in the statement of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Any change to the pleadings would have ultimately been dependent on the instructions given by the plaintiff and the available evidence. As for any advice that ought to be given on this, such advice would have to be dependent on the state of the instructions. It is not incumbent on a lawyer to advise his or her client on all possible options; there is no obligation to be creative or inventive; what is competent must be measured and limited by the state of the instructions that have been received. Here, the plaintiff’s claim was struck out under O 18 r 19(b) of the ROC for lack of evidence (see [63] above). It follows that any amendment to the statement of claim would not have remedied this fundamental flaw in the plaintiff’s case.

</div>
</div> It should be noted at the outset that the applicable version of the professional conduct rules at the material time was the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2010 (Cap 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the PCR”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I am doubtful that r 16 of the PCR creates an obligation that is actionable in a civil claim by any person complaining of the breach. While not articulated as such by the plaintiff, the basis for such a claim would presumably have been the breach of a statutory duty. For a statutory duty to create a private right of action, the party asserting such a right must show that Parliament intended for the existence of a private right of action. The mere existence of a statutory remedy would also not be decisive as to the existence of a private right of action, and each statute would have to be interpreted contextually: see <span class="font-italic">Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 360 at [39], citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 2 SLR 549. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The plaintiff did not attempt to make out the existence of any private right in its pleadings or in its arguments.  I did not see anything on the surface of the PCR or the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) that would suggest the existence of such a private right of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 A breach of the PCR might be evidence pointing to a breach of a contractual or tortious duty, but for the reasons given above, I did not find that there was any such breach by the defendants. The plaintiff’s reference to the PCR did not take its case any further. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proof of loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I was of the view that even if the defendants were found to have been negligent in advising on and conducting Suit 896/2012, the plaintiff had failed to prove that it had suffered any loss, or that anything could have been recovered from the lawsuit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not adduced any evidence which would allow the court to conclude that it would have succeeded in the claims against Lee, UYI and IRS.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For damages to be recoverable, it must be shown that there was a substantial chance of success in the cause of action pursued. A substantial chance is taken in contradistinction to a speculative one: see <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp </span>[2015] 5 SLR 453 at [75]–[89], citing <span class="font-italic">Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons </span>[1995] 1 WLR 1602 (“<span class="font-italic">Allied Maples</span>”); see also <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 661 at [132]–[139]. I understood this to mean that such a chance could be less than on the balance of probabilities, but above something that was negligible or marginal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 An illustrative case in this regard is the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hatswell v Goldbergs</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm) </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 2084 (“<span class="font-italic">Hatswell</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Hatswell</span>, the defendant solicitors were negligent in advising the plaintiff to pursue an action against a doctor for medical negligence prior to his claim becoming time-barred. The English Court of Appeal adopted a two-step test in determining the quantum of damage recoverable at [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The process for the court is a two-stage process. First, the court must be satisfied that the claimant has lost something of value. An action which is bound to fail (or, as it was put in this court in [<span class="font-italic">Allied Maples</span>] has no substantial prospect of success and is merely speculative) is not something of value. It is only if the claim passes that test that the court has to evaluate in percentage terms of the full value of the claim what has been lost.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The English Court of Appeal, in finding that the plaintiff’s claim was bound to fail, upheld the assessment of the trial judge that the loss of chance from the defendant solicitor’s negligence was nil (at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The same principles were applicable in the present case. The plaintiff was required to show that there was a substantial chance of success in Suit 896/2012. The plaintiff also had to demonstrate that it had suffered loss as a result of its failure in Suit 896/2012, and that such losses could have been recovered from Lee, UYI and IRS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  Even on this lower threshold, I was of the view that the plaintiff was unlikely to succeed in its claim against Lee, UYI and IRS. First, it was unlikely that the plaintiff could have successfully applied to reinstate UYI and IRS before the time bar set in on 18 October 2012, such as to allow proceedings to be commenced against the companies. Second, there was insufficient evidence to show that the plaintiff would have succeeded in an application under s 340 CA to hold Lee personally liable. It followed that the plaintiff would not have suffered any loss even if the defendants were found to have been negligent in the present action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I was also not satisfied that the plaintiff had showed that it had suffered any losses from the alleged fraud committed by Lee, or that it would have been able to successfully enforce any judgment obtained against either Lee or the companies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Likelihood of success</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendants contended that the plaintiff failed to show that the action against the companies, even if they had been reinstated, as well as against Lee, had a substantial chance of success. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It was unlikely that an action to reinstate the companies under s 343 CA, as well as to proceed against Lee personally under s 340 CA, would have had a substantial chance of succeeding based on the evidence that was available then, and the evidence before me in this claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, no authority was cited by the plaintiff to show that the very act of filing an application under s 343 CA could have frozen the running of the time bar, nor does it appear to have been part of its pleaded case. Second, I noted that there was no opinion exhibited that supported the use of s 340 CA in the way contended for by the plaintiff. No specific case was cited either that involved an analogous claim. It seemed a little bit odd in the circumstances that the plaintiff set such store by s 340 CA.

In <span class="font-italic">Lee Hung Pin</span>, I recognised that the discretion conferred on the court in s 343(1) CA was to be exercised “carefully and judicially, bearing in mind the likely objectives of the grant of that power” (at [25]). Reasons would have to be given to persuade the court to grant such a declaration. But more importantly, an application under s 343 CA would have had to take time, which was not possible in the circumstances given the looming time bar. Certainly, some request for urgency and expediency could have been made to the courts. Even then, cogent reasons would have had to be given for the delay in pursuing the claims against UYI and/or IRS, and in then seeking to restore them ahead of such proceedings. It was not clear to me that such reasons were raised by the plaintiff even at the hearing before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It was also not apparent to me how an action could have been commenced against UYI and/or IRS (which had been struck off) prior to an application being granted for their restoration under s 343 CA. No authority was cited to me for the proposition that reinstatement of a previously struck off company under s 343 CA would retrospectively confer validity on an action commenced when that same company did not possess legal status.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Section 340 Companies Act</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The plaintiff alleged that it was defrauded by Lee through UYI and/or IRS. An application under s 340 CA would allow it to obtain an order making Lee personally liable for the debts of the companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The defendants argued that the elements for an action under s 340 CA were not met. The plaintiff was only a contingent creditor. There was also a lack of evidence to show that the business of UYI and/or IRS had been carried out with intent to defraud its creditors, and that Lee was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of the companies in that manner. What the plaintiff had against Lee fell short.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Section 340 CA requires that the application for a declaration imposing personal liability on a director of a company be made by “the liquidator or any creditor or contributory”. The defendant took the position that the plaintiff lacked standing as it did not satisfy any of these requirements; the plaintiff could at best be described as a contingent creditor, and there was no case law interpreting the meaning of creditor in s 340 CA to include a contingent creditor. To my mind, there was some room for the plaintiff to have made itself out as a creditor. I did not consider this to be an insurmountable obstacle for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Rather, this aspect of the case turned on the lack of sufficient evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim. In this regard, the more serious the allegation of fraud under s 340 CA, the more the plaintiff would have had to do in order to establish its case, though the requisite standard of proof remains that of a balance of probabilities: see <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In a claim under s 340 CA, it must be shown that the business of the company was carried on with “intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose”, and that the defendant was “knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner”: see <span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore Pte Ltd v Leow Tet Sin </span>[2015] 2 SLR 271 at [102]. I accepted the arguments of the defendants that these elements would have presented considerable obstacles given the instructions given to the second defendant at the material time:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The business of UYI and/or IRS must be carried on to defraud. The commission of fraud alone is not enough; the business as a whole must be implicated: see <span class="font-italic">Liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd v Chan Ah Lek </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 77 at [17]–[26]. This would entail a considerable amount of evidence about the activities of the companies.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)    There also had to be evidence to show that Lee was involved in fraud. The allegations made by the plaintiff centred on alleged misrepresentations by Lee that she was the sole distributor of Immunotec Products in Singapore and that she could assign her distributorship rights to the plaintiff (through UYI and/or IRS).

</div> But to get to that point, there had to be sufficient basis for the allegation to be made, such that it would at least survive a striking out application by going beyond a bare allegation. As it was, the assistant registrar, in striking out Suit 896/2012, found that there was no evidence given that would support a piercing of the corporate veil (see [63] below). While this was on a different point, it demonstrated that it was more likely than not that the plaintiff would have difficulty maintaining a cause of action under s 340 CA. Furthermore, no evidence was given that such evidence would have in fact been discoverable had the defendants helped the plaintiff persist in the suit.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss suffered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The defendants also argued that, in any event, the plaintiff failed to show loss in respect to the claims against Lee, UYI and IRS that would have been recoverable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff relied on the following evidence to demonstrate its alleged losses:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a valuation report on the plaintiff’s business report (“the Fiducia Report”) prepared by its expert witness, Mr Soo Hon Weng (“Mr Soo”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an in-house valuation prepared by Dr Chen (“Dr Chen’s Valuation Report”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Quantum of loss</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The plaintiff’s claims on the quantum of its alleged losses were weak and unsubstantiated.

However, as neither parties’ pleaded case turned on this point, I need not say more.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the circumstances, while I awarded costs against the plaintiff, I did not agree with the defendants that this was an appropriate case to impose costs on an indemnity basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Yew Joseph v Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGHC 274 at [98] considered when an award of indemnity costs should be made:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 Order 59 r 5 sets out several factors which a court should take into account in considering whether it is “appropriate” to make an exceptional award of indemnity costs. These factors include the conduct of the paying party before and during the proceedings. However, the list in Order 59 r 5 is not exhaustive. In <span class="font-italic">Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc </span>(10 December 1993, unreported), Millet J held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The power to order taxation on an indemnity basis is not confined to cases which have been brought with an ulterior motive or for an improper purpose. Litigants who conduct their cases in bad faith, or as a personal vendetta, or in an improper or oppressive manner, or who cause costs to be incurred irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake, may also expect to be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis if they lose, and have part of their costs disallowed if they win. Nor are these necessarily the only situations where the jurisdiction may be exercised; the discretion is not to be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation on an indemnity basis must be ‘appropriate’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Coomaraswamy J also cited approvingly the list of factors set out by Tomlinson J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Co of the Bank of England (No 6 ) </span>[2006] EWHC 816 (Comm) at [25] (at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 There were aspects of plaintiff’s case that did not appear well founded and were not supported by evidence. However, given the relative brevity of the trial, it was not necessary for any sanction to be imposed on the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For the reasons above, the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Syn Kok Kay (Patrick Chin, Syn &amp; Co) for the plaintiff; <br/>Christopher Anand Daniel, Harjean Kaur and J Jayaletchmi (Advocatus Law LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
