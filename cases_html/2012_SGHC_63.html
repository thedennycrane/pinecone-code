<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff, Lim Suat Hua (“Lim”) was employed by the defendant, Singapore
HealthPartners Pte Ltd (“Singapore HealthPartners”) between 1 September
2007 and 25 July 2010. Pursuant to the execution of a Settlement
and Share Purchase Agreement dated 12 July 2010 (“the Settlement
Agreement”), Lim’s employment was terminated with effect from 25 July
2010. Lim brought this Action against Singapore HealthPartners for
the amount allegedly owing to her under the terms of her employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Singapore
HealthPartners was incorporated on 9 March 2006. It is in the business
of developing a medical complex comprising a hospital, medical suites
and a hotel at No 1 Farrer Park Station Road to be named the “Connexion”
(“the Project”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Lim
was one of the initial shareholders and directors of Singapore HealthPartners.
Pursuant to a service agreement dated 1 September 2007, entered
into between Singapore HealthPartners and Lim (“Lim’s Service Agreement”),
Lim was appointed as the Executive Director of Singapore HealthPartners.
Under cl 4.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement, she was to be paid $60,000
per month. She was also entitled to 30 business days of leave a
year under cl 5.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Djeng
Shih Kien (“Djeng”), the other initial shareholder of Singapore HealthPartners,
was appointed Executive Chairman of Singapore HealthPartners pursuant
to a similar service agreement entered into between himself and
Singapore HealthPartners on 1 September 2007 (“Djeng’s Service Agreement”).
Under cl 4.1 of Djeng’s Service Agreement, he was to be paid $70,000
per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On
26 September 2007, pursuant to an investment agreement executed
on 29 June 2007 (“the Investment Agreement”), a number of medical
doctors or their corporate vehicles (collectively “the Investors Group”),
Berjaya Leisure (Cayman) Ltd (“Berjaya”) and Wharton Scott Pte Ltd
(“Wharton Scott”) were registered as new shareholders of Singapore HealthPartners.
As entitled to under the Investment Agreement, the new shareholders
nominated directors (“the new directors”) to represent their respective
interests. The new directors were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Maurice
Choo, Richard Chew and Whang Hwee Yong for the Investors Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dato’
Lee Kok Chuan and Dato’ Tan Yeong Ching (with Ng Chee Yau as alternate
director) for Berjaya; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Tan
Soon Hoe and Richard Charles Helfer for Wharton Scott.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Some
of the new directors took issue with both Lim’s Service Agreement
and Djeng’s Service Agreement (collectively “the Service Agreements”).
They alleged that the Service Agreements were signed before the
new directors had been appointed, and that Djeng and Lim had for
their mutual benefit signed each other’s Service Agreement. Further,
they alleged that there was no board resolution approving the terms
of the Service Agreements and that no disclosure of the Service
Agreements was made to the new directors. The new directors were
dissatisfied as to why no explanation was offered for the urgency
in putting in place the Service Agreements prior to the registration
of the new shareholders and the nomination of new directors. In
addition, the new directors felt that the remuneration of both Lim
and Djeng was excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As
such, at the conclusion of the board of directors meeting on 21 March
2009 (“the 21 March 2009 board meeting”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Djeng
agreed to step down from his position as Executive Chairman of Singapore
HealthPartners on the basis that Singapore HealthPartners would
not pursue any claims against him; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     it
was resolved that a Remuneration Committee be set up “to review
Directors’ Fees and Directors’ Remunerations [<em>sic</em>],
including retrospectively review [<em>sic</em>]
the appropriateness of past Directors’ Remuneration”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At
the next board meeting on 30 March 2009, it was resolved that Lim be
offered “a New Service Agreement (NSA) for the period from 1 April 2009
to TOP [Temporary Occupation Permit] of the project, at a monthly basic
salary of S$50,000”. All other terms in Lim’s Service Agreement
were unchanged. According to Singapore HealthPartners, Lim had verbally agreed
to this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       From
July 2009 onwards, the situation worsened as the directors and shareholders
split into two factions. On one side was the faction headed by Djeng,
comprising Djeng, Lim and the Berjaya directors. On the other was the
faction that comprised the Investors Group directors and the Wharton Scott
directors. The dispute initially was over the question whether Djeng was
entitled to remain as Chairman of Singapore HealthPartners notwithstanding
his resignation at the 21 March 2009 board meeting. The dispute
resulted in several arbitral and court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Eventually,
the two factions concluded that the best way of resolving the disputes
was for one side to buy the other out. As a result, the Settlement
Agreement was executed on 12 July 2010. Pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim,
Djeng and Berjaya exited as shareholders of Singapore HealthPartners;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim’s
last day of employment as Executive Director of Singapore HealthPartners
was to be 25 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Following
the mutual termination of Lim’s employment on 25 July 2010, Lim
and Singapore HealthPartners disagreed over the amount of salary
that was owing to Lim. Lim brought this Action against Singapore HealthPartners
on 22 October 2010 for the amount allegedly owing to her under Lim’s
Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Lim’s
claim against Singapore HealthPartners for unpaid salary was made
up of three components:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     Claim
for “short-paid” salary from May 2009 to June 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Claim
for pro-rated salary for July 2010; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Claim
for compensation for unconsumed leave of 37 days for the years 2008,
2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim for “short-paid” salary
from May 2009 to June 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Under
cl 4.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement, Singapore HealthPartners was
to pay Lim a monthly salary of $60,000. Lim alleged that in breach
of Lim’s Service Agreement, Singapore HealthPartners had only paid
her $50,000 per month for the period May 2009 to June 2010. This
resulted in Lim suffering a loss of $140,000 over the 14-month period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim for pro-rated salary for
July 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As
mentioned earlier, Lim’s last day of employment pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement was 25 July 2010. Lim pleaded that her pro-rated salary
for July 2010 ought to be $46,251.64.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim for compensation for unconsumed
leave of 37 days for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At
trial, Lim withdrew her claim for compensation for unconsumed leave
for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s eventual claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Therefore,
Lim’s claim against Singapore HealthPartners is for the sum of $186,026.64,
the breakdown of which is as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defendant’s pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Singapore
HealthPartners’ defence to Lim’s claim is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim’s
Service Agreement had been varied as of April 2009 such that the
monthly salary provided therein was reduced from $60,000 to $50,000
(“the Varied Service Agreement”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Alternatively,
an estoppel by convention/common assumption operated to prevent
Lim from relying on the monthly salary of $60,000 provided in Lim’s
Service Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Lim’s
pro-rated salary for July 2010 should be based on the reduced monthly
salary of $50,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Singapore
HealthPartners is entitled to a set off and counterclaim against
Lim’s pro-rated salary for July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Singapore
HealthPartners’ counterclaim against Lim is for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim’s
breach of fiduciary obligations as a director of Singapore HealthPartners;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim’s
breach of duties of loyalty and fidelity owed to Singapore HealthPartners
by virtue of Lim’s Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s Service Agreement was
varied such that the monthly salary provided therein was reduced
from $60,000 to $50,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Singapore
HealthPartners pleaded that on or about 26 March 2009, Maurice Choo
had verbally informed Lim that her salary of $60,000 was excessive
and proposed that Lim’s Service Agreement be varied such that her
monthly salary would be reduced to $50,000 (“Maurice Choo’s proposal on
26 March 2009”). Singapore HealthPartners averred that on or about 27 March
2009, Lim had verbally informed Maurice Choo that she agreed to
the reduction of her monthly salary to $50,000. Further, or in the alternative,
Lim’s Act of accepting the reduced salary was an acceptance of Maurice
Choo’s proposal on 26 March 2009, which acceptance was re-affirmed
by the acceptance of the reduced salary every month until July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Estoppel by convention/common
assumption operated to prevent Lim from relying on the monthly salary
of $60,000 provided in Lim’s Service Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Assuming
that Lim’s Service Agreement had not been varied, Singapore HealthPartners
pleaded in the alternative that pursuant to Maurice Choo’s proposal
on 26 March 2009, Lim and Singapore HealthPartners Acted on a shared
assumption that Lim would only be entitled to a monthly salary of
$50,000 with effect from 1 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This
assumption was Acted and relied upon by Lim when she received the
reduced salary for the period 1 May 2009 to 30 June 2010. She also
signed authorisation letters on behalf of Singapore HealthPartners
to instruct the bank to make payments into her bank account based
on the reduced salary for the period 1 May 2009 to 30 June 2010.
Lim had further Acted and relied on this shared assumption by not
addressing the issue of her reduced salary in the Settlement Agreement.
Singapore HealthPartners had also relied on the shared assumption
and as a result took no step to ensure that the reduction of salary
was legally perfected. As such, Singapore HealthPartners pleaded
that it would be unconscionable for Lim to resile from the shared
assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s pro-rated salary for July
2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Singapore
HealthPartners does not dispute that it owes Lim her pro-rated salary
for July 2010. However, it disputes the quantum of the said salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Firstly,
it asserts that the pro-rated amount should be based on the reduced
salary of $50,000. Secondly, it claims that it is entitled to deduct
the sums of $16,438.36 (being the gross amount of salary for over-consumed leave
in 2010) and $10,000 (being the excess amount that Lim paid herself in
April 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As
such, Singapore HealthPartners avers that the amount it owes Lim for
July 2010 is only $13,546.22.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Counterclaims for breach of
fiduciary duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Firstly,
Singapore HealthPartners pleaded that Lim made unauthorised overseas
trips at its expense, causing it a loss of $42,105. The first was
a trip to Thailand from 1 to 3 October 2008 (“the Thailand trip”) and
the second, a trip to New Zealand from 20 to 24 October 2008 (“the New
Zealand trip”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Secondly,
Singapore HealthPartners seek an order for an account and inquiry
in relation to secret profits received by Wizvision Pte Ltd (“Wizvision”)
and Fidelio Realty Pte Ltd (“Fidelio”). Additionally, Singapore
HealthPartners seek an order for payment to itself of all sums found
due and owing on the taking of the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Wizvision
had provided information technology services to Singapore HealthPartners
from around November 2007 to around September 2010. According to
Singapore HealthPartners, Lim had been a director of Wizvision since
7 April 2000. Her son, Lim Kong Wee, had been an alternate director
of Wizvision from 7 December 2007 to 2 August 2009 and a director
of Wizvision since 3 August 2009. In addition, Lim and another of
her sons, Lim Wee Kiat, had direct and indirect shareholdings of at
least 32% in Wizvision which they failed, refused and/or neglected
to fully disclose to the board of Singapore HealthPartners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Fidelio
were co-brokers of a tenancy which Singapore HealthPartners had
entered into in or around 2007. As co-brokers, Fidelio were alleged
to have received a fee of $4,935. According to Singapore HealthPartners,
Lim and Lim Kong Wee were shareholders of Fidelio, and Lim had failed, refused
and/or neglected to disclose that she and her son were shareholders of
Fidelio. However, at trial, Singapore HealthPartners withdrew its
claim against Lim in relation to Fidelio.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With
regard to Lim’s claim, the issues which need to be dealt with are as
follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
there was an agreement between Lim and Singapore HealthPartners
to reduce Lim’s monthly salary from $60,000 to $50,000 (“the Variation
Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether,
alternatively, an estoppel by convention and/or common assumption
operates to prevent Lim from relying on cl 4.1 of Lim’s Service
Agreement which stipulates a monthly salary of $60,000 (“the Estoppel
Issue”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether
Lim had taken excess leave of ten days in 2010 for which Singapore
HealthPartners should be credited with $16,438.36 (“the Excess Leave
Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With
regard to Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaim, the following issues
need to be resolved:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether
Lim had paid herself $10,000 in excess of the salary she was entitled
to for the month of April 2009 (“the Excess Payment Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
the Settlement Agreement constituted a waiver, release or discharge
of Singapore HealthPartners’ claims (“the Waiver, Release and Discharge
Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     If
not waived, released or discharged, whether the overseas trips were
unauthorised and constituted a breach of Lim’s fiduciary duties to
Singapore HealthPartners (“the Unauthorised Trips Issue”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     If
not waived, released or discharged, whether Lim had breached her
fiduciary duties to Singapore HealthPartners by failing to disclose
her direct and indirect stakes in Wizvision (“the Disclosure Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Variation Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It
is noted that Lim does not dispute that Maurice Choo had on or about
26 March 2009 proposed to her that her salary be reduced to $50,000. However,
Lim asserts that, in any event, Maurice Choo “was not duly authorised
by [Singapore HealthPartners] to make that request or otherwise
vary the Service Agreement” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     Maurice
Choo was only appointed as an interim chairman at the 21 March 2009
board meeting;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     Maurice
Choo had not, prior to making the proposal to Lim, brought the proposal
to the board of directors for its consideration; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     There
was no resolution by the board of directors for Maurice Choo to
make such a proposal to Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Another
issue is whether Lim had on 27 March 2009 verbally agreed to Maurice
Choo’s proposal on 26 March 2009. Lim denies having agreed to Maurice
Choo’s proposal. At trial, Lim maintained that she did not, at any point
in time, agree to the reduction of her monthly salary. According
to her, even up till the date of the mutual termination of her employment pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement on 25 July 2010, she was waiting for a
written or verbal offer to vary her Service Agreement. Maurice Choo
gave evidence at trial that Lim had agreed on 27 March 2009 to reduce
her monthly salary to $50,000. He produced his electronic diary
entry for 27 March 2009 (“the Entry”) which noted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mrs. Lim Suat Hua came to meet Dr. Maurice
Choo at Maurice Choo Clinic. She accepted the arrangement discussed
the previous day, and will submit her resignation accordingly. She
will accept a salary of $50,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Singapore
HealthPartners also rely on the minutes of the board meeting of
30 March 2009 to show that Lim had agreed to the reduction of her
salary. Item 12.7 of said minutes (“Resolution 12.7”) records the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is resolved</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That SHL [Lim] be offered a New Service
Agreement (NSA) for the period from 1 April 2009 to TOP of the project,
at a monthly basic salary of S$50,000. All other terms of the Service
Agreement shall remain the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It
is undisputed that Lim was present at the 30 March 2009 board meeting.
It is also undisputed that Lim was asked to step out of the meeting room
when the time came to discuss the matters within the purview of
the Remuneration Committee. According to the testimony of Maurice
Choo and Richard Chew, all the directors agreed to reduce Lim’s
salary to $50,000. She was then asked to rejoin the meeting where
she did not object to the reduction in salary with effect from 1 April
2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However,
Lim denies that such a resolution was validly passed. She argues
that the resolution must have been subsequently inserted into the minutes
by Maurice Choo. She claims not to have been told of the deliberations
of the board in her absence and that she did not know that such
a resolution had been passed until she received the draft minutes
on 2 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In
addition, Lim gave evidence that from May 2009 to June 2010 she did
not openly object to the reduction of her monthly salary because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     she
was waiting for the written offer from Richard Chew to know the
full terms of Singapore HealthPartners’ proposed variation to her
Service Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     her
time and mind were occupied with the sales of the medical suites
and evaluation of the tenders for the main building contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
disputes amongst the shareholders and directors had caused her great
stress and duress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On
a balance of probabilities, I am unable to find that Lim had agreed to
the variation of her monthly salary on or about 27 March 2009. I
note that the Entry recorded the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     That
there was an “arrangement” discussed the previous day;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
Lim accepted the “arrangement” and would submit her resignation
accordingly; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
Lim would accept a salary of $50,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would appear from the above that Lim’s agreement to accept
the $50,000 was part of a wider “arrangement” involving her resignation
and entering into a new service agreement one of the terms of which
was that Lim would be paid a monthly salary of $50,000. Nothing
in the Entry suggested that Lim’s Service Agreement was to be varied
in only one respect, namely, the salary. As such, the Entry did
not bear out Singapore HealthPartners’ contention that Lim had agreed
on 27 March 2009 to a reduction of her salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I
move on to consider Resolution 12.7 of the minutes of the 30 March 2009
board meeting. Even if it had been validly passed, Resolution 12.7
of the minutes of the 30 March 2009 board meeting only resolved
that Lim be offered “a New Service Agreement (NSA) for the period
from 1 April 2009 to TOP of the project at a monthly basic salary
of S$50,000”; it did not record that Lim had agreed to the said
variation. This accords with my interpretation of the Entry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     If
Lim had indeed agreed on 27 March 2009 to a reduction of her salary
as the sole variation of Lim’s Service Agreement, Maurice Choo would
have informed the board, at the 30 March 2009 board meeting, of such
agreement. Nothing to this effect appeared in exhibit P2 or in the entire
transcripts of the audio-recording of the 30 March 2009 board meeting.
Instead, Lim was required to leave the room when the time came to
discuss her Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I
also note that, at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Singapore HealthPartners
on 2 May 2009, Maurice Choo had informed shareholders that Lim had
tendered her resignation on 21 March 2009. However, under cross-examination,
Maurice Choo was forced to concede that he had misled the shareholders
at the AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For
the above reasons, it would not be safe to rely on Maurice Choo’s oral
evidence that Lim had agreed on 27 March 2009 to the variation of
her Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In
addition to the question of her salary, Lim alleged that another term
that was being considered was the issue of her tenure. Lim exhibited an
extract from the transcripts of audio-recordings of the board meeting
on 30 March 2009 (“exhibit P2”) to support her case that there was
“no consensus reached by the [b]oard on how to move forward on the
Service Agreement let alone any consensus on the revised terms”.
Lim also pointed out that exhibit P2 did not contain any discussion
of a resolution to reduce her salary. As such, Lim submits that
Resolution 12.7 “cannot be correct but must have been inserted subsequently
into the minutes” by Maurice Choo. Given my reading of the text
of Resolution 12.7, it is unnecessary for me to say anything further
in regard to its validity or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I
should perhaps add that I generally had considerable difficulty
with the evidential value of exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of
the audio-recording of the 30 March 2009 board meeting in general).
As exhibit P3 (a table of audio-recordings of board meetings comparing
the duration of such recordings with the length of the respective
meetings as shown in the minutes thereof) noted, the audio-clip
on which the transcripts were based only ran for 1 hour 18 minutes
and 59 seconds. However, the recorded duration of the meeting was
2 hours 15 minutes. It would appear that about 56 minutes of the
meeting was unrecorded. This calls into question the completeness
of exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of the audio-recording of the
30 March 2009 board meeting in general). In addition, the following board
resolutions that were recorded in the minutes of the 30 March 2009 board
meeting are also missing from the corresponding audio-recordings and
transcripts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     Resolution
12.8 that Maurice Choo and Lim are “authorized [<em>sic</em>]
to sign on behalf of the Board, the Audited Financial Statements for
the Financial Period ended 31 December 2008”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     Resolution
12.9 that “the withdrawal of Mr. Gary Yeoh as the Alternate Director
to Dato’ Tan is accepted and the withdrawal be recorded in the Company’s
Register and lodgment be made to ACRA”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     Resolution
12.9 that “the next AGM shall be held on 25 April 2009 at 2:30 PM
at Lucky Plaza, conference room”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     Resolution
12.10 that “the next BOD meeting shall be held half an hour after
the conclusion of the next AGM”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In
defending the reliability of exhibit P2, Lim noted that there were discrepancies
between the duration of the audio-recordings and the recorded duration
in the minutes for <em>all</em> the recorded
board meetings. In fact, for the board meeting on 23 May 2009, the
audio-recordings had an additional 35 minutes as compared to the
recorded duration in the minutes. The then-corporate secretary Steven
Lim offered the following reasons for the discrepancies:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     When
the board went off tangent during meetings, he would switch off
the recording;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     He
recorded approximate timings in the minutes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
recorder used was a voice-activated recorder that would automatically
stop recording until it picked up a voice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In
addition to the <em>quantitative</em> discrepancies
between the audio-recordings and the recorded duration in the minutes,
exhibit P2 was also <em>qualitatively</em> flawed.
The transcripts, in my view, do not allow me to form a clear picture
of what was discussed at the meeting. There are parts of exhibit P2
where the voices are unidentified. Further, some parts of exhibit
P2 are incomplete. The quality of the transcripts is directly related
to the quality of the audio-recordings. At trial, I struggled to
make out parts of the audio-recordings as the members of the board
often spoke simultaneously. There are also parts of the audio-recordings
which were inaudible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Given
both the quantitative discrepancies between the duration of the audio-recordings
and the recorded duration in the minutes for all the recorded meetings
and the poor quality of the transcripts and audio-recordings of
the 30 March 2009 board meeting, I am unwilling to place much weight
on exhibit P2 (and the transcripts of the audio-recording of the
30 March 2009 board meeting in general).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Estoppel Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In
the alternative, Singapore HealthPartners argues that even if Lim did
not agree to the reduction in her monthly salary, an estoppel by convention/common
assumption operates to prevent Lim from insisting that her monthly
salary should have been $60,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
law on estoppel by convention/common assumption is set out in the
case of <em>Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan
Kim Swee Augustine</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> where the Court of Appeal held
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the basis of existing authorities, for
estoppel by convention to operate, the following elements must be
present (see <em>SingTel v SCV</em> at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>; see also <em>Chitty on
Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29<sup>th</sup> Ed,
2004) vol 1 at para 3–107):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The parties must have Acted on ‘<em>an assumed
and incorrect state of fact or law</em>’ [emphasis added]
(per Bingham LJ in <em>The Vistafjord</em> [1988]
2 Lloyd’s Rep 343 at 352) in their course of dealing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The assumption must be either shared
by both parties pursuant to an agreement or something akin to an
agreement, or made by one party and acquiesced to by the other.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">It must be unjust or unconscionable
to allow the parties (or one of them) to go back on that assumption.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that an estoppel by convention
cannot arise where neither of the parties between whom the alleged
estoppel arose was aware of the facts on which the common assumption
in question was said to have been based (see <em>Chitty
on Contracts</em> vol 1 at para 3–109; <em>HIH
Casualty &amp; General Insurance v Axa Corporate Solutions</em> [2002] All ER (Comm)
1053). [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On
the evidence before me, I find that Lim’s Actions and omissions between
April 2009 and June 2010 were consistent with the presence of a shared
assumption that Lim’s salary had been reduced to $50,000. Both parties
shared and Acted on an assumed and incorrect state of fact, <em>ie</em>, that Lim had agreed or at least acquiesced
to the reduction of her monthly salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The
Actions and omissions which, I find, establish the presence of a shared
assumption, are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim
had failed to raise any objection when Maurice Choo informed shareholders
at the AGM on 2 May 2009 that Lim had agreed to her Service Agreement
being reviewed by the board;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim
did not raise any objection to being paid $50,000 per month during
the period from May 2009 to June 2010 when she was, as she claims,
still entitled to $60,000 per month. At trial, Lim conceded that she
“had many opportunities to register [her] position on the shortfall in
salary”. However, she maintained that she was “not in the frame
of mind at that time”. When pressed further, she then said that
her main concern at that point in time was the shareholder dispute
within Singapore HealthPartners. In the end, she admitted that the
issue regarding her salary had nothing to do with the shareholder
dispute and would have had no implication for the dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     during
the period from May 2009 to June 2010, Lim had co-signed the Authorisation
Letters for submission to DBS providing for herself to be paid a
monthly salary of $49,662 (her monthly salary of $50,000 less deductions
for Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and Chinese Development Assistance
Council Fund (“CDAC Fund”). In addition, Lim had prepared a revised
budget in which her salary was recorded as $50,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     lastly,
in the course of settlement negotiations in 2010 which led to the
eventual Settlement Agreement, Lim had sought compensation of $600,000
(being 12 months’ of her revised salary of $50,000). It is apparent
from the exchange of e-mails between Lim’s solicitor and the opposing
solicitor that both parties had shared and Acted on an assumed and
incorrect state of fact, <em>ie</em>, Lim
had agreed or at least acquiesced to the reduction of her monthly
salary. For instance, Lim’s solicitor, in an e-mail to the opposing
solicitor, noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[Lim’s] engagement as [Executive Director]
and her remuneration were discussed at the Board meeting. When Maurice
Choo took over as Chairman, these issues were once again tabled
to the ‘new’ Board who all approved it, save and except for her
salary which was reduced from $60,000 to $50,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In
the circumstances, I also find that it is unjust and unconscionable for
Lim to go back on the shared assumption. I agree with the passage
in <em>Credit Suisse v Borough Council of Allerdale</em> [1995]
1 Lloyd’s Rep 315 at 367 cited by counsel for Singapore HealthPartners:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The basis for that unconscionability is
that the party said to be estopped would otherwise be allowed to
adopt a position which was inconsistent with that which he had previously
led the other party to believe was common ground. There would therefore
be both inconsistency of conduct and potential prejudice from that
inconsistency which is the essence of estoppel by whatever name
it is known: See <em>Amalgamated Investment &amp;
Property Co. Ltd.</em>, sup., at p. 121 per Lord Denning,
M.R. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In
our case, as counsel for Singapore HealthPartners submits, the unconscionability
arises as Singapore HealthPartners was not given a chance to address
the issue of the alleged short-payment of Lim’s salary between May
2009 and June 2010. At trial, Lim conceded that had she complained
about her salary, Singapore HealthPartners might not have signed
the Settlement Agreement. As such, it is unconscionable for Lim
to now resile from the shared assumption and rely on her strict
legal rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For
the aforementioned reasons, I dismiss Lim’s claim that she is entitled
to $140,000 in “short-paid” salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lim’s pro-rated salary for July
2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Singapore
HealthPartners does not dispute Lim’s entitlement to a pro-rated
salary for July 2010. However, it disputes the quantum of that entitlement.
In coming to a finding as to the quantum, I am required to address
the Excess Payment Issue and the Excess Leave Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Excess Payment
Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On
or about 13 April 2009, Lim co-signed an Authorisation Letter for submission
to DBS mandating payment to herself of an amount of $59,662 (this
being the monthly salary of $60,000 less the $338 contribution to
the CPF and the CDAC Fund) for April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Given
my finding that Lim did not agree to the reduction in salary, it follows
that she did not overpay herself by $10,000 for April 2009. It was only
in May 2009 that the estoppel by convention/common assumption arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Excess Leave
Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Clause
5.1 of Lim’s Service Agreement (“Clause 5.1”) stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Appointee shall be entitled during
the continuance of this Agreement, without loss of remuneration
to thirty (30) business days leave a year (in addition to public
holidays as gazetted in Singapore) to be taken at such time or times
as may be approved by the Board. <em>The Appointee
shall not be entitled to carry forward the balance of any unconsumed
leave</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It
is undisputed that between 1 January 2010 and 25 July 2010, Lim took
27 days of leave. Singapore HealthPartners’ claims, however, that
for the period between 1 January 2010 and 25 July 2010, Lim was
only entitled to 17 pro-rated days of leave; the 30 days of leave
provided for in Clause 5.1 being for a year’s service. She had thus
taken ten days of excess leave for which she is liable to reimburse
Singapore HealthPartners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     On
the other hand, Lim argues that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     There
is no legal basis for Singapore HealthPartners’ claim to compensation
for leave taken in excess of entitlement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
27 days of leave taken by Lim by 25 July 2010 was her entitlement
under Clause 5.1; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     Singapore
HealthPartners had agreed with Lim to allow her to carry forward
her excess leave of 25.5 days from 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I
find that Singapore HealthPartners had not agreed with Lim to allow her
to carry forward her excess leave from 2008 and 2009. Lim alleged
that there was an oral agreement between Djeng and herself which
permitted her to carry forward her unconsumed leave for 2008. She
also alleged that this oral agreement was evidenced in writing by
a letter from Djeng to herself dated 31 December 2008 (“the Leave
Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     However,
I am not convinced that the Leave Letter exists. Firstly, the Leave
Letter was not mentioned in Lim’s Statement of Claim. Instead, Lim pleaded
an oral agreement. In February 2011, Lim then belatedly sought discovery
of the Leave Letter. Singapore HealthPartners explained that it had
no such document in its possession. At trial Lim omitted to call
Djeng as a witness to prove the existence of the Leave Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Secondly,
an e-mail dated 24 November 2009 sent on Lim’s behalf to the board
to request approval to carry forward her leave in 2009, made no mention
of the Leave Letter. Had the Leave Letter existed, Lim would naturally
have referred to it in the e-mail. As Lim conceded during cross-examination,
no director on the board had consented to Lim’s request. As such,
her excess leave from 2008 and 2009 was forfeited in accordance
with Clause 5.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In
my view, a term ought to be implied into the Service Agreement to allow
Singapore HealthPartners to claim against Lim for leave taken in excess
of entitlement. To hold otherwise would, <em>in
extremis</em>, allow an employee to take 30 days leave after
having served the employer for a few days, and after such leave,
to quit the employment with impunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     While
employers often allow employees to take leave in advance of entitlement,
this is done on the premise that the employee will complete that
year’s service. In Lim’s case, she took her leave entitlement in
advance without subsequently completing that year of service. It
could not have been the intention of the parties to allow Lim to
do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I
thus find that the pro-rated salary for July 2010 owed to Lim is $23,884.22,
the breakdown of which is as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Waiver, Release and Discharge
Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In
regard to Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaims, Lim asserts that
Singapore HealthPartners had “waived, released and discharged” Lim from
such claims by virtue of cl 10.7 of the Settlement Agreement (“Clause 10.7”).
Clause 10.7 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Lim] shall execute and deliver to the
Company the <b>LSH Undertaking</b> upon the
execution of this Agreement. <em>The Company and
each and every Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
releases and discharges [Lim] of and from any and all Claims which
any of them has or may have against [Lim] arising from and/or in
connection with any of the agreements, deeds, contracts, and/or
transactions referred to in the LSH Undertaking (the ‘</em><b><em>Disclosed Transactions</em></b><em>’)
and/or any Act or omission of [Lim] as director and Executive Director
of the Company with respect to the Disclosed Transactions.</em> Each
Shareholder hereby acknowledges, and irrevocably and unconditionally directs
the Company to grant the waiver, release and discharge by the Company
set out in this Clause 10.7. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The
Disclosed Transactions are set out in the LSH Undertaking in Schedule
5 of the Settlement Agreement as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the Facility Agreement, the Profit Sharing Agreement, the

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any other contract(s) or transaction(s)
which had been expressly approved pursuant to written resolutions
duly passed by the Board of Directors of the Company or referred
to in the audited accounts of the Company or disclosed to the Board
of Directors of the Company as set out in the document captioned
“Handover Contract Documents” attached to this Warranty and Undertaking.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Essentially,
the intention of Clause 10.7 was to release, waive and discharge
Lim from any claims arising from or in connection with two classes
of transactions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     Agreements,
deeds, contracts, and/or transactions referred to in the LSH Undertaking
(“the Disclosed Transactions”); and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     Any
Act or omission of LSH as director and Executive Director of the
Company with respect to the Disclosed Transactions (“acts or omissions
with respect to the Disclosed Transactions”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Singapore
HealthPartners submits that Clause 10.7 does not preclude them from
bringing any of the counterclaims against Lim as the subject matter
of the counterclaims does not fall within any of the Disclosed Transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I
will first proceed to consider whether Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaims
are covered by Clause 10.7. If so, the counterclaims fail <em>in limine</em>. If not, I will then proceed
to address the counterclaims on their merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Clause 10.7 in relation
to the alleged unauthorised trips</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   “Disclosed transactions”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Lim
gave evidence that the Thailand trip was a business trip to review the
implementation of certain hospital software (“the Amalga Software) which
Singapore HealthPartners was keen on acquiring for the Project.
On 11 March 2009, a substantial report prepared by Lim Kah Chuan
(“the Amalga Report”) was e-mailed to the board of Singapore HealthPartners. Eventually,
on 6 November 2009, Singapore HealthPartners signed a contract with
Microsoft Amalga to obtain the Amalga Software (the “Microsoft Amalga
Agreement” listed in the Handover Contract Documents). As such,
Lim argues that it is “clear from the evidence adduced that the
Thailand trip was for the purpose of understanding and acquiring
the Amalga [S]oftware for the Project and benefited [Singapore HealthPartners]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In
regard to the New Zealand trip, Lim gave evidence that it was a business
trip to study the architectural, mechanical and electrical engineering
aspects of a new hospital building in Auckland organised by Singapore
HealthPartners’ mechanical and electrical engineering consultants,
Beca Carter Holling &amp; Ferner Ltd (“Beca Carter”). Lim made this
trip together with Djeng, five representatives from DP Architects
and a representative from Beca Carter. Eventually, on 23 March 2009,
Singapore HealthPartners signed a contract with Beca Carter appointing
Beca Carter as its Mechanical and Electrical Engineers (“the M&amp;E
Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In
addition, Lim relied on the item listed as “travelling and entertainment
expenses” in the Detailed Income Statement within Singapore HealthPartners’
Reports and Financial Statements for the period from 1 July 2007
to 31 December 2008 to argue that the Thailand trip (as well as
the New Zealand trip)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [had] clearly been accounted for in
the ‘<em>audited accounts of the Company</em>’ under
the LSH Undertaking and [Singapore HealthPartners had] clearly waived,
released and discharged [Lim] in relation to any claims resulting from
these trips.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Singapore
HealthPartners submit that this argument is fallacious and that
the said item listed as “travelling and entertainment expenses”
could not be treated as reference to “contract(s) or transaction(s)
referred to in the audited accounts of the Company”. It argues that
the “travelling and entertainment expenses” in the 2008 audited
accounts were merely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a reference to a general category of
expenses incurred by [Singapore HealthPartners] for the period of
1 July 2007 to 31 December 2008 ... [and are] buried as part of
the overall travelling and entertainment expenses of [Singapore
HealthPartners]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It therefore submits that Clause 10.7 does not apply to the
alleged unauthorised trips.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In
my view, the alleged unauthorised trips could not qualify as Disclosed
Transactions merely because the Detailed Income Statement within
Singapore HealthPartners’ Reports and Financial Statements contains
an item listed as “travelling and entertainment expenses”. To my mind,
for the trips to have been “referred to in the audited accounts”,
they need to have been specifically mentioned in the Detailed Income
Statement. However, such detail was lacking in the Detailed Income
Statement. Instead, as Singapore HealthPartners argued, they were
“buried as part of the overall travelling and entertainment expenses
of [Singapore HealthPartners]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Nevertheless,
I am of the opinion that the counterclaims based on the alleged
unauthorised trips would still fail as they are “acts or omissions
of [Lim] ... with respect to the Disclosed Transactions” within
the scope of Clause 10.7.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(b)   “Acts or omissions
with respect to the Disclosed Transactions”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It
is not disputed that the Microsoft Amalga Agreement is listed under
the Handover Contract Documents and hence is one of the Disclosed Transactions
for the purposes of Clause 10.7. It is also not disputed that the M&amp;E
Agreement is a Disclosed Transaction. <em>Therefore,
even if the trips themselves are not Disclosed Transactions for
the purposes of Clause 10.7, they can still fall under Clause 10.7
if the trips were either an Act or omission of LSH as director and
Executive Director of the Company with respect to the Disclosed
Transactions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(I)   Thailand trip</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In
my view, the Thailand trip would be an Act or omission with respect
to the Microsoft Amalga Agreement, if it had any causal link to
the said agreement. According to the evidence of Singapore HealthPartners,
the board was not informed of the Thailand trip despite the fact
that there were board meetings in September, October and November
2008. In fact, the board only found out about the trip on or about
February 2008 when Tan Soon Hoe chanced upon certain documents.
It was only after the board had found out about the hitherto-undisclosed
Thailand trip that the board received the Amalga Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Singapore
HealthPartners took the position that it had found the Amalga Report
to be of no real value, and that subsequently, Maurice Choo had,
together with James Woo, undertaken the responsibility of evaluating the
viability of acquiring the Amalga Software for the Project. According
to Maurice’s Choo evidence, the Amalga Report was based on a quotation
of $9,487,000. It was only after his efforts that it obtained a
quotation of $4,406,400 from Microsoft. In effect, Maurice Choo
told the court that James Woo and he had negotiated the reduction
in the price of the Amalga Software from $9,487,000 to $4,406,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     However,
I had difficulty with the evidence of Maurice Choo in this regard.
During cross-examination, when Maurice Choo was taken through Microsoft’s
proposal in the Amalga Report where the quotation in exhibit A of
Microsoft’s proposal added up to $4,406,400, he was unable to explain why
he had taken the position that the Amalga Report was based on a quotation
for $9,487,000. Clearly, this shows that, contrary to the position taken
by Singapore HealthPartners, the Amalga Report had been of some value
to Singapore HealthPartners as it contained a competitive quotation from
Microsoft (which Maurice Choo and James Woo tried to claim credit for).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As
such, this suggests that the Thailand trip and the Amalga Report had
some bearing on the eventual signing of the Microsoft Amalga Agreement.
I thus find that the Thailand trip was taken with a view to the said
Agreement. The Thailand trip is therefore covered by Clause 10.7
as it was an Act with respect to the Microsoft Amalga Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(II)   New Zealand trip</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Similarly,
the New Zealand trip was also related to the M&amp;E Agreement signed
on 23 March 2009. Lim adduced sufficient evidence to prove that
the New Zealand trip was organised by Beca Carter and was for the
purpose of studying the architectural, mechanical and electrical engineering
aspects. For this reason, I find that the New Zealand trip was linked
to the M&amp;E Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Accordingly,
the counterclaim with regard to the unauthorised trips fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Clause 10.7 in relation
to contracts between Wizvision and Singapore HealthPartners</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Wizvision,
a company providing information technology services, had entered
into three contracts with Singapore HealthPartners:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_a"></a>(a)     An
Office/Server Desktop Solution contract signed in November 2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_b"></a>(b)     An
IT System Maintenance Support contract signed in January 2008 for
the period for the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_c"></a>(c)     An
IT System Maintenance Support contract signed for the period 1 April
2009 to 31 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Singapore
HealthPartners contend that Lim did not disclose the full extent
of her direct and indirect interests in Wizvision, in effect breaching her
obligation of disclosure under s 156(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev
Ed) (“the Act”) and under general law. At this juncture, I should state
that s 156(1) of the Act imposes a statutory duty of disclosure
on directors but otherwise has little bearing on this civil Action;
s 156(9) specifically provides that the Section is in addition to
and not in derogation of the operation of any rule of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Lim’s
interest in Wizvision comprised:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     a
17% direct stake in Wizvision;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
15.59% indirect stake in Wizvision through Hua Jie Pte Ltd; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     her
directorship of Wizvision since 7 April 2000;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Her son, Lim Kong Wee, was a director of Wizvision from 7 December 2007.
Another son, Lim Wee Kiat, had an indirect stake of 0.12% in Wizvision
through Hua Jie Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Although
under s 156(8) of the Act, for the purposes of disclosure of a director’s
interest in a transaction with the company, an interest of a member
of the director’s family is to be treated as the director’s interest,
no authority was cited to me that the position is the same under
common law. However, it is not necessary for me to decide on this
issue because, in any event, Lim failed to disclose her own indirect
interest in a 15.59% stake in Wizvision held through Hua Jie Pte
Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Lim
insists that but for an “honest oversight in not disclosing her indirect
stake in Wizvision through Hua Jie Pte Ltd”, she had provided disclosure
of her interest in Wizvision prior to Singapore HealthPartners engaging
Wizvision. In any event, Lim argues that these contracts were referred
to in the audited accounts of Singapore HealthPartners and, as such,
are “Disclosed Transactions” covered by Clause 10.7 so that no Act
or omission on her part (as a director of Singapore HealthPartners)
with respect to these contracts could found a claim by Singapore
HealthPartners against her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However,
Singapore HealthPartners points out that when the Settlement Agreement
was signed on 12 July 2010, the audited accounts only covered accounts
up till the year ended 31 December 2008. As such, Singapore HealthPartners
contends that contracts entered into or subsisting between Wizvision
and Singapore HealthPartners after 31 December 2008 are not covered
by Clause 10.7 as they are not “referred to in the audited accounts
of the Company”. Moreover, Singapore HealthPartners takes the position
that Clause 10.7 is operative only to the extent of her disclosed
interests in Wizvision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It
is trite law that a director occupies a fiduciary office. As such,
a director is not to place himself or herself in a position where
his or her duty and interest conflict. According to the learned
authors of Walter Woon on Company Law (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised
3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) (“<em>Walter
Woon on Company Law</em>”) at para 8.38, the no profit rule
posits that a fiduciary may not obtain a profit in connection with
his position without the informed consent of the person he is bound
to protect. Therefore:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... unless he has provided full disclosure
and obtained the informed consent of the company, a director who
acquires a benefit in connection with his office is accountable
to the company for that benefit. (Walter Woon on Company Law at
para 8.39).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Traditionally,
the law has always taken a very strict approach where conflicts
of interest are concerned. Lord Herschell in <em>George
Bray v John Rawlinson Ford</em> [1896] AC 44 at 51 said that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is an inflexible rule of a Court of
Equity that a person in a fiduciary position ... is not, unless
otherwise expressly provided, entitled to make a profit; he is not
allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty
conflict. It does not appear to me that this rule is, as has been
said, founded upon principles of morality. I regard it rather as
based on the consideration that, human nature being what it is,
there is a danger, in such circumstances, of the person holding
a fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than by duty,
and thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect. It has therefore
been deemed expedient to lay down this positive rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As
such, where a director has failed to make full disclosure and to obtain
the informed consent of the company, the company may seek disgorgement
of any profits that the director makes from the transaction (<em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> at para 8.42).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     However
as noted by the learned authors of <em>Walter Woon
on Company Law</em>, just as a natural person may validly
release another party from liability, a company may similarly do
so. The members of a company may release a director from his fiduciary
duty by agreement: see <em>New Zealand Netherlands
Society ‘Oranje’ Incorporated v Kuys</em> [1973] 2 All ER 1222
(Privy Council on appeal from New Zealand). The members of the company
may also ratify and adopt an Act of the directors which would otherwise
be a breach of their fiduciary duty: see <em>Walter
Woon on Company Law</em> at para 9.18 and the authorities
therein cited. <em>Walter Woon</em> concludes
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Notwithstanding <em>dicta</em> to
the contrary by some English judges, the general rule is that if
the directors have exercised their powers irregularly, or Acted without
proper authority or Acted from improper motives, they can by full and
frank disclosure of all material facts to the members obtain absolution and
forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I
am of the view that the first two contracts referred to in <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above (“the first two Wizvision
contracts”) are within the scope of Clause 10.7 since they were
“referred to in the audited accounts of the Company” for the year
ended 31 December 2008. It does not matter that the second of these
contracts, namely, the IT System Maintenance Support contract signed
in January 2008 continued to have effect beyond 31 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In
contrast, the third contract referred to in <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above,
namely, the IT System Maintenance Support contract for the period
1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 (“the third contract”) falls outside
the scope of Clause 10.7 since the latest audited accounts of Singapore
HealthPartners at the time of the Settlement Agreement were the
audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 and therefore
could not have referred to the third contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I
am also of the view that, in so far as the first two Wizvision contracts are
concerned, Clause 10.7 is effective in releasing Lim from liability
for inadequate disclosure of her interest in Wizvision to the shareholders
of Singapore HealthPartners. The Settlement Agreement containing
Clause 10.7 was signed by Singapore HealthPartners and all its shareholders. Clause
10.7 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The Company and each and every Shareholder
irrevocably and <em>unconditionally</em> waives,
releases and discharges LSH of and from any and all Claims which
any of them has <em>or may have</em> ...
Each Shareholder hereby acknowledges, and irrevocably and unconditionally
directs the Company to grant the waiver, release and discharge by
the Company set out in this Clause 10.7. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To my mind, Singapore HealthPartners, together with all its
shareholders, intended to “irrevocably and unconditionally” release
Lim from any and all claims in connection with the two Wizvision
contracts falling within the scope of Clause 10.7, even if such
claims arose out of a breach of Lim’s fiduciary duty of disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     To
begin with, it is not in evidence whether at the time the Settlement Agreement
was signed the shareholders knew of Lim’s partial failure to disclose
her interest. From Singapore HealthPartners’ case, it is obvious that,
at some point in time, Singapore HealthPartners became aware of Lim’s
undisclosed interest in Wizvision. But when did it become aware? When
Lim, in her Reply to the Defence and Counterclaim, invoked Clause 10.7,
there was no reply at all from Singapore HealthPartners. It would appear
that the latter had not thought to challenge Lim’s invocation of Clause
10.7 on the ground that there had been lack of informed consent
to the release in Clause 10.7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In
any event, the Settlement Agreement should be construed in the context
in which it was signed. From the middle of 2009, the shareholders and
directors of Singapore HealthPartners were split into two factions,
and the dispute between the two factions resulted in several arbitral
and court proceedings. Eventually, the two factions concluded that
the best way of resolving the dispute was for one side to buy the
other out on the terms of the Settlement Agreement. In this context,
it can reasonably be inferred that the intention of the parties
in signing the Settlement Agreement was to wipe the slate clean
by releasing Lim from all claims within the scope of Clause 10.7
without any qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The
wording of Clause 10.7 supports my view. Clause 10.7 states that each
and every shareholder of Singapore HealthPartners “irrevocably and <em>unconditionally</em>” releases Lim from “any
and all Claims which any of them has or <em>may
have</em>”. The release is clearly not given on the condition
that Lim had given full and frank disclosure of any breaches of
her fiduciary duty. In addition, Clause 10.7 contemplates both present
claims which the shareholders are aware of and claims which they
“may have” in the future but are currently not aware of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As
such, I am of the view that Clause 10.7 is effective in releasing
Lim from any liability to the Company arising from her failure to
disclose fully her interest in Wizvision under the first two Wizvision
contracts. Accordingly, the counterclaim with regard to the first
two Wizvision contracts fails but that with respect to the third
succeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In
summary, notwithstanding my finding that Lim did not agree to a reduction
in her monthly salary on 27 March 2009, I find that Lim is estopped
from enforcing her strict legal right to the short-paid salary from May
2009 to June 2010. As the estoppel arose only from May 2009 onwards, I
find that she did not overpay herself by $10,000 in respect of her
salary for April 2009. Singapore HealthPartners’ counterclaim in
respect of the $10,000 overpayment therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    With
regard to Lim’s claim for her pro-rated salary for July 2010, I find
that Lim had taken ten days in excess of her leave entitlement for 2010
for which Singapore HealthPartners ought to be credited with $16,438.36.
Lim’s claim is thus allowed in part in the sum of $23,884.22, together
with interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the termination of
Lim’s Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In
regard to Singapore HealthPartners’ other counterclaims, I find that
those in respect of the Thailand and New Zealand trips are within
the scope of Clause 10.7 and are therefore dismissed. In addition,
I find that Singapore HealthPartners and its shareholders had agreed
under Clause 10.7 to release and absolve Lim from any and all claims
arising from any Act or omission with respect to the first two Wizvision
contracts. Accordingly, the claim arising from Lim’s alleged failure
to disclose her interest in the first two Wizvision contracts is
dismissed. In regard to the third contract, I order an account and
inquiry before the Registrar as to Lim’s profits therefrom and payment
to Singapore HealthPartners of all sums found to be due and owing
on the taking of the account, together with interest at the rate
of 5.33% from the date of filing of the Defence and Counterclaim
herein.</p>
