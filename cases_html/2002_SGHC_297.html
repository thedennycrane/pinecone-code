<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1.

        On 24 October 2001, Singapore Cables

Manufacturers Pte Ltd ("Singapore Cables") obtained judgment against Wah

Yuen Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd ("the Company") in the sum of $1,159,457.64

with interest thereon at 6% per annum from date of writ. The Company was in financial

difficulties and did not pay the judgment debt. In December 2001, a winding-up petition

was served on the Company.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        The

Company, thereafter, applied to court under s 210 of the Companies Act for leave to

convene a meeting of its creditors for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit,

approving a Scheme of Arrangement with its creditors. Section 210(3) of the Companies Act

provides:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"If a majority in number

    representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or

    class of members present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or the

    adjourned meeting agrees to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement

    shall, if approved by order of the Court, be binding on all the creditors or class of

    creditors or on the members or class of members, as the case may be, and also on the

    company or, in the case of a company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator

    and contributories of the company."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In that application the Company

also applied for an order that all existing legal proceedings against the Company be

stayed until further order. Both applications were granted on 25 January 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        At

the meeting of creditors that was thereafter convened, the Company tendered a revised

Scheme of Arrangement. This resulted in the meeting being adjourned to give creditors time

to study the revised Scheme. At the adjourned meeting of the 92 creditors present and

voting, 75 (constituting 81.52%) voted for and 17 voted against acceptance of the revised

Scheme. The total value of the admitted claims of the 75 who voted for the revised Scheme

was $8,556,893.43 (constituting 82.26%) and the total value of the admitted claims of the

17 who voted against the revised Scheme was $1,845,841.81.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        As

the 81.52% in number and 82.26% in value had supported the revised Scheme the percentage

requirements of s 210(3) had been complied with and the Company, in this application,

sought the approval of the court to implement the revised Scheme.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        The

application was opposed by Singapore Cables. After considering the evidence adduced by

both sides and the submissions of counsel, I felt that this was a case where the

court’s approval for the revised Scheme should not be granted and accordingly

dismissed the application. Against that dismissal the Company has appealed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        The

revised Scheme envisaged an investor injecting funds into the Company for distribution to

participating creditors in exchange for the assignment to that investor of their admitted

claims. Participating creditors whose admitted claims were less than or equal to $2,000

were to be paid in full. Participating creditors whose claims were in excess of $2,000

were to be paid the greater of (i) $2,000 or (ii) an amount equal to 15% of the value of

their admitted claims. Claims by related parties and directors were to be fully

subordinated to that of the rest of the participating creditors. It was provided that

related parties and directors shall not participate in any payment envisaged under the

revised Scheme.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        In

opposing the application, Ms Sharmilee Shanmugam, who appeared for Singapore Cables,

pointed out that a considerable part of the creditor support for the revised Scheme came

from related parties, namely:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If one were to discount the

values attributable to these related parties, the creditors in value supporting the

revised Scheme ($8,556,893.43 less $5,281,087.71) would be $3,275,805.72 which worked

out to 63.96% : a figure that fell short of the 75% requirement of s 210(3).

Ms Shanmugam pointed out that if one excluded the claims of the directors and of

R&amp;N, the claim by Singapore Cables (which was in excess of $1.1 million) was by far

the largest single claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        The

main thrust of Ms Shanmugam’s opposition to the application was the fact that the

Company had been less than forthcoming in making disclosure of its accounts and in

particular in giving details of the claims by Stanley Lee and R&amp;N. She pointed out

that Singapore Cables had at the first creditors’ meeting tried to obtain details but

had merely been told that any creditor aggrieved by any lack of transparency by the

Company could make further enquiries from the Company or vote against the proposed Scheme

of Arrangement. To similar queries raised at the adjourned creditors’ meeting, the

Company’s response was that if the requisite majority for the revised Scheme was

obtained the creditor could make his representations to the court when the Company applied

for court approval of the revised Scheme.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        Ms

Shanmugam told the court that Singapore Cables had written to the Company seeking relevant

details but had not received a satisfactory response. For the purposes of this hearing,

Singapore Cables had obtained the services of an outside expert who, in a report prepared

after perusal of all the accounting documents relating to the Company that had been made

available to Singapore Cables, pointed out various discrepancies and raised various

queries on the amounts owed to directors and R&amp;N. Ms Shanmugam pointed out that the

Company in its affidavits filed in response, did not sufficiently address the queries

raised by Singapore Cables or by the expert; nor had the Company provided the supporting

documents. The reason given by Stanley Lee for this failure was that it would be costly

for the Company to employ accountants to respond to the queries.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        

Counsel for the Company, Mr Lionel Tay, at the hearing before me, did not seriously

challenge the complaint raised that the Company had not furnished sufficient particulars

of the debts due to directors and related parties. The Company’s position, as

summarised by Mr Tay, was that the Company did not have the time to provide answers to the

satisfaction of Singapore Cables. Mr Tay told the court that his clients were willing to

co-operate with Singapore Cables and suggested that the court sanction the revised Scheme

but grant Singapore Cables the right to appoint a firm of accountants to liaise with the

Company on the information they sought. Mr Tay submitted that if, as a consequence,

Singapore Cables came across any information that suggested any impropriety, Singapore

Cables would be entitled to take whatever action it deemed fit.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        Mr

Tay did not dispute that the related party debts amounted to 61.72% of the total unsecured

debts of the Company. He submitted, however, that this high percentage did not give

the related parties any unfair advantage as their debts were subordinated to the debts of

all other unsecured creditors. He further submitted that as s 210 of the Companies Act did

not draw any distinction between related party debts and other debts, no such distinction

ought to be drawn. The mere fact a creditor was related did not, he submitted, by itself

and without evidence of wrongdoing, suggest that such creditor was acting mala fide.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        The

opposing creditors in this case were owed a sum of $1,195,943,06. Under the revised

Scheme, they would be paid 15% of this sum, ie $179,391.46, in full settlement and

thereafter the Company could continue to operate. This, Ms Shanmugam submitted, would be

for the benefit of the related parties and to the detriment of the opposing creditors. Ms

Shanmugam submitted that the fact that the debts of the directors and related parties were

subordinated to the debts of the other creditors was of no solace to the opposing

creditors. If the revised Scheme was approved, the Company would have got rid of the

opposing creditors by paying them a nominal sum and without producing proper accounts to

show why the payment was so little.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        The

fact that the claims of the related parties were subordinated to the claims of other

creditors was, in my view, not an adequate answer to the complaint by Singapore Cables

that the Company had not been sufficiently transparent about the circumstances under which

the related party debts arose. This was particularly so in the light of the fact that

audited accounts of the Company for the relevant periods were not available.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        

Stanley Lee was the managing director of the Company and a 70% shareholder of the Company.

He was also the managing director and 90% shareholder of R&amp;N. Although it is true that

s 210 does not draw any distinction between third party creditors and related party

creditors, it would, in my view, only be fair (especially in cases where the required

creditor support was obtained through the exercise of the related party votes) that the

Company made full disclosure of all relevant documents so that the bona fides of the

transactions could be subjected to scrutiny. For the creditors to evaluate the revised

Scheme and for the court to approve the revised Scheme there needs to be transparency in

relation to the Company’s accounts. Failure to provide relevant accounting details

would place third party creditors at a disadvantage which they would not be under if the

Company were wound up and a liquidator appointed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        Ms

Shanmugam, in support of her submissions, relied on the case of <i>Re Halley’s

Departmental Store Pte</i> [1996] 1 SLR 70. The facts of that case were broadly similar to

the facts here and I noted that G.P. Selvam J. had, in that case, declined to grant the

approval of the court required under s 210(3).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        In

the circumstances of the present case, I was of the view that the court ought not to grant

its approval to the revised Scheme. I therefore dismissed the application with costs.</font></p>
