<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Cur Adv Vult</strong></font></em></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. This is the second appeal arising out

of an assessment of the damages sustained by the plaintiffs when the defendants breached

their contract to sell the plaintiffs 24 pieces of heavy machinery. At the first

assessment, the plaintiffs were awarded damages in the sum of $612,000 being the loss of

the profit that they would have earned from sub-sales of the 24 machines. When I heard the

defendants’ appeal against this award, I allowed it on the basis that the plaintiffs

had failed to mitigate their damages in respect of 18 of the machines. I remitted the

matter back to the Assistant Registrar to assess the plaintiffs’ damages in respect

of the remaining six machines in respect of which no mitigation had been possible. The

background of the matter and my reasons are contained in my judgment dated 6 May 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The second assessment took place in

June 2000. After considering written submissions from the parties, the Assistant Registrar

awarded the plaintiffs a sum of $192,150 in damages and interest thereon at 6% p.a. from

the date of judgment. The defendants were not satisfied with this award. They lodged an

appeal asking for the decision of the Assistant Registrar to be set aside and replaced

either by an order that the plaintiffs were entitled to only nominal damages (or no

damages at all) or alternatively, that they be paid such other reasonable damages as the

court considered just. They also asked that the costs of the appeal and the assessment be

paid to the defendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Reasons for decision below</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. In making her award, the Assistant

Registrar stated that the fact that it may be difficult to compute the amount of damages

payable in a given case does not mean that no damages should be awarded at all. The court

does not, however, simply make a guess at what the amount of damages should be. She

considered that the paramount matter to be assessed was whether, based on the available

evidence, on the balance of probabilities, the party claiming the damages did suffer them.

In the present case, she came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs’ mode of

calculation of loss of profit as set out in their written submission was convincing and

would be accepted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. In their submissions, the plaintiffs

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. It should be noted that the purchase

price ascribed to each machine by the plaintiffs was not the exact price which they had

contracted to pay the defendants for that machine. The prices were taken from an offer

which the plaintiffs had made to PT Karimun Granite (‘PTKG’) for all 24

machines. In their offer, the plaintiffs had priced each machine individually.

Subsequently, negotiations took place between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the

actual owners of the machine, and the defendants made the plaintiffs a counter offer for

all 24 machines at a lump sum price of $438,000 which was $10,000 more than the total

which the plaintiffs would have paid if they had bought all the machines at the prices

specified in their offer to PTKG.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. In their submissions, the plaintiffs

went on to point out that they had subsequently sold the six machines to three parties

namely Heng Ann Engineering Pte Ltd (‘Heng Ann’) (items 4, 5, 6 and 15), K.S.

Chin Construction Sdn Bhd (item 13) and D C Han Corporation Sdn Bhd (item 22). The

plaintiffs’ contract with Heng Ann provided for a lump sum price of $210,000 for the

four machines mentioned and a fifth machine, item 16 of the defendants’ offer, which

was a CAT 130G Motor Grader (Serial No. 12W00446) and which the plaintiffs had priced at

$5,000 in their offer to PTKG. Further, item 22 had been sold to D C Han Corporation Sdn

Bhd for $90,000 while item 13 had been sold to K.S. Chin Construction Sdn Bhd for $15,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. The plaintiffs argued that the total

cost of the six machines to them would have been $111,350 whereas the total proceeds of

their sub-sales would have been $315,000. This meant their loss of profit was $203,650.

The plaintiffs conceded, however, that that sum included the profit which would have been

made for item 16 which was not one of the six machines for which damages had been allowed.

They therefore had to deduct the profit made on item 16. The plaintiffs did this by

pointing out that they had offered $5,000 for item 16 and it had been valued by their

valuer at $15,000 whereas the defendants’ valuer had valued it at $10,000. They

submitted that a fair approach would be to split the difference between the two valuations

and value the item at $12,500. On that basis, they would have earned a profit of $7,500

from item 16.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The plaintiffs admitted that they had

agreed to pay the defendants an extra $10,000 for all 24 machines. They agreed that this

extra $10,000 would have to be reflected as part of their purchase price and submitted

that the way to do it would be to take the proportion of the $10,000 that the total cost

of the six machines ($111,350) bore to the total cost of the 24 machines ($428,000) and

add this to the cost of the six machines. They worked out that the six machines cost

approximately 25% of the total cost of the 24 machines and therefore proposed that a sum

of $2,500 be added to the cost of the six machines bringing that total to $113,850.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. The plaintiffs went on to consider the

cost of transporting the six machines from Indonesia to Singapore. They would have needed

two barges at $3,000 per barge to transport the 24 machines and they therefore calculated

the proportionate cost of transporting six machines would have been 25% of the total cost

of $6,000, ie $1,500.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. The plaintiffs submitted that the

final figure due to them as loss of profit was therefore:</font></p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The defendants’ arguments</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The defendants made the same arguments

before me as they had before the Assistant Registrar. They contended that there had not

been sufficient evidence before the Assistant Registrar to allow Her Honour to make an

intelligent award. They further submitted that the plaintiffs were entitled to either nil

or nominal damages because of the insufficiency of evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The defendants had four points in

support of their submission. These were:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) the four machines which the plaintiffs

  had allegedly resold to Heng Ann were sold on a lump sum basis together with one other

  machine with no individual price being allocated to any of these machines. The

  plaintiffs’ resale price to Heng Ann could not therefore be used to calculate the

  loss of profit that the plaintiffs sustained for those four machines; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) the defendants had offered to sell the

  plaintiffs the 24 machines for a lump sum price of $438,000. They did not specify the

  individual prices of the six machines. The plaintiffs had accepted the lump sum offer and

  therefore they could not and had not shown what the cost prices of the six machines were

  so as to enable a calculation of loss of profits;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) the defendants submitted, on the

  authority of <i>Victoria Laundry v Newman Industries Ltd </i>[1949] 2 KB 528, that the

  court would not grant extraordinary loss of profit or lucrative contracts, but only usual

  and ordinary amounts and that in this case the plaintiffs’ loss of profit was

  extraordinary because:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) the plaintiffs’ resale prices

    were excessive in the light of the actual and real transacted prices between the

    plaintiffs and the defendants and between the defendants and their sub-buyers and also in

    the light of the PSA auction price for 52 machines;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) the report of the plaintiffs’

    surveyor could not be used to substantiate the value of the six machines as it was not

    clear on what basis he had valued them except for the words ‘estimated open market

    value’ under which he inserted the figures; and</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) alternatively, there was no valid

  subcontract between the plaintiffs and Heng Ann and therefore no basis to claim any loss

  of profits for the four machines involved in that alleged subcontract.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Reasoning</font><i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Cost price of the six machines</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. In my judgment, the defendants’

contention that there was no way of determining the cost price of the six machines because

they had offered a lump sum price for all 24 machines was a disingenuous and specious one.

The defendants well knew how much the plaintiffs were initially willing to pay for each of

the 24 machines since the defendants were privy to the offer that had been made by the

plaintiffs to PTKG. The fact that the defendants chose not to ascribe an individual price

to each machine when they made their own offer to the plaintiffs and simply raised the

total amount payable by a round $10,000 does not mean that the cost of the individual

machines to the plaintiffs could not be ascertained. The very fact that the difference

between the total offered by the plaintiffs and that asked for by the defendants was only

$10,000 indicates that the defendants had no real difficulty with the prices ascribed to

the machines by the plaintiffs but simply wanted slightly more money. Even though the

plaintiffs’ offer was not made to the defendants, if the plaintiffs had gone ahead

and accepted the 18 machines which were still available to mitigate their loss, it would

have been difficult for them to argue that they could acquire those machines for anything

less than the amounts offered to PTKG for the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. In my opinion, the notional cost to

the plaintiffs of the six machines was properly worked out by the plaintiffs in their

submissions by using first, the individual figures contained in the plaintiffs’ offer

to PTKG and second, adding to those a proportion of the extra $10,000 asked for by the

defendants for all 24 machines. I agree that the apportionment of the $10,000 between the

six machines and the other 18 machines would be effected reasonably by adopting the method

submitted by the plaintiffs ie taking the proportion which the cost of those six machines

bore to the cost of the other 18. The cost of the six machines would therefore be the

prices set out in the plaintiffs’ offer plus the additional sum of $2,500 giving a

total of $113,850.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Sub-sale prices of the machines </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. In respect of two out of the six

machines, the intended resale prices do not pose a problem because these machines were the

subject of separate sales and were individually priced. Determining the sale price of the

other four machines is, however, more complicated because these were sold to Heng Ann as

part of a parcel of five machines for a lump sum price of $210,000. I do not accept,

however, the defendants’ submission that because of the lump sum nature of the

sub-sale, it is not possible at all to make a reasonable estimation of the profit which

the plaintiffs would have earned in respect of the four relevant machines.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. This is because there is sufficient

evidence to indicate what the value of the fifth machine was and once that value is

subtracted from the lump sum the remaining figure can be taken as the aggregate value of

the four machines in question. It is not necessary to determine the value of each of those

machines separately. I should note here that I do not agree with the plaintiffs’

method of calculation which was simply to deduct the profit they thought they would have

made on the fifth machine from their total profit because this method involved

double-counting. The total figure which they would have received in respect of the fifth

machine had to be deducted from the lump sum price and not only the estimated profit of

that machine.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. The fifth machine included in the sale

to Heng Ann was a motor grader bearing serial no. 12W00446 which appeared as item 16 of

the defendants’ offer to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had originally priced this

item at $5,000. At the original assessment, both parties produced valuation reports in

respect of all the machines. Both valuers gave evidence. The plaintiffs’ valuer

valued the motor grader at $15,000 whereas the defendants’ valuer valued it at

$10,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. The plaintiffs in their submissions

argued that the resale price of the motor grader should be the average of the two

valuations. Since, however, it was the plaintiffs who had the onus of showing at what

price they were reselling each machine, I do not think that they were entitled to simply

take this average. Instead, the higher figure should be used as this would be,

theoretically, the maximum amount a third party would be willing to pay for the motor

grader. The plaintiffs, having lumped this machine together with the others, should not be

entitled in their quest for compensation to calculate its value at less than the

theoretical maximum. If they were permitted to do so, there would be a danger of

over-compensation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. On this basis, the resale price of the

four machines to Heng Ann would be $195,000 being $210,000 less $15,000 (the maximum

possible resale price of the motor grader). When this figure is added to the $90,000 and

$15,000 that the plaintiffs received for the items sold to K.S. Chin Construction and D C

Han Corporation, the plaintiffs would have received a total of $300,000 rather than the

amount of $315,000 which they used as the basis of their calculation for loss of profit.

If you deduct from $300,000 the cost price of the six machines ie $113,850, the gross loss

of profit would be $186,150. The plaintiffs’ evidence was that they would have had to

hire two barges to transport all 24 machines. The correct deduction for transport costs

would, however, have been $3,000 and not $1,500 as there was no evidence that the

plaintiffs could simply have hired half the space on one barge rather than one whole boat

to move the six machines. Thus the net loss of profit would be $183,150.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. The figure of $183,150 could, however,

only be awarded to the plaintiffs as damages if it was accepted that first, the

plaintiffs’ sub-sales were genuine transactions, and secondly, that the profits that

the plaintiffs would have made on these sales were not excessive or unreasonable. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Were the sub-sales genuine

transactions?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. As pointed out in para 6 above, the

plaintiffs’ stand was that they had on-sold the six machines to three different

parties. The defendants did not specifically challenge the authenticity of the sub-sale

contracts made between the plaintiffs and K.S. Chin Construction Sdn Bhd and between the

plaintiffs and D C Han Corporation Sdn Bhd. They concentrated their efforts on the

sub-contract between the plaintiffs and Heng Ann and submitted that the glaring

contradictions in the testimony of the plaintiffs’ witnesses militated against a

finding that a firm contract existed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. In support of their stand, the

plaintiffs called one Mr Pek Choon Heng, who affirmed that he was the managing director of

Heng Ann. Mr Pek testified that on or about 2 December 1998, Heng Ann had entered into an

agreement with the plaintiffs to buy five units of heavy machinery for $210,000 from the

plaintiffs. This contract had been concluded after Mr Pek had inspected the said machines

and negotiated with one Mr Lenggawa acting on behalf of the plaintiffs. The witness

referred to a letter dated 2 December 1998 from the plaintiffs to Heng Ann whereby the

plaintiffs confirmed the sale of the five machines to Heng Ann at the said price. This

letter was annexed to the witness’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and at the top of

the letter there was a printed endorsement showing that it had been received by Heng

Ann’s fax machine at about 9 o’clock in the morning of 8 December 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. The witness went on to state that

during the negotiations with Mr Lenggawa, he had made it clear that Heng Ann was buying

the machines in order to resell them. Further, as the plaintiffs were Indonesians, they

had appointed a Mr Christopher Choy who traded as Trade Castle International to handle the

financing on their behalf. Thus, upon confirmation of the purchase, Heng Ann had paid the

sum of $30,000 as deposit for the machines to Trade Castle International. Heng Ann’s

cheque for this amount was exhibited and it was shown to be dated 9 December 1998.

Subsequently, around 18 December 1998, Mr Pek had been informed by Mr Choy that the

plaintiffs would not be able to deliver the five machines to Heng Ann.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. Mr Lenggawa Lautan, a director of the

plaintiff company, did not give evidence at the assessment although he filed two

affidavits of evidence-in-chief. The plaintiffs called only one officer, Madam Wiwik

Wahyuningsih, their chairman, to testify on the damages that they had sustained by reason

of the breach of the contract. In her affidavit, she stated that representatives from Heng

Ann had visited the quarry on a few occasions in October and November 1998. On 16 October

1998, Heng Ann had made an offer to the plaintiffs to purchase five pieces of machinery.

Once the plaintiffs had secured their own contract with the defendants for the purchase of

these machines, they had written to Heng Ann to confirm the sale of the five items for a

lump sum of $210,000. There had, however, been some subsequent negotiations and it was

only on 8 December 1998 that the plaintiffs’ agent in Singapore, Trade Castle

International, had sent a letter confirming the terms of the contract. The next day, Heng

Ann had made a part payment of the purchase price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. The defendants pointed out various

areas where they considered cross-examination had elicited significant discrepancies

between the evidence of Mr Pek and that of Madam Wiwik. First, there was a difference of

view as to when the contract between Heng Ann and the plaintiffs had come into existence.

At one point, Mr Pek said that an oral agreement was made on his third visit to the quarry

on 27 October 1998 and, at another, he said that plaintiffs had committed themselves to

sell the machines to Heng Ann on 16 October 1998. Madam Wiwik denied this. She was shown a

copy of Heng Ann’s letter to the plaintiffs dated 16 October 1998 whereby they stated

that they were pleased to confirm the purchase of the five machines in question for

$210,000 and asked for the plaintiffs’ invoice. Her position was that the plaintiffs

had not accepted this offer at first because they had wanted $225,000 for the machines.

Finally, they agreed to Heng Ann’s price but in their letter of 2 December 1998, had

asked for a downpayment of 30% to be made within a week of the purchase order and 70% to

be made on delivery. Heng Ann had not agreed to this which had led to further negotiations

and it was only on 8 December that the plaintiffs had accepted Heng Ann’s terms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. The defendants then pointed out that

Mr Pek had said that when he went to inspect the machines at the quarry, he had been alone

and escorted only by Mr Lenggawa whereas Madam Wiwik had testified that Mr Pek had been

accompanied by a friend and escorted by both Mr Lenggawa and herself. Then Mr Pek

testified that the price of $210,000 had been offered to him by the plaintiffs whereas

Madam Wiwik asserted that the first offer of that price had been made by Mr Pek. The two

witnesses also did not agree on whether Heng Ann had been informed that the sale was

subject to the ability of the plaintiffs to obtain export permits for the machines.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. I do not agree that these

discrepancies indicate that there was no genuine contract between the plaintiffs and Heng

Ann. It was clear from the documents produced that there had been an interest expressed in

the machines by Heng Ann from as early as October 1998 and that the plaintiffs had

eventually agreed to sell the machines to Heng Ann at the price proposed by Heng Ann

itself. I have no doubt that Heng Ann had sent out its offer on 16 October 1998 and that

the plaintiffs’ acceptance was sent out, at the latest, on 8 December when the issue

of the payment terms had been resolved. Small factual discrepancies cannot take away from

the underlying truth which was that a contract between the two existed and that this

contract predated the defendants’ breach. It should also be noted that Heng

Ann’s interest was adverse to the plaintiffs in one respect and that is that Heng Ann

would not want its contract to be subject to the obtaining of export permits as such a

term might impact on Heng Ann’s ability to recover damages from the plaintiffs for

their non-performance. This would account for one of the more important discrepancies

between the testimony of the two witnesses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. The Assistant Registrar who had the

benefit of observing the witnesses did not accept the defendants’ submissions on the

weight of the evidence. She obviously found the witnesses to be truthful on the basic

point in issue ie the authenticity of the sub-sale. Having studied the evidence, I can

find no reason to differ from that finding.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Was the plaintiffs’ loss of

profits excessive?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. In my first judgment on this case, I

cited a passage from <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (17<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1997) which dealt

with the recovery of damages on the basis of a lost sub-sale. It is apposite to quote para

846 of that authority again. It says:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘846. Where damages are allowed for

  loss of profit on a resale of which the seller knew the actuality or the probability, he

  will not be liable for an exceptional loss of profits unless he has been informed of the

  details of the sub-contracts and only then if he can be said to have taken the risk of

  such loss on his shoulders. This appears from the speeches in <i>Hall v Pim</i>. Lord

  Dunedin said: "The contracts … must be contracts in accordance with the market,

  not extravagant and unusual bargains." And Lord Shaw said: "It is not suggested

  that these prices were out of the ordinary course of business. Had this been so, different

  considerations might quite well have arisen." Thus in <i>Household Machines v Cosmos

  Exporters</i>, where the seller knew of the plaintiff’s intention to resell but did

  not know the details of the sub-contract, Lewis J. did not award the plaintiff the 12 per

  cent. by which the sub-contract price was higher than the contract price, but gave only

  ten per cent. Similarly, in <i>Coastal International Trading v Maroil</i> where the

  sub-contract, of which the defendants were fully aware, contained unusual terms rendering

  the plaintiffs’ profit under it unreasonable and such as would not have been within

  the contemplation of the parties, the profits awarded to the plaintiffs was arrived at

  after eliminating the extravagant effect of the unusual terms.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. The defendants submitted that the

profits which the plaintiffs would have made from their sub-sales, in particular that to

Heng Ann, were excessive. They relied on the valuation made by their valuer Mr Tiang and

also on the actual transacted resale prices obtained by the defendants themselves after

the termination of the contract with the plaintiffs. They further submitted that the

plaintiffs’ valuation report was unreliable because it purported to give an estimated

‘open market’ value for each machine and I had ruled that there was no

‘available market’ for the machines concerned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. In my view, neither the valuation

report by the plaintiffs’ valuer nor that by the defendants’ valuer is of very

much assistance in ascertaining whether the plaintiffs’ resale prices were excessive.

As I stated in my previous judgment, the evidence was that these machines were unique

specimens and it was not possible in Singapore to find similar machines readily available

for purchase so as to be able to obtain evidence as to the market price of the machines.

Instead, the evidence appears to be that the prices at which the machines could be sold

would be very much a question of supply and demand at the time of each individual sale and

would also depend on the contacts which the seller had with companies or persons who were

interested in acquiring machines of this kind. The defendants’ valuer rested his

valuation, to some extent, on the prices fetched by other machines sold by auction.

Unfortunately, insufficient details of these sales were given to enable either the

Assistant Registrar or myself to determine whether the machines sold there were of similar

types to those involved in this case or whether the same were in working order or required

repairs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. The defendants also relied on the

sub-sale prices they had obtained from third parties for these 24 machines. Whilst they

had contracted to sell these machines to the plaintiffs for $438,000, after the contract

was breached, they were only able to collect a total of $388,200 from their resales. They

argued that this showed that the plaintiffs could not have made the profits they claimed

to have made from their resale contracts and that the plaintiffs’ valuer’s

report, since it showed the value of the machines to be approximately the same as the

plaintiffs’ resale prices, was obviously wrong.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. I have two comments in this

connection. First, the Assistant Registrar heard the evidence of all the sub-buyers at the

first assessment. When she made her award, she made it on the basis of the sub-sale

contracts and therefore must have found those sub-purchasers to be truthful witnesses and

their contracts to be genuine ones. Secondly, whatever may be the position vis--vis the

18 machines which the plaintiffs refused to take delivery of, in respect of the six

machines which are the subject of the present appeal, it is clear that the defendants

themselves were able to sell these machines for much more than they had, notionally,

contracted to sell them to the plaintiffs for. Thus, it would seem that the six machines

in question were the best, ie most saleable, of the bunch.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. The defendants were not able to

deliver these six machines to the plaintiffs because PTKG wanted to buy them instead and

refused to allow them to be exported. The defendants then sold these six machines to PTKG

for $180,000 which means that they received $66,150 more than they would have received

from the plaintiffs for the same. This was a profit of approximately 58%. The plaintiffs

on the other hand would have made a profit of approximately 260% if their sales to Heng

Ann and the other two sub-purchasers had gone through. By most standards, this would seem

to be an exceptional and unusual profit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. I have come to the conclusion that, in

the special circumstances of this case, the profit that the plaintiffs would have earned

from the resale of the six machines should not be considered exceptional and unusual. This

is because the sales were ‘one-off’ transactions. There was no available market

in Singapore where persons wanting such machines could easily find them or determine what

a normal resale profit would amount to. There was, however, obviously a demand for such

machines which was evidenced not only by the plaintiffs’ own purchase of the machines

since the plaintiffs themselves had no physical use for the machines and bought them

solely for the purposes of trade but also by the defendants’ ability to resell the

machines rejected by the plaintiffs and by the various sub-sales concluded by the

plaintiffs themselves. The profit which could be gained in such a situation depended on

market knowledge and matching the right machine with the right purchaser. Since there was

no competition in terms of supply, the plaintiffs were able to ask for high prices for the

machines once they had located persons who needed them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36. It is also significant that PTKG was

willing to compensate the defendants for the loss of the sale to the plaintiffs by paying

the defendants a premium of 58% even though they were well aware of the prices that the

plaintiffs had offered and even though there was an on-going relationship between the

defendants and PTKG which allowed PTKG to impose their will in respect of the sale of

these six machines and force the defendants to break their contract with the plaintiffs or

any other person who wanted to buy the machines.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37. In the result, the plaintiffs are

awarded damages of $183,150 with interest thereon as previously ruled. Although the award

is slightly smaller than the sum assessed by the Assistant Registrar, the difference has

arisen from slight adjustments in the calculation and not because the defendants have

succeeded in any of the main points they have argued. Accordingly, the defendants have

substantially failed on this appeal although the order to be made will vary the award of

damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Costs</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38. Subsequent to making my decision on

the appeal against the first assessment, I ordered (on 29 June 2000) that the costs of

that appeal be awarded to the defendants and the costs of assessment and re-assessment to

be awarded to the plaintiffs as one set of costs. After the re-assessment took place, the

Assistant Registrar made an order to similar effect ie that the costs of the assessment be

agreed or taxed together with the costs of the assessment as one set of costs. In the

defendants’ notice of appeal dated 4 July 2000 and filed in respect of the decision

on the re-assessment, the defendants asked that the costs of the appeal and the

re-assessment be paid to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39. As far as the costs of the

re-assessment are concerned, the defendants cannot, on this appeal, change the decision

that I made on costs on 29 June 2000. If they were dissatisfied with that decision, their

remedy was to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The order made by the Assistant Registrar on

costs after she conducted the re-assessment was not an independent order but essentially a

reiteration of what I had ordered. It could not be the subject of an appeal to the Judge

in chambers. It is therefore not necessary for me to deal with this aspect of the notice

of appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40. As far as the costs of this appeal are

concerned, since the plaintiffs have succeeded substantially, I award them 90% of their

costs as taxed.</font></p>
