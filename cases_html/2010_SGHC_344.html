<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These were applications for security for costs
                    against the plaintiffs. Having failed before the assistant registrar
                    (“the AR”), the first defendant filed Registrar’s Appeal
                    No 234 of 2010 (“RA 234/2010”) appealing against the
                    AR’s decision not to award security for costs. The fifth and sixth
                    defendants also applied under Summons No 2961 of 2010
                    (“Sum 2961/2010”) for security for costs against the
                    plaintiffs. Both RA 234/2010 and Sum 2961/2010 were fixed to be heard
                    together before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing submissions from all the relevant
                    parties on 29 September 2010, I gave a brief oral judgment on
                    12 October 2010 awarding security for costs against the plaintiffs, thus
                    allowing the appeal in RA 234/2010 and the application in
                    Sum 2961/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 15 October 2010, counsel for the
                    plaintiffs wrote in requesting for further arguments. This was followed by a
                    letter dated 18 October 2010 from counsel for the fifth and sixth
                    defendants and another letter in reply the following day from counsel for the
                    plaintiffs, who also sought clarification of my orders made on 12 October
                    2010. I heard parties’ further arguments on 26 October 2010. Despite
                    the strenuous arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs, I was not persuaded to
                    alter my earlier decision granting security for costs against the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As these proceedings concerned the interesting
                    issue of whether a plaintiff can be ordinarily resident both within and out of
                    the jurisdiction for the purpose of ordering security for costs against him (and
                    if so, whether such security should be ordered) and in order to provide the
                    clarification sought by the plaintiffs, I now render in writing the grounds for
                    my judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs commenced Suit No 89 of 2010
                    (“the Suit”) against the first to ninth defendants in February
                    2010. The tenth defendant Magnus Energy Group Ltd (“MEGL”) and the
                    eleventh defendant Antig Investments Pte Ltd (“Antig”) were added
                    by way of an amendment to the statement of claim on 26 August 2010. Antig
                    is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEGL. The Suit related to a shares sale and
                    purchase agreement dated 23 November 2004 (“the 1st
                    S&amp;PA”) and two other share sale agreements dated 12 July 2007
                    (“the 2nd S&amp;PA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under the 1st S&amp;PA between the plaintiffs
                    and Antig, the plaintiffs agreed to sell in aggregate 72% of the shares in an
                    Indonesian company PT Deefu Chemical Indonesia (“PT Deefu”)
                    to Antig for US$18m (“the Sale Price”), which was to be paid by
                    Antig in the form of cash and shares in MEGL. The 1st S&amp;PA was subsequently
                    varied by four supplemental agreements and a letter dated 31 May 2006 from
                    Antig to the plaintiffs. The net effect of these variations to the payment terms
                    of the 1st S&amp;PA was that, of the Sale Price, US$6m was to be paid in cash to
                    the first plaintiff and the remaining US$12m was to be paid to the second and
                    fourth defendants in cash as well as shares in MEGL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Under the 2nd S&amp;PA, the following
                    transactions were effected:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first plaintiff sold his 5%
                        interest in another Indonesian company PT Batubaraselares Sapta (the
                        remaining 95% of which is owned by PT Deefu) to the seventh defendant for
                        US$336,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The first plaintiff sold his remaining 28% interest in PT Deefu to the
                        eighth defendant for US$1.68m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       To date, pursuant to the 1st S&amp;PA as
                    modified, the plaintiffs have received directly the sum of approximately US$5.5m
                    while the second and fourth defendants have received US$12m in total. The
                    plaintiffs’ claims in the Suit are made on the grounds of, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Fraudulent misrepresentation (as
                        against the first and fifth defendants and MEGL) in that the former two
                        defendants (acting as agents for MEGL) had fraudulently misrepresented to
                        the first plaintiff that the Sale Price would be paid to the plaintiffs. In
                        this regard, the first plaintiff alleged that he was not well-versed in
                        English and that his understanding of the terms of the 1st S&amp;PA was
                        based on what the fifth defendant had told him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Unlawful means conspiracy in respect of the 1st
                        S&amp;PA as against the first to sixth defendants and/or MEGL for conspiring
                        to cause the plaintiffs to enter into the 1st S&amp;PA on the basis that the
                        Sale Price would be paid to the first plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Resulting trust and/or constructive
                        trust and/or moneys had and received against the various defendants for
                        moneys that they had wrongfully received in relation to the 1st and 2nd
                        S&amp;PAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 27 May 2010, the AR dismissed the first
                    defendant’s application in Summons No 1720 of 2010
                    (“Sum 1720/2010”) for security for costs, being of the view
                    that the first plaintiff is ordinarily resident in Singapore. While he also held
                    that the second and third plaintiffs are nominal plaintiffs, he was minded to
                    apply the principle elucidated in <em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)
                        (“<em>White Book</em>”) at
                    para 23/3/10 that no order for security for costs will be made if there is
                    a co-plaintiff resident within the jurisdiction. The first defendant filed
                    RA 234/2010 against this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applications for security for costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Security for costs may be ordered against a
                    plaintiff under O 23 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Security for costs of action, etc.
                            (O. 23, r. 1)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1</b>. —(1) Where, on the application of a defendant to an
                        action or other proceeding in the Court, it appears to the Court
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">that the plaintiff is ordinarily resident out
                                of the jurisdiction;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">that the plaintiff (not being a plaintiff who
                                is suing in a representative capacity) is a nominal plaintiff who is
                                suing for the benefit of some other person and that there is reason
                                to believe that he will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant
                                if ordered to do so;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court
                        thinks it just to do so, it may order the plaintiff to give such security
                        for the defendant’s costs of the action or other proceeding as it
                        thinks just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court’s jurisdiction to order security for costs against a
                    plaintiff is founded on at least one of the four factual conditions listed in
                    O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>)–(<em>d</em>). Once one of those conditions is satisfied, the court may
                    exercise its discretionary power to order the plaintiff to give security for the
                    defendant’s costs if it thinks it just to do so having regard to all the
                    circumstances of the case. In this regard, factors commonly taken into account
                    include whether the plaintiff’s claim is <em>bona
                        fide</em>, whether it has a reasonably good prospect of success, as
                    well as whether the application for security was being used oppressively with a
                    view to stifling a genuine claim (see, <em>eg</em>,
                        <em>Sir Lindsay Parkinson &amp; Co Ltd v Triplan
                        Ltd</em> [1973] QB 609 <em>per</em>
                    Lord Denning MR at 626-627, cited with approval in <em>Creative
                        Elegance (M) Sdn Bhd v Puay Kim Seng</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 112 at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ordinarily resident out of jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Natural and ordinary meaning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The words “ordinarily resident”
                    should be given their natural and ordinary meaning; the expression is not a term
                    of art with any technical or special meaning. Thus, in <em>Regina
                        v Barnet London Borough Council, Ex parte Nilish Shah</em> [1983]
                    2 AC 309 (“<em>Shah</em>”), the
                    House of Lords held that (at 343):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... ‘ordinarily resident’ refers to a man’s abode in a
                        particular place or country which he has adopted voluntarily and for settled
                        purposes as part of the regular order of his life for the time being,
                        whether of short or of long duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is the state of mind of the “propositus” that is
                    paramount in determining ordinary residence. Not only should the place of
                    residence be adopted voluntarily (as opposed to enforced presence in a
                    particular jurisdiction by reason of kidnapping or imprisonment <em>etc</em>), there should also be a degree of settled purpose.
                    In this regard, in his Lordship’s judgment in <em>Shah</em>, Lord Scarman observed that (at 344):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The purpose may be one; or there may be several. It may be specific or
                        general. All that the law requires is that there is a settled purpose. This
                        is not to say that the ‘propositus’ intends to stay where he is
                        indefinitely; indeed his purpose, while settled, may be for a limited
                        period. Education, business or profession, employment, health, family, or
                        merely love of the place spring to mind as common reasons for a choice of
                        regular abode. And there may well be many others. All that is necessary is
                        that the purpose of living where one does has a sufficient degree of
                        continuity to be properly described as settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In arriving at its conclusions, the House of
                    Lords in <em>Shah</em> relied to some extent on two tax
                    cases reported in 1928 which sought to elucidate the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the words “ordinary residence”, namely, <em>Levene v Commissioners of Inland Revenue</em>
                    [1928] AC 217 and <em>Commissioners of Inland Revenue v
                        Lysaght</em> [1928] AC 234. <em>Shah</em> itself was a judicial review case concerning educational
                    grants to students “ordinarily resident” in the United Kingdom.
                    While these authorities did not concern applications for security for costs, I
                    concur with Lindsay J’s view in <em>In re Little Olympian
                        Each Ways Ltd</em> [1995] 1 WLR 560 (“<em>Little Olympian</em>”) at 566 that “so far as
                    concerns individuals the test applied in tax cases have without any awkwardness
                    or consciousness of injustice been adopted for other more general
                    purposes” and “one need not be especially shy in this area about
                    adopting the conclusion of tax cases to cases outside tax”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ordinarily resident in more than one jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In his written submissions for the purposes of
                    the 29 September 2010 hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Shannon Ong,
                    submitted (at para 16(ii)) that “[i]n fact a person can be
                    ordinarily resident in more than one place”, citing Kerr LJ’s
                    judgment in <em>Parkinson v Myer Wolff and Manley (a
                        firm)</em> (23 April 1985, Court of Appeal, unreported). However,
                    in his further arguments, Mr Ong contended that if a person is ordinarily
                    resident within jurisdiction, that same person cannot be ordinarily resident in
                    another jurisdiction. In support of that latter proposition, Mr Ong cited
                    the Singapore High Court decision in <em>Wishing Star Ltd v
                        Jurong Town Corp</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Wishing Star (HC)</em>”) where Choo Han Teck J
                    expressed the following view (at [3]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A branch is but a part of the company. When reference is made to the term
                        ‘ordinarily resident’, it applies to the company and not to its
                        branches. The question arises as to whether a company can be ordinarily
                        resident in a jurisdiction where its branches are located. <b><em>Generally speaking, it would do violence to the language to
                            hold that anyone, whether a corporate body or an individual person, may
                            be said to be ordinarily resident in more than one place at a time. A
                            person or a company may always set up more than one residence in as many
                            jurisdiction as they can afford – but a house is not a
                            home</em></b>. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Ong also invited me to find further authority for that
                    proposition in <em>Little Olympian</em> in
                    Lindsay J’s observations that (at 565–566):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The addition of the adverb ‘ordinarily’ does add something
                        of importance to the word ‘resident.’ It connotes a degree of
                        continuity being required, a reference to the way in which things are
                        usually or habitually ordered: see <em>Reg. v. Barnet London
                            Borough Council, Ex parte Nilish Shah</em> [1983]
                        2 A.C. 309, 341. <b><em>Whilst the added word might
                            not have a corresponding effect in the case of an individual</em></b>,
                        as I see it it is more difficult for a corporation to be ordinarily resident
                        in more than one place than it would be for it merely to be resident in more
                        than one place. <b><em>Moreover, the context of Ord. 23,
                            r. 1(1)(</em></b><b>a</b><b><em>) is, at lowest, consistent with the propositus having only
                            one ordinary residence. If that is not so one gets to the position,
                            surely uncontemplated, that whereas a man ordinarily resident here could
                            not have an order made against him by reason of his impecuniosity, if he
                            also were to be ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction then there
                            would be jurisdiction to make an order against him</em></b>. Both the
                        word "ordinarily" and the framework of Order 23 should incline me to a
                        meaning for ‘ordinarily resident’ in this case such that,
                            <em>other than in exceptional circumstances</em>, I
                        should be able to envisage only one such residence. [emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Despite Mr Ong’s strenuous
                    arguments to the contrary, to my mind, these judicial observations, so far as
                    they relate to an <em>individual</em> plaintiff, are
                        <em>obiter dicta</em>. Neither of these cases stands as
                    irref3utable authority for the proposition recommended by Mr Ong that no
                    individual plaintiff could be both ordinarily resident out of and within the
                    jurisdiction. As pointed out by counsel for the fifth and sixth defendants, Ms
                    Margaret Ling, the facts of both <em>Wishing Star (HC)</em>
                    and <em>Little Olympian</em> did not concern individual
                    plaintiffs, but plaintiff corporations. When the decision in <em>Wishing Star (HC)</em> refusing security for costs was upheld by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Jurong Town Corp v Wishing Star
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 427 (“<em>Wishing Star (CA)</em>”), the appellate court did not find it
                    at all necessary to deal with the issue of dual ordinary residences, accepting
                    instead as a fact that the plaintiff in that case, a company incorporated in
                    Hong Kong but with a registered office in Singapore, was ordinarily resident out
                    of jurisdiction. Indeed, the force of Choo J’s observations in
                        <em>Wishing Star (HC)</em> at [3] (quoted at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) is diminished somewhat by his views at
                    [4] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is, of course, possible that a company comprising of, say three
                        main shareholders and directors, may have three equally dominant centres of
                        management if each of the three operate in like-manner and extent in
                        different jurisdictions. <b><em>In such cases, the company may
                            be said to be ordinarily resident in each of the three jurisdictions for
                            the purposes of an application for security for costs</em></b>. ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While at first glance Lindsay J seemed to
                    have laid down the rule in <em>Little Olympian</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> <em>supra</em>) that under O 23 there can only be
                        <em>one</em> ordinary residence, I pause to observe
                    that the learned judge had not closed the door completely to the conceptual
                    possibility that an individual plaintiff can have more than just one ordinary
                    residence for the purposes of an order under O 23. First, in noting that
                    the addition of the adverb “ordinarily” adds something of
                    importance to the word “resident”, connoting a degree of
                    continuity and habit, Lindsay J opined in passing that “in the case
                    of an individual” the added adverb might <em>not</em> have the effect that it would be more difficult to be
                    ordinarily resident in more than one place, than to be merely resident in more
                    than one place. Second, the learned judge conceded that there could be
                    “exceptional circumstances” in which an individual plaintiff was
                    ordinarily resident in more than one jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In contrast, in a case involving an individual
                    plaintiff, <em>Leyvand v Barasch and others</em> (2000) The
                    Times 23 March (Transcript) (“<em>Leyvand</em>”), Lightman J held (at [5]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the Claimant is ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction
                        confers on the Court jurisdiction to order him to provide security.
                            <b><em>It is well established that a claimant may have two
                            ordinary residences, one within the jurisdiction and one outside. The
                            fact that a claimant who is ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction
                            is also ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction does not preclude
                            the Court from ordering security</em></b>. For Order 23 confers
                        jurisdiction to order security in the case of a claimant ‘ordinarily
                        resident out of the jurisdiction’ and not in the case of a claimant
                        ‘not ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction’. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Leyvand</em>, the claimant was an Israeli
                    national who had his principal home in Israel; Lightman J held that he was
                    ordinarily resident in Israel. The claimant in that case also had several real
                    property assets in England: a home, an investment property and leases of offices
                    he had used. While Lightman J held that the claimant had a substantial
                    connection with England (being “plainly resident” there), the
                    learned judge also held that it was unnecessary to decide whether he was
                        <em>also ordinarily resident</em> in England; if it
                    were necessary to do so, the learned judge would have held that the claimant was
                        <em>also</em> ordinarily resident in England (see
                        <em>Leyvand</em> at [8]). Overall, having regard to the
                    claimant’s long residence (“whether or not ordinary
                    residence”) and substantial assets in and his long connection with
                    England, Lightman J held (at [8]) that it would not be just to require him
                    to provide security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In an Australian case also dealing with an
                    individual plaintiff, <em>Logue v Hansen Technologies
                        Ltd</em> [2003] FCA 81 (“<em>Logue</em>”) at [24], Weinberg J accepted
                    Lightman J’s suggestion in <em>Leyvand</em> that
                    it may also be possible for a person to have two ordinary residences, one within
                    the jurisdiction and one outside; in such a case the court has power to order
                    security for costs. In <em>Logue</em>, ordering security
                    for costs against the plaintiff, Weinberg J held that on balance the
                    plaintiff had not formed a “settled purpose” to remain in
                    Australia and was thus not ordinarily resident in Australia: were it not for the
                    litigation in that case, the plaintiff would probably have gone to some other
                    place where the prospects of employment for someone with his background would be
                    significantly greater, even though he had ostensibly strong family connections
                    in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In another more recent Australian case,
                        <em>Corbett v Nguyen and others</em>
                    [2008] NSWSC 1265 (“<em>Corbett</em>”), White J expressed the view (at [11]) that
                    “[a] person may be resident and ordinarily resident in more than one
                    place at a time”, and there is jurisdiction to order security for costs
                    against a plaintiff who is ordinarily resident <em>in</em>
                    Australia even though such jurisdiction to do so is on the basis that the person
                    is <em>also</em> ordinarily resident <em>outside</em> Australia. While White J held (at [21]) that the
                    plaintiff in <em>Corbett</em> was held to be ordinarily
                    resident in Vietnam, he was equally of the opinion (at [22]) that it
                    “does not follow that the plaintiff has ceased to be resident, or
                    ordinarily resident, in New South Wales”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On balance, therefore, I am of the view that
                    the Court is <em>not</em> precluded from finding that, for
                    the purposes of ordering security for costs under O 23, an individual
                    plaintiff is ordinarily resident out of, as well as within, the jurisdiction.
                    Provided that the court finds that an individual plaintiff is ordinarily
                    resident out of the jurisdiction, it is seised of jurisdiction to exercise its
                    discretion to order security for costs against such a plaintiff, even though the
                    plaintiff may also be ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction. Such an
                    interpretation of O 23 would preserve the court’s discretion to order
                    security if it is just in all the circumstances to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Wishing Star
                        (CA</em> (<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> <em>supra</em>), the Court of Appeal preferred to reserve
                    to the courts a wide discretion, holding that (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that it is not an inflexible or rigid rule that a
                        plaintiff resident abroad should provide security for costs. The court has a
                            <b><em>complete discretion</em></b> in the matter: see
                            <em>Keary Developments Ltd v Tarmac Construction
                            Ltd</em> [1995] 3 All ER 534. It seems to us that under
                            r 1(1)(<em>a</em>), <em>once
                            the pre-condition, namely, being</em><b><em>‘ordinarily resident out of the
                            jurisdiction’, is satisfied, the court will consider all the
                            circumstances to determine whether it is just that security should be
                            ordered</em></b>. There is no presumption in favour of, or against, a
                        grant. <b><em>The ultimate decision is in the discretion of the
                            court, after balancing the competing factors</em></b>. No objective
                        criteria can ever be laid down as to the weight any particular factor should
                        be accorded. It would depend on the fact situation. Where the court is of
                        the view that the circumstances are evenly balanced it would ordinarily be
                        just to order security against a foreign plaintiff. [emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the present facts, the objective evidence
                    indicates that the plaintiffs are ordinarily resident in Indonesia as they
                    appear to have adopted Indonesia voluntarily as a place of residence with a
                    substantial degree of settled purpose, <em>ie</em>, for
                    residential and business purposes. First, they own immovable property in
                    Indonesia, consistently providing their Indonesian addresses in various
                    documents pertaining to the Suit, including (a) the Deed of Incorporation of PT
                    Deefu dated 12 December 2000, and (b) the 1st S&amp;PA and the supplemental
                    agreements thereto, dated between 2004 and 2006. The first plaintiff averred in
                    an affidavit dated 28 April 2010 (at para 8) that the first defendant
                    had procured the insertion of his Indonesian address in these documents and
                    Mr Ong submitted that the first plaintiff could not read those documents as
                    the latter is not well versed in English. Despite his averments to the contrary,
                    I had doubts that as an experienced businessman he would have failed to at least
                    have the documents explained to him, or that he would have failed to recognise
                    that his Indonesian address was used on those documents. In any event, these
                    explanations could not account for the use of his Indonesian address in other
                    documents. For instance, both the first and third plaintiffs provided their
                    Indonesian addresses when they registered themselves as directors of Venus
                    International Productions Pte Ltd (“Venus Productions”), a company
                    incorporated in Singapore. It bears noting that under sub-ss 173(2) and (6) of
                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies
                    Act”), a person is required to provide his “usual residential
                    address” when he is registered as a director of a company. Moreover, in
                    the writ of summons in Suit No 348 of 2008 against Antig (“the Antig
                    Suit”) (filed on 20 May 2008), and affidavits filed in relation
                    thereto in July and August 2008, the plaintiffs also used their Indonesian
                    addresses. These addresses are registered against their Indonesian
                    identification documents. The first plaintiff also stated (in an affidavit dated
                    19 August 2010 at para 11) that he had provided an Indonesian address in
                    the aforementioned documents as a “means of identification and for
                    contact purposes”. If he did not hold himself out as being ordinarily
                    resident in Indonesia, there would scarcely have been any need to provide an
                    Indonesian address for “contact purposes” in these relatively
                    recent documents, particularly in the light of his averments in the same
                    affidavit that he can be found at a Singapore address, <em>viz</em>, 19 Cairnhill Circle, #17-05 The Light Cairnhill
                    (“The Light”) (at para 7), and that he had set up a home in
                    Singapore since 1995 (at para 6(i)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Second, it is common ground that the first
                    plaintiff has various businesses in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Third, by way of contrast, it is undisputed
                    that none of the plaintiffs owns real property in Singapore, whereas the first
                    plaintiff’s wife and one of his daughters own a property at 8 Cairnhill
                    Circle, #06-12 Cairnhill Crest, in Singapore (see first plaintiff’s
                    affidavit dated 28 April 2010 at para 7(v)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Therefore, in my view, the pre-condition for
                    the exercise of my discretion to order security for costs against the plaintiffs
                    under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) has been
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, it does not follow that the first
                    plaintiff could not also be found to be ordinarily resident in Singapore. While
                    it was not strictly necessary for me to make any finding on whether the first
                    plaintiff is also ordinarily resident in Singapore, having applied my mind to
                    the objective evidence raised by Mr Ong as to the first plaintiff’s
                    substantial connections to Singapore, I came to the conclusion that he is also
                    ordinarily resident in Singapore. First, it is clear that he has strong family
                    ties here. His wife and three of his children are Singapore Permanent Residents,
                    while one of his children is a Singapore citizen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Second, I also accepted the first
                    plaintiff’s evidence that he has spent a considerable amount of time here
                    in Singapore since 2007. In 2007 and 2008, he was in Singapore for a total of at
                    least 250 days and 133 days respectively. On 29 July 2008, he obtained an
                    employment pass from the Ministry of Manpower and was granted a multiple-journey
                    visa. As such, it is not apparent from his passport how many days he was in
                    Singapore from that time, although he stated (at para 6(iii) of his
                    19 August 2010 affidavit) that he was in Singapore for at least more than
                    half a year in each of the years 2008 and 2009. When he is in Singapore, he
                    lives with his family at their rented premises at The Light (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). This should be contrasted with the
                    facts in <em>Logue</em> (<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> <em>supra</em>); the fact that while in Australia the
                    applicant lived with his mother and step-father rather than with his partner
                    (from whom he was estranged) and children diminished the weight normally
                    accorded to the fact that he has a partner and children in Australia (see
                        <em>Logue</em> at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Third, he has business interests here in
                    Singapore, being the director and/or shareholder of two companies incorporated
                    here, namely, Venus Productions (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                    above) and Master Lube Singapore Pte Ltd (“Master
                Lube”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rationale for ordering security for costs against foreign-resident
                plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Ong further submitted in further
                    arguments that even if a plaintiff can be held to be ordinarily resident both
                    within and out of jurisdiction for the purposes of an order for security for
                    costs against him, the rationale behind ordering such security indicates that in
                    such a case no order for security should be made. He pointed to
                    Quain J’s dicta in <em>Raeburn v Andrews</em>
                    (1874) LR 9 QB 118 (“<em>Raeburn v</em>
                    Andrews”) at 121 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason that a plaintiff resident abroad was compelled to give security
                        for costs was because he was not in reach of our law to have process served
                        on him, in the event of the defendant obtaining a judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, I note that immediately after stating that reason,
                    Quain J held (at 121) that “[t]hat reason having now <em>ceased</em>, the old rule is abolished”. Both
                    Blackburn and Archibald JJ (at 120 and 121 respectively) agreed that that
                    reason for ordering security for costs against a plaintiff resident abroad (in
                    so far as Scotland was concerned) had ceased as a result of the enactment of the
                    Judgments Extension Act 1868 which made judgments of the superior courts of
                    England, Scotland and Ireland mutually registrable and enforceable on the
                    production of a certificate of the court where the judgment was obtained. In
                        <em>Wilson Vehicle Distributions Ltd v The Colt Car Co
                        Ltd</em> [1984] BCLC 93, Bingham J observed (at 94)
                    that prior to that enactment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Security was ordered because of the <b><em>difficulty and
                            delay of enforcing orders for costs in foreign jurisdictions</em></b>
                        and for this purpose England, Ireland and Scotland were independent
                        jurisdictions and accordingly foreign to each other. [emphasis
                        added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Ong also referred me to
                    Millett J’s observations in <em>DSQ Property Co Ltd v
                        Lotus Cars Ltd</em> [1987] 1 WLR 127 (“<em>DSQ Property</em>”) at 131:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view the true ratio of <em>Raeburn v.
                            Andrews</em> proceeds upon the straightforward principle that
                        irrelevant circumstances should be ignored, and that plaintiffs in similar
                        circumstances should be similarly treated. Where the plaintiff is an
                        individual, with or without means, his residence in Scotland or Northern
                        Ireland is irrelevant. <b><em>He is resident within the reach
                            of our process, and security should not be ordered against him any more
                            than it would be ordered against an individual plaintiff resident in
                            England. In my view that is still the law</em></b>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is important to set Millett J’s
                    words in context. The learned judge was dealing with an application for security
                    for costs against an insolvent plaintiff company incorporated in Northern
                    Ireland. As the relevant companies legislation (<em>in pari
                        materia</em> with s 388(1) of our Companies Act permitting
                    applications for security for costs against plaintiff companies) applied only
                    within Great Britain (thus excluding Northern Ireland from its reach), the
                    defendants there had to apply for security for costs under the Rules of the
                    Supreme Court (“RSC”) Ord 23 r 1(1) (identical to our
                    O 23 r 1(1)). There was no doubt in <em>DSQ
                        Property</em> that the plaintiff company was incorporated in Northern
                    Ireland, <em>ie</em>, outside England and Wales, outside
                    the jurisdiction for the purposes of an RSC Ord 23 application. The
                    question was whether the holding in <em>Raeburn v
                        Andrews</em> (<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> <em>supra</em>) that as a result of the Judgments Extension
                    Act 1868 an individual plaintiff resident in Scotland was not required to
                    provide security for costs applied to the facts in <em>DSQ
                        Property</em> to preclude an order for security for costs against the
                    plaintiff there. In Millett J’s judgment <em>Raeburn v
                        Andrews</em> had no such effect; it had no application to a plaintiff
                    which was an insolvent company with limited liability (see <em>DSQ Property</em> at 131).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     To my mind, Millett J’s
                    observations (quoted in <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) do not
                    apply to the present facts. First, <em>DSQ Property</em> in
                    fact concerned an insolvent company incorporated in Northern Ireland, not an
                    individual plaintiff. Thus, the learned judge’s comments with regard to an
                    individual plaintiff are strictly <em>obiter</em>. Whatever
                    his views were as regards the “true ratio” of <em>Raeburn v Andrews</em>, he was equally of the view that that case did
                    not apply to the facts before him. Second, it is also clear that his comments
                    did not pertain to the factual scenario of an individual plaintiff being
                    ordinarily resident in more than one jurisdiction. In that passage quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, Millett J was comparing
                    one plaintiff resident in Scotland or Northern Ireland with another plaintiff
                    resident in England; both were resident within the jurisdiction and equally
                    within the reach of the English courts. He had clearly not applied his mind to
                    the possibility of an individual plaintiff being ordinarily resident both within
                    and out of the jurisdiction; and he would have had little reason to so apply his
                    mind since there was no dispute that the plaintiff he was concerned with in that
                    case was obviously only resident in one jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Furthermore, Millett J was not prepared
                    to hold that the rule laid down in <em>Raeburn v
                        Andrews</em> has “survived as an inflexible rule of practice
                    after the introduction of the present Rules of the Supreme Court in
                    1964”; rather, he was of the view that in fact, RSC Ord 23 which was
                    introduced under statutory authority had “<em>significantly changed</em> the previous practice”, conferring
                    on the Court a “<em>general discretion</em> to order
                    security in the prescribed cases ‘if, having regard to all the
                    circumstances of the case, the court thinks it just to do so’”
                    [emphasis added] (see <em>DSQ Property</em> at
                    132–133). Therefore, security is no longer ordered against a foreign
                    resident as a matter of course. This proposition was declared to be
                    “settled law” by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wishing
                        Star (CA)</em> at [14] (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     If the court has <em>no</em> discretion to order security against a plaintiff resident
                    within the jurisdiction on the basis that he was amenable to the process of the
                    court, then surely on that reasoning <em>every</em>
                    plaintiff who is resident <em>out of</em> the jurisdiction
                    should be made to provide security since such a plaintiff would <em>not</em> be amenable to the process of the court. Yet, it is
                    settled law that no such inflexible rule is applied rigidly to every plaintiff
                    ordinarily resident abroad. In my view, amenability to the process of the court
                    in Singapore should not be the “be all and end all” of the
                    decision whether or not to order security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Ooi Ching Ling Shirley v
                        Just Gems Inc</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 738, the Court of Appeal
                    stated the rationale for ordering security for costs against a plaintiff
                    ordinarily resident abroad in the following terms (at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The whole point of ordering a foreign plaintiff or appellant to
                        furnish security is to ensure that a fund would be available within the
                        jurisdiction of this court against which the successful defendant or
                        respondent could enforce the judgment for costs: see <em>Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd</em> [1987] 1 WLR 420
                        at 422. Without such further security there is a real risk that JGI
                            [<em>ie</em>, the respondent] could be left with a
                        costs order which would be unenforceable or only enforceable with great
                        difficulty and expense, plus delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The rationale stated in this manner does not, in my view, preclude a
                    plaintiff who has been found to be ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction
                    from being ordered to furnish security, simply because he has also been found to
                    be ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction. The fact of his ordinary
                    residence within the jurisdiction does not say anything about the ease of
                    enforcement of a costs order against him, particularly where he has also been
                    found to be ordinarily resident abroad. In the case of an individual plaintiff
                    ordinarily resident <em>only</em> within the jurisdiction,
                    I agree that the court would have no jurisdiction under O 23 to order
                    security for costs against him; the defendant would have to take him as he is.
                    Additionally, where the plaintiff is a natural person, public policy leans much
                    more towards encouraging access to the courts (see <em>Ong Jane
                        Rebecca v Pricewaterhousecoopers</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 796
                        (“<em>Ong Jane Rebecca</em>”) at [30]).
                    However, even if the plaintiff is ordinarily resident within the jurisdiction,
                    where he is also ordinarily resident <em>out of</em> the
                    jurisdiction, there is still the attendant risk that the defendant may be left
                    with a costs order which would be “unenforceable or only enforceable with
                    great difficulty and expense, plus delay”, for example, if he has no
                    substantial assets in Singapore and retreats to the other ordinary residence
                    outside the jurisdiction. Therefore, in a case where a plaintiff has dual
                    ordinary residences, the court should retain its unfettered discretion to
                    consider whether, in <em>all</em> the circumstances of the
                    case including of course the fact that the plaintiff is also ordinarily resident
                    within the jurisdiction, it is <em>just</em> to order
                    security for costs against the plaintiff. In this regard, I echo
                    Lightman J’s words in <em>Leyvand</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) (at [6]): “the simple and single
                    criterion for ordering security is what is just in the circumstances of the
                    particular case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Having found that the plaintiffs are
                    ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction and dealt with the purported
                    impediments to the exercise of my discretion under O 23 r 1(1), I turn
                    now to considering whether it is just in all the circumstances of the case to
                    order security for costs against the plaintiffs. At this juncture I note that
                    there is no need for me to make any finding under O 23
                        r 1(1)(<em>b</em>) on whether the second and third
                    plaintiffs are nominal plaintiffs who will be unable to pay the costs of the
                    defendants if ordered to do so as I may exercise my discretion under
                        r 1(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Just in all the circumstances to order security for costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Wishing Star
                        (CA)</em> (<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> <em>supra</em>), the Court of Appeal held (at [14]) that
                    where the circumstances are “evenly balanced” it would
                    “ordinarily be just” to order security against a foreign
                    plaintiff, citing with approval the following comments by Browne-Wilkinson VC in
                        <em>Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd</em> [1987]
                    1 WLR 420 (“<em>Porzelack</em>”) at
                    423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under R.S.C., Ord 23, r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) it
                        seems to be that I have an entirely general discretion either to award or
                        refuse security, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
                        However, it is clear on the authorities that, if other matters are equal, it
                        is normally just to exercise that discretion by ordering security against a
                        non-resident plaintiff. The question is what, in all the circumstances of
                        the case, is the just answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assets in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This general position should be balanced
                    against Lightman J’s perspicacious observations in <em>Leyvand</em> that (at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the connection of the claimant with this country is of course relevant
                        to the exercise of discretion, and <b><em>the closer the
                            connection, the greater the relevance</em></b>. If the claimant has an
                        established home and is resident here, security may <b><em>rarely</em></b><b>be required;</b><b><em>if the claimant has an established home and is
                            ordinarily resident here an order for security may even more rarely be
                            ordered</em></b>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As I have noted at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above, the first plaintiff has
                    close connections with Singapore. He has an established home here at The Light
                    where he lives with his family whenever he is here. He also owns shares in two
                    companies incorporated in Singapore, <em>viz</em>, Venus
                    Productions and Master Lube, and is also a director of Venus
                Productions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, he does not own any substantial
                    property of a fixed and permanent nature. Security will not usually be required
                    from a person permanently residing out of the jurisdiction if he has substantial
                    property, whether real or personal, within it, but the property should be of a
                    fixed and permanent nature, which can certainly be available for costs (see
                        <em>White Book</em> at para 23/3/11). It is beyond
                    dispute that the first plaintiff does not own any fixed property in Singapore.
                    While his wife and daughter own property here, they are not parties to this
                    action and it is not their assets against which the defendants are able to
                    enforce any costs order in their favour. Moreover, doubts have been raised as to
                    the value of the shares that the first plaintiff owns in Venus Productions and
                    Master Lube.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I note also that the second and third
                    plaintiffs have not provided a shred of evidence as to their assets in
                    Singapore. Therefore, it does not appear that the plaintiffs own any assets of
                    substance in Singapore against which costs orders in the defendants’
                    favour can be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relative strengths of parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Apart from the existence of fixed and
                    permanent assets within the jurisdiction, other pertinent factors to consider
                    include whether the plaintiff’s claim is <em>bona
                        fide</em>, has a reasonably good prospect of success, and whether the
                    application for security was being used oppressively with a view to stifling a
                    genuine claim (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The assessment of the plaintiff’s
                    likelihood of success should not entail a detailed examination of the merits of
                    the plaintiff’s case. In <em>Porzelack</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> <em>supra</em>), in response to parties’ seeking to investigate in
                    considerable detail the likelihood or otherwise of success in the action,
                    Browne-Wilkinson VC expressed the view (at 423) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think that is a right course to adopt on an application for
                        security for costs. The decision is necessarily made at an interlocutory
                        stage on inadequate material and without any hearing of the evidence. A
                        detailed examination of the possibilities of success or failure merely blows
                        the case up into a large interlocutory hearing involving great expenditure
                        of both money and time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At first blush that one principal ground of
                    the plaintiffs’ claim is <em>non est factum</em> does
                    not inspire confidence that the first plaintiff will succeed. It would be
                    reasonable for one to entertain doubts as to a seasoned businessman’s
                    claim that he had signed several sale and purchase agreements for shares without
                    ascertaining the true consequences and effect of those agreements. The
                    plaintiffs had commenced the Antig Suit (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above) in May 2008 against Antig to restrain Antig from
                    effecting payment of US$3.7m (which, under the 1st S&amp;PA was due for payment
                    in June 2008) to any party other than the plaintiffs. I note that even though
                    the court proceedings in the Antig Suit were ultimately stayed in favour of
                    arbitration by the Court of Appeal on 2 February 2009, the plaintiffs did
                    not commence any arbitration proceedings against Antig. If the plaintiffs had a
                    strong case against Antig, I would have expected them to proceed to
                    arbitration post haste. Instead, the plaintiffs filed the present Suit on
                    8 February 2010, slightly more than a year after the Court of Appeal had
                    stayed the Antig Suit in favour of arbitration, claiming that, <em>inter alia</em>, that sum of US$3.7m – part of the
                    US$12m that had been wrongfully paid out to the second and fourth defendants
                    – had been received by the second defendant in November
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the defence that the plaintiffs owed
                    the second and fourth defendants money for which reason part of the sale
                    proceeds of the 1st S&amp;PA were directed to be paid to them is equally
                    implausible. To date, the defendants have not produced credible documentary
                    evidence supporting their claims of such debts owed to them by the
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the same day that the plaintiffs filed the
                    present Suit, they obtained an <em>ex parte Mareva</em>
                    injunction against the first to ninth defendants. On 17 March 2010, Steven
                    Chong JC set aside the <em>Mareva</em> injunction
                    primarily on the basis of the delay on the plaintiffs’ part in applying
                    for the injunction: see Chong JC’s oral judgment in Suit No 89 of
                    2010 (Summonses Nos 852, 869, 888 and 923 of 2010) dated 17 March 2010. He
                    was also of the view that the shareholders’ circular adduced by the second
                    and fourth defendants to explain the payment of part of the purchase price to
                    them was (at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... intended to create at least a misleading if not a false impression
                        that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>
                        Defendants were entitled to receive part of the purchase price under the
                            [1<sup>st</sup> S&amp;PA] because the Plaintiffs were
                        indebted to them. This is one of the troubling features in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Before Chong JC, counsel for the first defendant accepted that
                    the statement in the shareholders’ circular was incorrect.
                    Chong JC’s concerns as to the merits of the defendants’ case
                    were reinforced by the fact that the fifth defendant had produced a Credit
                    Agreement ostensibly to support the existence of the debt owed by the
                    plaintiffs, which agreement in his opinion raised more doubts about the
                    purported debt than supported it. Thus, even though Chong JC was satisfied
                    that the plaintiffs had a good arguable case when he granted the <em>Mareva</em> injunction, he noted in his 17 March 2010
                    oral judgment (at [17]) that there were “troubling features on both sides
                    of the dispute” and numerous issues in both the plaintiffs’ claim
                    and the defence in the Suit that remained unresolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I agree with Chong JC’s view that
                    there were doubts as to both the plaintiffs’ claim and the defence. In
                    such a situation where the circumstances are so evenly balanced, the
                    plaintiffs’ lack of substantial assets in Singapore would ordinarily make
                    it just to order security for costs against them, provided that such an order
                    would not oppressively stifle their claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Oppressiveness of application for security for costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Before the court refuses to order security on
                    the ground that it would unfairly stifle any claim, it has to be satisfied that
                    the plaintiff concerned does not have the ability to provide the security (see
                        <em>Ong Jane Rebecca</em> (<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [33]). The onus is on the plaintiff to
                    show that he does not have the ability to provide security, and that this
                    inability would unfairly stifle his claim. While it was submitted on the
                    plaintiffs’ behalf that asking for security for costs was just an attempt
                    to stifle their claim, they have not given any credible evidence to back that
                    bare assertion. Indeed, at the hearing of further arguments, Mr Ong
                    conceded that while his clients had the ability to provide the security ordered
                    here in favour of the first, fifth and sixth defendants, his concern was that if
                    all the other defendants applied similarly for security for costs, the total
                    amount of security to be provided in such event would result in their claim
                    being stifled. I take on board that likelihood. Should it transpire that the
                    other defendants similarly apply for security for costs against the plaintiffs,
                    I direct that their applications be fixed before me. Each application should be
                    considered separately, and the likelihood of stifling of the plaintiffs’
                    claims should be assessed separately in each application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Overall, I find that it is just in all the
                    circumstances of the case that the plaintiffs should provide some security.
                    Moreover, I note that the amount of security awarded is in the complete
                    discretion of the court, which will fix such sum as it thinks just, having
                    regard to all the circumstances of the case (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Sumio Sakata v Fuminori Paul
                        Naruse</em> [2004] SGHC 102 at [7]). While counsel for the
                    fifth and sixth defendants have given indications of the amount of work that has
                    been done to date in respect of the Suit, they have not provided indications of
                    the costs incurred by their clients for the work done thus far.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Therefore, I order as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     In relation to Sum 2961/2010,
                        the application is allowed. The plaintiffs’ claims against the fifth
                        and sixth defendants in the Suit are stayed without further order until the
                        plaintiffs provide security for the costs of the fifth and sixth defendants
                        in the Suit, for up to and including the date ordered by the Court for the
                        plaintiffs and defendants to file their Lists of Documents in this Suit, by
                        paying into court, or providing a banker’s guarantee in favour of the
                        fifth and sixth defendants (to the reasonable satisfaction of the fifth and
                        sixth defendants) in the amount of $40,000, such security to be provided
                        within seven days from the date of this judgment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     In relation to RA 234/2010, the
                        appeal is allowed. The plaintiffs’ claims against the first defendant
                        are stayed until the plaintiffs provide security for the costs of the first
                        defendant in the Suit, for up to and including the date ordered by the court
                        for the plaintiffs and defendants to file their Lists of Documents in this
                        Suit, by paying into court, or providing a banker’s guarantee in
                        favour of the first defendant (to the reasonable satisfaction of the first
                        defendant) in the amount of $35,000, such security to be provided within
                        seven days from the date of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At the hearing on 12 October 2010, costs
                    were fixed at $3,750 in favour of the fifth and sixth defendants, and at $1,800
                    in favour of the first defendant. The costs orders shall remain
                    unchanged.</p>
