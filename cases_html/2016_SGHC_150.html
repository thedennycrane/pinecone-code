In the morning of 31 December 2014, the accused entered Singapore from Malaysia in a car, together with his wife and two of his brothers-in-law.

He stated that he was able to earn about S$3,000 per month from the bird trading business and S$2,000 to S$4,000 per month from his travel business. During the school holiday season, he could easily earn S$4,000 a month as there was a higher demand for travel.

He collected the diamorphine under suspicious circumstances with full knowledge that they were illegal items, and yet chose to wilfully turn a blind eye towards the contents of the items received. His wilful refusal or failure to check the contents is indicative of his actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs and he fails to rebut the s 18(2) presumption on a balance of probabilities.

</div> It suffices for me to set out the most pertinent examples of such conduct: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Accused did not take great pains to conceal A1 and A2. He simply inserted them under the car seats. CPL Fairuz was able to detect A1 and A2 without much difficulty. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Accused entered Singapore together with his wife and brothers-in-law. If he had known that he was carrying drugs, he would not have placed them at risk of arrest. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Accused had no reason to suspect that A1 and A2 contained drugs, given that he had carried out two previous deliveries for Ali without incident. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Accused brought 200 live birds with him. If he had known that he was importing such quantities of drugs into Singapore, he would not have risked arousing the suspicion of ICA officers by bringing in such a large number of birds. If the ICA officers checked Yusmazina’s car, they would invariably have found the birds and thereafter subjected Yusmazina’s car to a full inspection. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Accused and his family were financially stable with no financial problems. The Accused and Yusmazina collectively earned a not insubstantial income and could bring the family for several holidays in 2014 (see [10] and [11] above). There was therefore no reason for him to resort to drug importation to earn additional money.

In this statement, the Accused’s response to CPL Shalihan’s query about the contents of A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A was, quite simply, “Drugs.” I have set out the entirety of the statement at [25] above.

</div> The Accused’s answer that they were “Drugs” extended not only to the two packets of brownish granular substance contained in transparent packaging (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>A1A1 and A1B1) but also to the <span class="font-italic">unopened</span> bundle.

I emphasise that A2A1A1A therefore could not have been visible when the overall bundle remained unopened. This is very important from the point of view of establishing whether or not the Accused had prior intimate knowledge of the nature of the items contained in the plastic bag that he was bringing into Singapore.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Accused submits that prior to the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement, ICA officers had already informed the Accused that the packets contained “heroin”. He suggests that CPL Fairuz showed the two packets of brown granular substance to him and told him that the packets contained “heroin”.

</div> He explains that “there was some contact and conversation between the Accused and [CPL Fairuz]”, and that SGT Dzulkhairi gave evidence that “he could not remember” whether there was such a conversation between the Accused and CPL Fairuz. He proceeds to argue that “[h]ence, even before the record of the contemporaneous statement, it is submitted that the Accused had come to know from the ICA officers that the plastic bag contained drugs”.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I reject this submission. I find that the responses provided by SGT Dzulkhairi during cross-examination do not indicate that CPL Fairuz spoke to the Accused, much less that he actually told the Accused that the packets contained “heroin”. SGT Dzulkhairi’s evidence is that when CPL Fairuz showed the Accused the plastic bag, the Accused simply “looked down”. I believe SGT Dzulkhairi’s evidence on this point. It is pertinent to highlight that this spontaneous behaviour of the Accused in looking down immediately upon being shown the plastic bag in itself suggests to me that the Accused was involuntarily exhibiting some guilty feelings, even <span class="font-italic">before</span> the items within the bag (which could not be seen at this stage) were taken out and shown to the Accused. SGT Dzulkhairi was unable to recall whether CPL Fairuz said anything to the Accused, or if the Accused said anything upon seeing the plastic bag. There is nothing in this series of questions and answers that demonstrates that the Accused was informed by ICA officers, prior to the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement, that A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A contained “heroin”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I will make two further observations on this submission. First, the Accused did not state in any of his nine recorded statements that any ICA officer told him that the packets contained “heroin”. He had the full opportunity to give a detailed and complete account of the events that occurred on 31 December 2014, yet failed to mention a conversation as crucial to his case as this. This omission casts serious doubt on the Accused’s submission. Second, counsel for the Accused never once asked or put to CPL Fairuz during his cross-examination that CPL Fairuz spoke to the Accused, and told the Accused that the packets contained “heroin” or drugs. I am led ineluctably to the conclusion that the Accused’s defence in this regard is nothing but an afterthought.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I now turn to the Accused’s allegations regarding CPL Shalihan’s recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement. At trial, the Accused claimed that he did not say, in response to CPL Shalihan’s question about what A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A were, that they were “Drugs” (or “<span class="font-italic">dadah</span>” in Malay). According to the Accused, his response was “‘Cas Cas’ bird food”. He also asserted that he told CPL Shalihan that ICA officers had told him that the packets were actually drugs.

For instance, in response to CPL Shalihan’s subsequent query “What are you going to do with these drugs?”, one would have expected the Accused to (i) deny that the packets contained drugs; (ii) reiterate that he was under the impression that the packets contained “Cas Cas” bird food and (iii) explain that, on that premise, he was to deliver the packets to one of Ali’s friends in Singapore. Instead, the Accused simply replied, “Someone will call me and I will hand over it to him.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The fact remains that in his responses to questions Q2 to Q5, the Accused never once contended that the packets did not contain drugs or that he did not know they contained drugs as opposed to bird food. This was despite the repeated references to drugs in CPL Shalihan’s questions. The Accused admitted that he was at all times aware that drug importation was a serious criminal offence in Singapore which potentially carried the death penalty.

</div> In my judgment, given the Accused’s knowledge of the gravity of the situation, had he truly no knowledge that the packets contained drugs as opposed to bird food, he would have assertively and categorically denied that the packets contained drugs or that he had any such knowledge when answering CPL Shalihan’s questions. I also find that the equivocal and oblique manner in which he responded to questions during cross-examination in the extract at [55] above marred his credit in the eyes of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I also reject the Accused’s claim that CPL Shalihan deliberately misread the Accused’s answer when reading the First Contemporaneous Statement back to the Accused.

</div> In any case, I do not think that the Accused, a literate and intelligent man capable of running several businesses and who was fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, would have signed the First Contemporaneous Statement without having read it and assured himself that it accurately reflected his answers. It is a very brief statement containing short questions that were to the point and brief answers from the Accused that answered the questions directly. I do not think that the Accused would have any difficulty reading the First Contemporaneous Statement for himself and ensuring that it was accurate before he signed it. I observe also that SI Raziff gave evidence that he clearly remembered CPL Shalihan reading the statement back to the Accused, and that the answer to the first question read by CPL Shalihan was “<span class="font-italic">dadah</span>”.

The Accused said that he did not know. SSGT Syahrul then asked him if he wished to cooperate with the CNB, to which the Accused replied, “I really don’t know”.

They detract substantially from his credibility. I note also that Yusmazina, the Accused’s wife, gave evidence that she saw B1 with the biscuit box and two drink packets in the car boot in the morning of 31 December 2014, before they left for Singapore. She asked the Accused if those items were intended for the children, and if so, why he did not simply leave those items at home. The Accused replied that it was okay and that they should just leave the items there as Yusmazina was already late for work.

When SSGT Syahrul asked the Accused subsequently what the plastic bag contained, the Accused replied that he had been told that the items were meant for his children (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> the Accused’s children).

When asked what B1A2 was, the Accused responded “This is also a prohibited items”. The Accused then answered “I do not know” to the subsequent questions “What is this prohibited items?” and “Who does it belong to?” In response to the question where the Accused got the items from, he answered, “I got it from a male Indian and a Chinese Malaysian at [the writing “Bu” is cancelled] Jusco Bukit Indah yesterday.” And when asked what he was going to do with them, he responded, “I was told by my friend Ali to wait for a call for further instruction after entering Singapor[e].” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The Accused’s explanation in respect of the Second Contemporaneous Statement is that, when responding to the question about the contents of B1A1A, B1B1A and B1C1A, he never said “This is a prohibited items”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Prosecution observes that given the circumstances, the Accused had every reason to make enquiries, or at the very minimum, take a look at the items collected. I agree with this submission. The circumstances in which the Accused collected A1 and A2, which contained diamorphine, were highly suspicious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, the Accused was acquainted with neither the male Chinese nor the male Indian. He had no basis for assuming that the items collected from them were indeed from Ali. The Accused was given no further details by Ali about the persons he was to meet other than that they consisted of one male Chinese and one male Indian. The Accused did not have their names, telephone numbers or any other contact details. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, further increasing the intrigue of the situation, the two persons whom he met asked him if he was a friend of “Botak”. Up to this point, the Accused had never encountered a reference to Ali as “Botak”. Yet it appears that the Accused never asked the two men if they were really referring to Ali, or made further inquiries of them to ascertain if “Botak” and “Ali” was one and the same person. In my view, this would have been the immediate instinct of the Accused. Nor did he call Ali to confirm that these two men, who knew only “Botak”, were indeed the two men he was supposed to meet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Third, the Accused had never collected items from Ali in this manner before. On the first occasion in November 2014, Ali personally delivered the items to him, arriving at the Accused’s house in a taxi. On the second occasion, the items were passed to him also at his house, by the taxi driver who had ferried Ali to the Accused’s house on the previous occasion. The collection of items from two unknown men at “JUSCO Bukit Indah” was therefore an entirely different practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 When asked during cross-examination why he did not open the plastic bags there and then to verify if they contained “Cas Cas”, the Accused’s response was, “Firstly, I wanted to go home quickly. And secondly, I was tired. And thirdly, I believed that the s---these guys whom I met were Ali’s friends.”

</div> I find the Accused’s explanation unconvincing. It would have been the easiest and quickest of tasks for the Accused simply to have removed the few items from the plastic bags and taken a quick look at them, even if the Accused was in a hurry to go home. This brief and elementary visual examination would immediately have revealed that the plastic bags contained a clearly suspicious brown granular substance which did not bear even a remote resemblance to “Cas Cas” bird food. The brown granular substance would have been clearly visible through the transparent packaging of A1A1 and A1B1, even if one were to disregard the package A2A1A1A, the contents of which were concealed under wrapping paper. The Accused would immediately have observed that the brown granular substances were simply too coarse to be bird food, at least for small birds. I note that the bird food and “Cas Cas” obtained by the Prosecution (see [92] – [95]) below) from “Kip Mart Tampoi” based on the directions of the Accused are not even remotely as coarse as the substance that could be seen in A1A1 and A1B1. They are so different both in their colour and overall texture that I do not think the Accused would have failed to realise that A1A1 and A1B1 could not be bird food, or “Cas Cas”, or bird food mixed with “Cas Cas”. He would then have been prompted to remove A2A1A1A from its wrapping paper, and would plainly have observed that A2A1A1A contained the same suspicious substance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Accused was told that the items he would be bringing into Singapore were illegal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Based on the Accused’s own account, Ali expressly informed the Accused that the “Cas Cas” bird food he would be bringing into Singapore was illegal.

</div> Ali further stated that the “Cas Cas” had to be hidden and should not be checked by ICA officers in Singapore. If ICA officers discovered the “Cas Cas”, they would question him on the origins of the “Cas Cas”. Even taken alone, Ali’s warning that the items handed to him were illegal would surely have been grave cause for suspicion. Ali, who was more of a customer than a very close friend of the Accused, was asking the Accused to run the risk of getting caught for bringing prohibited items into Singapore. In fact, the Accused testified that prior to Ali’s warning, the Accused already knew that “Cas Cas” was illegal in Singapore, having been so informed by “[m]any people – [his] uncle, [and his] bird enthusiast friends”.

The requested delivery of the illegal “Cas Cas” bird food was itself a massive escalation from the delivery of chocolates and packet drinks on the previous two occasions. The Accused’s response to this objection was that despite the illegality of “Cas Cas” bird food, “it may not be so bad that it may, at the most, I might be summoned or fined”.

Equally questionable is the fact that the Accused never ascertained the size of the fine that he would likely have to pay if caught with the “Cas Cas” (given that he was amenable to taking such a risk only if the fine did not exceed S$500), nor did he seek confirmation from Ali that Ali would “reimburse” the Accused for any fine paid.

I emphasise also that such evidence consists entirely of the Accused’s description of Ali in his statements and at trial. There are no documentary records indicating the existence of such a person or evidencing his relationship with the Accused. The Prosecution has offered no evidence of Ali, nor would it need to do so in order to establish its case.

</div> the Accused has produced no business records evidencing any commercial transactions between Ali and the Accused. On the Accused’s account, he has transacted with Ali numerous times over 2013 and 2014, with Ali making substantial payments to the Accused (see [36] to [38] above). The Accused purchased birds and bird cages from Singapore and delivered or resold them to Ali in Malaysia. He also arranged overseas trips for Ali as part of the Accused’s travel business. One would have expected the Accused to have produced any number of receipts, invoices, tickets, records or like documentary evidence to prove such transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 When questioned on the absence of such evidence, the Accused conveniently claimed that they could no longer be found:

I refer to the Accused’s description of his relationship with Ali (at [36] to [40] above): The Accused met Ali only five times in 2013. Each of these meetings was for the purpose of the sale and purchase of birds or bird cages. The Accused agreed that on all the occasions when he met Ali in 2013, the Accused would simply deliver the birds to Ali and Ali would hand over the necessary cash payment and “that was it”.

</div> Moreover, the Accused contacted Ali only through an intermediary, never personally. There was then a substantial period of at least nine months when the Accused did not have any contact with Ali at all. When they resumed contact, their interactions were only in relation to the marketing of birds to Ali as part of the Accused’s standard business practice.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Accused claims that Ali invited him and his family to Desaru, where they had a night barbeque.

The officers located a pet shop “CITY OCEAN” at S125, “Kip Mart Tampoi”, and found a range of bird food within the shop. SSSGT Fathli asked two shopkeepers within the shop if they knew of something called “Cas Cas” which could be mixed with bird food to enhance the singing of birds, but they replied that they had never heard of “Cas Cas”. SSSGT Fathli proceeded to purchase one packet of each of the five types of bird food available at “CITY OCEAN”.

They approached two such shops but the shopkeepers informed the officers that they had never heard of “Cas Cas”.

She informed SSSGT Fathli that she only had “Cas Cas” in a form which was powdered and pre-mixed with other spices, and that it was meant for cooking. She further indicated that it was illegal to sell the seed form of “Cas Cas”. If authorities were to find any shop selling the seed form, that shop would be given a fine. SSSGT Fathli proceeded to purchase 400 g for RM 28. The officers then explored the shops at “Kip Mart Tampoi” for other bird shops or rice shops, but found none.

The Accused was then shown a photograph of the powder purchased from “REMPAH KARI VALLIS” (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>P151).

I find also that the Accused departed dramatically from the account given in his recorded statements, where he stated only that he had felt A1 and A2 on the morning of 31 December 2014, without any further indication that (i) he had also felt them on the night of 30 December 2014 just after receiving them and found them “grainy or sandy”; (ii) saw “the shape of the packet which is like bird food”; (iii) saw that the colour of the contents was “dark”; and (iv) saw that the shape of the item was “coarse” or “granular”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I reject the Accused’s varying accounts of how he felt, saw or otherwise attempted to examine the contents of A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A. The incoherence of his evidence utterly undermines its believability. I am led to the conclusion based on the totality of the evidence that either the Accused already knew what the contents of those packets were prior to collecting them and therefore did not carry out further checks after having collected them, or he had checked, felt and/or taken a look at the items after collecting them and knew what they were. I find it hard to believe that he would not have had a good opportunity to examine the items for himself and that he would not have even taken a good look at the items when he put them inside his wife’s car, retrieved them the next day, threw away the extra plastic bags and thereafter, placed the items under the car seat. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The presumptions under ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 There is no dispute on the applicable legal principles.

</div> It therefore suffices for me to set out the key principles and the relevant cases. I will then summarise these principles by way of a framework that sets out the steps to be followed to determine whether the presumptions in ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA apply and, if so, whether they have been rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The relevant sections of the MDA read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Section 18(1) identifies four scenarios in which an accused will be presumed to have had the controlled drug in his possession. Under s 18(2), where he is presumed (or proved) to have had the drug in his possession, another presumption is triggered. The accused is, until the contrary is proved, presumed to have known the nature of the drug. The phrase “the nature of that drug” under s 18(2) refers to the actual controlled drug found in the bag or container that was in the possession of the accused: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [24]. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>held that to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, the accused would have to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The subsequent decision of <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>involved an appellant who was charged under s 7 of the MDA for importing diamorphine. The Court of Appeal held that the presumption of possession under s 18(1) was triggered because the appellant was in physical possession of a brown packet containing the controlled drug. The appellant argued that he did not have the controlled drug in the brown packet in his possession because he did not know that the brown packet contained a controlled drug. On the facts, the Court of Appeal rejected this submission.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In relation to the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, the Court of Appeal held (at [18]) that the accused “bears the burden of prov[ing] on a balance of probabilities that he did not know <span class="font-italic">or could not reasonably be expected to have known</span> the nature of the controlled drug that was found inside the Brown Packet [emphasis added]”. It found that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption through his mere assertion that he did not know what was in the brown packet, when (a) he did not believe that the brown packet contained what he was told it did (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>food); and (b) he had ample time and opportunity to open the brown packet to see what it contained. He did not bother to take the simple step of peeping into the brown packet to see what it contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal. The Court of Appeal then held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 In our view, the appellant has failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption on a balance of probabilities because <span class="font-italic">he turned a blind eye to what the Brown Packet contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal</span>. The factual distinction between this case and<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>is that in the latter case, the accused did not have any suspicion that he was carrying anything other than erimin and ketamine (which the court accepted). In contrast, in the present case, the appellant was aware that he was carrying something illegal, and he could easily have verified what that thing was by simply opening the Brown Packet. It was not enough for the appellant to take the position that he did not open the Brown Packet because he had been told not to do so. <span class="font-italic">In using the expression “turning a blind eye” in this context, we do not mean to say that the appellant had actual knowledge that the Brown Packet contained diamorphine. In the context of s 18(2) of the MDA, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to prove wilful blindness as a means of proving actual knowledge on the appellant’s part of the nature of the controlled drug in the Brown Packet as the Prosecution has no such burden. Instead, it is for the appellant to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that the Brown Packet contained diamorphine.</span> In our view, the appellant has failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption by his mere general assertions that he did not know what was in the Brown Packet as: (a) the nature of the controlled drug in that packet could easily have been determined by simply opening the packet; and (b) there was no evidence to show that it was not reasonably expected of him, in the circumstances, to open the packet to see what was in it. In short, <span class="font-italic">the appellant has failed to prove the contrary of what s 18(2) of the MDA presumes in the present case as he neglected or refused to take reasonable steps to find out what he was asked to deliver to Ah Boy on 19 December 2009 in circumstances where a reasonable person having the suspicions that he had would have taken steps to find out (</span>viz<span class="font-italic">, by simply opening the Brown Packet to see what was in it).</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan</span>”), the Court of Appeal described (at [75]) the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai </span>as a refinement of the principles applicable to the rebuttal of the presumption of knowledge. The Court of Appeal also observed that it was accepted in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai </span>that an accused would not be able to rebut the presumption by a mere assertion of his lack of knowledge had he been wilfully blind as to the nature of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In relation to the doctrine of wilful blindness, it suffices for me to adopt the clear and succinct exposition set out by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>(at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span> at [141], this court held that s 18(2) of the MDA included both <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge </span>in its “purest form” (also referred to as “actual knowledge <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>” in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lim Boon Hiong</span> [2010] 4 SLR 696 as well as <span class="font-italic">wilful blindness</span>. However, one must be careful to avoid unnecessary refinement of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of knowledge. Wilful blindness (or “Nelsonian blindness”) is merely “lawyer-speak” for <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> that is <span class="font-italic">inferred</span> from the circumstances of the case. It is an indirect way to prove actual knowledge; <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, actual knowledge is proved because the inference of knowledge is <span class="font-italic">irresistible</span> and is the <span class="font-italic">only rational inference</span> available <span class="font-italic">on the facts</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions</span> (1988) 63 ALJR 1 at 3). It is a subjective concept, in that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of the <span class="font-italic">accused</span> and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused (although this last-mentioned point may not be an irrelevant consideration) (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). Wilful blindness is not negligence or an inadvertent failure to make inquiries. It refers to the blindness of a person to facts which, in the relevant context, he <span class="font-italic">deliberately refuses</span> to inquire into. Such failure to inquire may sustain an inference of knowledge of the actual or likely existence of the relevant drug. It must also be emphasised that where the Prosecution seeks to rely on actual knowledge in the form of wilful blindness, the alleged wilful blindness must be <span class="font-italic">proved</span><span class="font-italic"> beyond a reasonable doubt</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A framework for applying ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I believe it is useful to summarise these principles and set out, in the interest of clarity, the approach to be used in the application of ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Prosecution may choose either to prove that the accused was in possession of the controlled drug, or may rely on s 18(1) of the MDA to raise a presumption that the accused possessed the controlled drug. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In order to prove that the accused possessed the controlled drug, the Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused not only had physical control over the item but also that the accused knew or was aware that the item was a controlled drug: <span class="font-italic">Fun Seong Cheng v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 796 at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 1 SLR (R) 1 at [87].

However, I reiterate the crucial differences between the two matters. ... Wilful blindness, as “lawyer-speak” for actual knowledge inferred from the circumstances, must be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> at [30], a finding of wilful blindness must be “an irresistible inference” and “the only rational inference available on the facts”. Furthermore, a decision not to make specific inquiries must be a deliberate one and assessed subjectively. In contrast, to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the accused bears the burden of showing that on a balance of probabilities he or she did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the drug in his or her possession. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span> at [21], this depends on whether in the circumstances, a reasonable person having the same suspicions as the accused would have taken steps to find out its nature. In other words, the accused’s conduct is measured against that of a reasonable person in his or her shoes. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I agree with the above observations of Hoo JC. In my view, it is of critical importance to maintain a clear analytical distinction between the doctrine of wilful blindness and the expression “turning a blind eye” used in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>, despite their lexical similarities. The former is a means of proving actual knowledge, and the latter arises within the inquiry of whether the accused could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug. Where the former is proven (beyond reasonable doubt), the Prosecution does not need to rely on the s 18(2) presumption at all. The latter becomes relevant only when the Prosecution relies on the s 18(2) presumption and the accused seeks to rebut that presumption (on the balance of probabilities). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I find that s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA raises a presumption that the Accused was in possession of A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A at the material time. The Accused was at all times in physical possession of A1 and A2, which contained A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A. He placed A1 and A2 under the rear passenger seats in Yusmazina’s car. He was the only person who knew where they were concealed when he entered Singapore together with them, prior to the search conducted by ICA officers on Yusmazina’s car. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I do not consider that the Accused has succeeded in rebutting the presumption of his possession of the controlled drugs under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. The Accused had full physical control of A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A. He planted them in Yusmazina’s car, and could have moved them from their hidden location anytime he saw it fit to do so. In my judgment, the Accused also had the requisite mental element for possession. As I have explained at [47] to [68] above, the First Contemporaneous Statement is convincing evidence that the Accused knew that A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A were controlled drugs. The Accused has not, for any of the reasons he has given, succeeded in casting doubt on the accuracy of the First Contemporaneous Statement and the veracity of the answers given therein as a true reflection of the Accused’s knowledge at the time the statement was recorded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The presumption of knowledge of the specific nature of the drug in the accused’s possession under s 18(2) of the MDA is therefore triggered. The Accused is presumed to have known the nature of the drug, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A contain diamorphine. In attempting to rebut the presumption, the Accused argues that he had “not the slightest suspicion” that the drugs were present in the plastic bags handed over to him on 31 December 2014.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Accused’s closing submissions at para 131. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, the Accused alleges that he thought A1 and A2 felt or looked like “Cas Cas”, that he had reason to trust Ali and that Ali had manipulated him. I have considered these submissions as well as the Prosecution’s responses at [69] to [98] above, and found that the circumstances were such that the Accused, and any reasonable person in his position, would have every reason to regard the items received and the instructions to import them into Singapore with the deepest misgivings. I have also explained (at [98] to [106] above) my reasons for my finding that the Accused did not take any sufficient steps to allay his suspicions. The evidence provided by the Accused in this regard was a catalogue of inconsistencies, embellishments and half-truths. This not only tarnished his credibility but also cast serious doubt on whether the Accused had in fact taken any measures whatsoever to ascertain the contents of A1A1, A1B1 or A2A1A1A.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In the circumstances, I find that the Accused has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, either by showing on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the controlled drug or that he could not reasonably be expected to have had such knowledge. This is precisely a case in which the Accused “turned a blind eye” to the contents of A1 and A2. A reasonable person in his position would have made further enquiries about A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A, or at the very least would have removed them from A1 and A2 to obtain a proper view of them. It is significant that the brownish granular substance in A1A1 and A1B1 was wrapped in <span class="font-italic">transparent</span> packaging and hence readily visible without having to remove any of the wrapping. It is inconceivable that a reasonable person would have been satisfied with the contrived and wholly deficient ways in which the Accused claimed to have inspected the items – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a momentary sighting of their texture, a glimpse of their shape, and a fleeting impression of their colour, seen in the dark. It is also difficult to believe that after handling the items and after having felt the texture of the items, the Accused would not have realised that the items were much too coarse to be bird food mixed with “Cas Cas”, which would ordinarily have raised suspicions. These suspicions would have prompted the Accused to examine the items further to see if they were indeed bird food mixed with “Cas Cas” that he had been asked to bring into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Given these facts, I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was wilfully blind as to the contents of A1A1, A1B1 and A2A1A1A. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Concluding remarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 For the above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has succeeded in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused committed the offence of importation of a controlled drug, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 44.75 g of diamorphine, into Singapore under s 7 of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In reaching this conclusion, I bear well in mind that the Accused’s importation of diamorphine was accompanied by the entry of his wife and two brothers-in-law into Singapore, as well as the simultaneous importation of 200 live birds hidden under the front seats. The Accused relies on these as circumstantial evidence: if he had known that he was importing such a significant quantity of drugs into Singapore, he would not have put his wife and brothers-in-law at risk of arrest, nor would he have increased the chances of arousing the suspicion of ICA officers by bringing in so many live birds. There is some degree of persuasiveness to these arguments. But in the final calculus, I do not consider these circumstances to be determinative. They are equally consistent with the scheme of a shrewd and determined man to reduce suspicion by travelling with his family, and to furnish the basis for a claim that A1 and A2 contained nothing more than bird food. To my mind, they ultimately do not provide sufficient traction for the Accused to rebut the presumptions. The Accused is guilty as charged and I convict him accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chee Min Ping and Jason Chua (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Kanagavijayan Nadarajan and Ranadhir Gupta (A Zamzam &amp; Co., Kana &amp; Co.) for the Accused.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
