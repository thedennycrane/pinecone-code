</div> I disagree with this proposition, and I deal with the authorities Sunrise relies upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">South Caribbean Trading Ltd v Trafigura </span><span class="font-italic">Beheever BV </span>[2004] All ER (D) 334 (Nov), parties entered an agreement whereby the plaintiff (“SCT”) was to sell to the defendant (“Trafigura”) some barrels of oil. One of the issues which the court considered was whether the date of delivery under one of the contracts had been agreed to be varied. In a telephone conversation, Trafigura’s representative promised that the letter of credit would be extended. Sunrise highlights the court’s finding that (at [105]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the assent of [Trafigura] to the extension of the letter of credit until 30 June expiring July 2001 was an effective variation of Contract 5536 to that effect. That is because it was a new agreement supported by mutual promises - on the part of Trafigura to accept delivery of product at a date different from 31 March at a fixed price and on the part of SCT that, the blending operation having been much delayed, would successfully be completed by the new delivery date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, this was not a statement of legal principle but simply a factual finding in the context of that case. SCT’s case was that “on 14 and 15 March 2001 it was agreed between [SCT] and [Trafigura] that the time for delivery by SCT under Contract 5536 was to be extended from 31 March to 30 June with Trafigura's letter of credit to be amended consistently with the former to permit shipment up to 30 June and its validity for presentation of documents to be up to 15 July 2001” (at [54]). The extension of the letter of credit was consequential to an agreement to amend the underlying contract. It was not SCT’s case that the agreement to extend the letter of credit was, <span class="font-italic">in itself</span>, a variation of the underlying contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">W.J. Alan</span> <span class="font-italic">&amp; Co. Ltd</span><span class="font-italic">. v El Nasr Export and Import Co. </span>[1972] 2 QB 189, Lord Denning M.R. held that, where one party to a contract has by his conduct induced the other party to believe that he will not insist on his strict legal rights under a contract, he has waived his rights and cannot afterwards insist on them if the other party has acted on that belief differently from how he would have otherwise acted. This case is not relevant as Sunrise confirmed during the trial that its case was that the Supply Contract had been varied, not that OKI had waived Sunrise’s breach.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">China Resources (S) Pte Ltd v Magenta Resources (S) Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 103 (“<span class="font-italic">China Resources</span>”), the letter of credit was amended to provide for a last date of shipment on 14 December 1991. The Court of Appeal found that the sellers were in breach of contract when they failed to deliver by this date (at [31]). However, the fact that the underlying contract had been initially varied to provide for a 14 December 1991 deadline was not disputed. There is no suggestion in this case that the last delivery date under a letter of credit is conceptually the same as the delivery date under the underlying sale of goods contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 <span class="font-italic">Hartley v Hymans </span>[1920] 3 KB 475 is also not of assistance to Sunrise. Sunrise relies on McCardie J’s holding that the buyer was estopped from saying that the delivery period had expired on the contractually stipulated date, or from asserting that the contract had ceased to be valid on that date. McCardie J held that the buyer’s conduct, in requesting delivery after the expiry date, had led the seller to believe that the contract was still subsisting, and the seller had acted on that belief to great expense. This is not relevant to the present case. Sunrise is not alleging estoppel but a variation of the Supply Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Thus, none of the authorities cited by Sunrise stand for the proposition which it argues is “trite”. Certainly, as a factual matter, when parties agree to vary the required delivery dates under a sale of goods contract, they will almost certainly amend the delivery date on any letter of credit accordingly. Otherwise, the letter of credit would serve no practical purpose. The seller will not be able to receive payment even though he has complied with the contractual deadline. Nonetheless, <span class="font-italic">the converse does not necessarily follow</span>. While the agreement to extend the delivery date under a letter of credit could mean that parties had reached an agreement to vary the underlying contract, it could also indicate that the buyer was, while willing to accept delivery and make payment, reserving his rights to recover damages caused by the seller’s delay. In order to pay for the Goods and fulfil his own obligations under the contract, he would have to amend the letter of credit accordingly. Therefore, the amendments to LC1 and LC2, and the negotiations leading up to those amendments, are significant only as part of the factual matrix from which I must ascertain if Sunrise and OKI agreed to vary the Delivery Dates under the Supply Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis of factual matrix</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Coming to the factual matrix, I first consider the correspondence between the parties surrounding the amendments to LC1 and the opening of LC2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 LC1 was issued on 24 September 2015.

It cannot be fairly said, however, that there was any acceptance on the part of OKI. When OKI agreed to amend the last date of shipment in LC1 and opened LC2 with a last date of shipment after the Delivery Date, it was simply ensuring that Sunrise could receive payment under the letters of credit so that Sunrise would ship the Goods, as it was already obliged to do. OKI’s correspondence reflected vexed indulgence, rather than agreement in a contractual sense. It was not forgoing its right to liquidated damages for delivery after the Delivery Dates stated in Clause 5.1. None of the correspondence between the parties suggests that OKI had done so. Nor was there any reason why it would do so. As expressed in their e-mail at [41] above, the deadlines were important to them. As I explained at [35] above, parties may have good reasons for agreeing to extend the validity and last shipment date of a letter of credit <span class="font-italic">without</span> agreeing to a change in the deadline in the underlying contract. Sunrise has adduced insufficient evidence to prove that OKI’s agreement to amend the letters of credit was anything more than just that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In this context, it is important to note that the Supply Contract expressly set out a process for the variation of Delivery Dates.

</div> This does not assist Sunrise. Even if Clause 5.1 had not been varied, Sunrise was entitled to payment under the letters of credit because it had delivered the Goods to OKI. Clause 5.1 did not entitle OKI to withhold 80% of the contract price if the Delivery Dates were not met.

</div> However, <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Zhipeng </span>does not stand for this proposition. In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Zhipeng</span>, the appellant’s case as set out in his statement of claim was based on a purported deed of guarantee by the respondent. In response, the respondent pleaded that “she never intended the Guarantee to be a Deed of Guarantee … and/or there was no consideration for the [Respondent] signing the Guarantee” (at [49]). This was denied by the appellant in his reply. The trial judge held that the purported deed was invalid, and therefore the guarantee would only be enforceable if it was supported by consideration. The trial judge dismissed the appellant’s claim because consideration had not been adequately pleaded in his statement of claim (at [19]). The Court of Appeal disagreed, and held at [54] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Given that the issue of consideration was not raised until the Respondent filed her Defence and Counterclaim, it would not have been appropriate for the Appellant to pre-empt the issue and raise in it in his statement of claim. This is particularly so as the Appellant’s claim was premised on a “<span class="font-italic">deed</span> of guarantee” [emphasis added], for which consideration was not required for validity. We add that even if the claim was not premised on a deed, it is not necessary for a plaintiff to plead consideration until the absence of consideration is raised as a defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Zhipeng</span> stands for the proposition that a plaintiff cannot be faulted for failing to expressly plead consideration in its statement of claim. It does not stand for the proposition that a defendant is only entitled to raise lack of consideration if it has been pleaded. <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Zhipeng</span> is therefore irrelevant in this case – OKI is not suggesting that Sunrise’s claim should fail due to its failure to identify consideration in its statement of claim. It is Sunrise that is suggesting that OKI’s defence which involves an absence of consideration ought to have been pleaded. To consider this issue, Sunrise’s statement of claim is relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In Sunrise’s statement of claim, it pleaded that it “completed its performance of its contractual obligations under the Supply Contracts in a timely fashion in the month of February 2016” at para 7. At para 30, it pleaded that it had not breached any of the terms of the Supply Contracts and that it had completed its obligations under the Supply Contracts. It did <span class="font-italic">not</span> expressly refer to any variation of the Delivery Dates in the Supply Contract. With no allegation of a variation of the Supply Contract, OKI could not respond in its defence that there was a lack of consideration for that variation. Sunrise’s position is thus that OKI ought to have amended its defence, or filed a rejoinder, after Sunrise raised in its reply the allegation that the latest dates of shipment in the Supply Contract had been extended. Neither option would have been appropriate given that Sunrise itself did not amend its statement of claim to incorporate reference to the variation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Thus, there is nothing preventing OKI from arguing that the purported variation of the Supply Contracts was not supported by consideration. Sunrise relies on this variation, and the onus is on Sunrise to establish that the Supply Contracts were validly varied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Sunrise’s second alternative contention is that Clause 5.2 dispensed with the need for any consideration.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin</span> accepted at [36] that parties could, by agreement, dispense with the requirement of consideration. Sunrise argues that Clause 5.2 did so dispense with consideration. A plain reading of the Clause (see [50] above), with its reference to compensation in the second and third paragraphs, reflects that it was envisaged that consideration be discussed between parties when the clause was exercised. I have held at [51] that Sunrise did not issue the requisite notice under the clause, and thus Clause 5.2 would in any event be inapplicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As a third alternative, Sunrise argues that there was consideration. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin </span>accepted at [65] that any factual benefit (in line with <span class="font-italic">Williams v Roffey Bros &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd</span> [1991] 1 QB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>”)) could satisfy the requirement of consideration. Sunrise’s position is that very little is required by way of consideration where parties are in a commercial relationship (see <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [102]–[103]). Only a practical benefit is required and Sunrise cites the practical benefit OKI received from the receipt of the Goods. It relies upon <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> where the factual benefit of the timely performance of the contract was considered consideration for an increase in the contract price. Of course, in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span>, parties had come to an agreement. In the present case I have held that parties did not have such an agreement. As such, there was no properly accepted delivery date. Instead, OKI was faced, on a rolling basis, with continued tardiness. No factual benefit was conferred by Sunrise’s continual delay. Nor did Sunrise offer anything in exchange for OKI agreeing to extended timelines; they simply assumed that OKI would accept the situation. With no proper renegotiation or fresh bargain struck, while Sunrise did eventually supply all the material it had promised to supply, the lateness remained a breach for which variation would have required fresh factual benefit. The facts of this case are more akin to <span class="font-italic">Foakes</span><span class="font-italic"> v Beer</span> (1884) 9 App Cas 605, where it was held that a promise to accept part payment of a debt was unenforceable for lack of consideration, than to <span class="font-italic">Williams</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on delay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I therefore find that the Delivery Dates within Clause 5.1 of Annex III were not varied.

</div> OKI and Sunrise were aware that the specifications in the Specification Clauses of the Supply Contract were to be preliminary, and revisions were to be made after selection of supplies. There was no agreement to reduce the contract price in the event that smaller manholes were needed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 This arrangement was necessary because the precise specifications of the manholes depended upon measurements on the ground as well as the condition of the ground. Mr Horison accepted in cross-examination that the site was a green field area on an island. The manholes were to be installed underground, and the ground condition such as its gradient and the existence of plants would affect the size of manhole needed. He thus accepted that standard size manholes would not be appropriate, and the required specifications could only be finalised once someone made measurements on site.

</div> However, his evidence was not consonant with the documentation. The context behind OKI’s acceptance of the revised drawings is as follows. In early September 2015, a dispute arose between OKI and Sunrise about the specifications of the manholes. Sunrise sent OKI a document dated 8 September 2015 (the “MTO”) containing certain specifications. However, Sunrise later pointed out that the specifications in the MTO did not match the drawings which had been approved by OKI’s technical team. On 17 September 2015, Mr Alain Dion from OKI’s technical team proposed that a set of manhole drawings be printed and initialled for inclusion in the Supply Contract, and that “Sunrise should list as part of their MTO and for each manhole the diameter and height so that the MTO would match with the drawings”.

</div> This reflects the initial agreement Sunrise and OKI’s technical team had prior to the contract, and shows that the specifications in the drawings were to take precedence. Following this, on 21 September 2015, Mr Horison sent an e-mail to Mr Michael Wong (“Mr Wong”), the person in charge of the Project. In this e-mail he asked Mr Wong to confirm which specifications should be used: those in the signed MTO, or those in the drawings which had not been signed by OKI. He highlighted that some manholes manufactured based on the drawings had heights below two metres, when the price of the Supply Contract had been calculated based on a minimum height of two metres (the specification in the MTO).

</div> Thus, the pricing and specifications of the manholes had been specifically accepted by the technical team both prior to contract and in its fulfilment. Mr Atanu was then informed also on 24 September 2015. Sunrise and OKI’s technical team worked together on the various drawings up to 10 November 2015.

Any personal opposition that Mr Horison had to this was never acted upon by OKI. However, when the Supply Contract was signed on 28 September 2015, it appears that there must have been a mistake because the Specification Clauses included the specifications from the MTO. Nevertheless, it is clear that the intention to use the specifications in the revised drawings remained. As counsel for OKI rightly conceded, OKI would have been extremely vexed if the manholes had been delivered per the specifications in the MTO because they would not have been usable for the plant.

</div> Thus, OKI received precisely what it bargained for: manholes which could be used on the plant with specifications that had been approved by its technical team. The claim that Sunrise supplied non-compliant manholes is not genuine, and this will be made even more clear when I consider the manner in which OKI calculated its apparent loss arising from this alleged breach, which I deal with in passing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67  OKI seeks damages in respect of Sunrise’s supply of non-compliant manholes in the sum of US$584,496.

OKI argues that smaller manholes have a lower value since less material would be used to make them.

</div> There, an agreement was reached for the defendant to, amongst other things, allow the plaintiff to drive 6000km in its Formula 1 car. Ultimately, the defendant only allowed the plaintiff to drive 2004km. In awarding damages, the court held that “loss is to be assessed by reference to the value of the kilometres and associated benefits which should have been but were not provided” (at [487]). However, the court went on to explain that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The assessment of that value is a matter of evidence. The value of the withheld benefits is not the same as or determined by, and is indeed conceptually quite distinct from, the contract price. The contract price may in an appropriate case be part of the evidence from which an inference may be capable of being drawn as to the value of the withheld services, but it may not. If there is evidence that the contract represented a good deal for the Claimant, in that he acquired the right to the services contracted for for a price lower than the market price or their market value, any inference as to market value that might otherwise be drawn from the contract price must yield to such evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it. Equally if the evidence shows that it was a bad deal for the Claimant the contract price must yield to such evidence as the more reliable source from which to draw inferences as to value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, the court’s ultimate concern was the <span class="font-italic">market value</span> of the benefit not provided. The contract price was simply one piece of evidence that was relevant. Further, <span class="font-italic">Giedo</span><span class="font-italic"> Van Der Garde BV</span> does not stand for the proposition that the market value of a non-provided benefit can be assumed to be directly proportionate to the contract price. Admittedly, the damages awarded in <span class="font-italic">Giedo</span><span class="font-italic"> Van Der Garde BV</span> were directly proportionate to the benefit lost. The court held that the plaintiff had not been provided the benefit of 3,730km out of 6,000km, and thus there was a 62.17% loss in this regard. The value of this lost benefit was held to be $1,865,000 (at [498]), which is 62.17% of $3m, which was the contract price (at [3]). However, it is clear that the court arrived at this conclusion after considering expert evidence on the value of driving 4,000km in a Formula 1 car (see [488]–[494]), and did not do so by assumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 There was no such expert evidence adduced by OKI as to the market value of the manholes. There was therefore nothing to suggest that the value of the manholes was directly proportionate to their size. In fact, the prices charged for the manholes under the Supply Contract suggested that their values were <span class="font-italic">not </span>directly proportionate to their size. For example, OK-01’s size would be 0.7668m3. OK-06’s size would be 7.52m3. Thus, OK-06 was 9.81 times the size of OK-06. However, the price of OK-06 under the Supply Contract (US$25,751) was only 6.90 times of OK-01’s price (US$3,734). Therefore, I do not accept that the market value of the manholes can be obtained simply by reference to their size. OKI did not contract for the supply of manholes to be resold to a third party. Conversely, OKI contracted for the supply of goods it required to install in the Mill. The manholes were custom-drawn and built, and there is no evidence that they were not installed by PT Piping. Nor is there any evidence that the manholes failed to serve the purpose upon installation due to their specifications. I should mention that while Mr Horison stated that OKI spent IDR7,080,400 (roughly US$453) to modify the manholes for use,

</div> This argument is misconceived. First, a party does not need to prove loss to entitle itself to liquidated damages. This would defeat the purpose of liquidated damages, which are intended to “facilitate recovery of damages without the difficulty and expense of proving actual damage”: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Hugh G.

Second, it cannot reasonably be said that the fact that the Mill is now in operation and the Goods have all been used means that OKI has suffered no loss. They received the Goods late, and one can generally expect losses to flow from that fact. That is precisely why Clause 6.1 of Annex III exists in the Supply Contract.

</div> OKI did so on or about 24 May 2017. Clause 16.1(c) also provides that should the Supply Contract be terminated by OKI, Sunrise was to return all paid payments received with 12% annual interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I reject OKI’s submission. Its entitlement to unilaterally terminate the Supply Contract arose when the Goods were delayed by more than six weeks, which was in January 2016 for Supply Contract A1 and February 2016 for Supply Contract A2. The fact is that, at that point in time, OKI did not terminate the Supply Contract. Instead, OKI agreed to amend the letters of credit such that they could make payment for Sunrise’s delivery of the Goods. Having elected not to exercise its entitlement to terminate the Supply Contract in January or February 2016, and allowing OKI to ship the Goods, OKI was no longer entitled to rely on Clause 16.1(c). Clause 16.1(c) clearly envisages a situation in which the Goods had not yet been shipped, or in which the Goods were non-functional. Neither situation is applicable here. Sunrise points out that the letters of credit expired on 21 March 2016, and delivery was only completed on 24 March 2016. Thus, in order for OKI’s bank to make payment to Sunrise, OKI would have to authorise payment despite the discrepancy.

</div> The Certificate of Performance Test Acceptance would only be issued upon <span class="font-italic">Sunrise’s</span> completion of installation works – and this never happened in light off Sunrise’s repudiation of the Installation Contract.

In <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131], the Court of Appeal endorsed, among others, the following canons as a guide for interpreting contracts: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The interpretation exercise is based on the whole contract and is a holistic approach. Courts are not excessively focused on a particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause.

If Sunrise’s obligations did not extend to personally installing the Goods, there would be no reason for them to be denied any part of the contract price as long as the Goods were installed and were in good working condition. The preamble to the Supply Contract states that Sunrise is “willing and able to sell and deliver the [Goods] to [OKI] in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in [the Supply Contract]”.

</div> None of the clauses therein refer to an obligation on the part of Sunrise to install the Goods. Of course, this is entirely understandable given that parties had agreed a separate Installation Contract. Even looking at Clauses 3.1 and 11 in isolation, there is no clear indication that the Goods must be installed by Sunrise. I therefore do not accept that, on an objective interpretation of the Supply Contract as a whole, installation fell within Sunrise’s obligations. Thus, my interpretation of Clause 3.1 is not one whereby Sunrise is only entitled to full payment if it <span class="font-italic">personally</span> completes the installation works. The final 10% is payable as long as OKI has certified that the relevant performance guarantees and conditions as defined in Clause 1 of Annex III of the Supply Contract

</div>
</div>
</div> In response to Sunrise’s claim for the final 10%, OKI did not allege that any of the Goods were faulty or did not meet the performance requirements stated in the Supply Contract. It simply relies on the fact that no Certificate of Performance Acceptance Test in the narrow sense (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one issued by OKI in respect of installation works carried out by Sunrise) has been issued. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Goods complied with the performance guarantees and conditions, and therefore Sunrise is entitled to the balance 10% of the Supply Contract price.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sunrise’s entitlement under the Bank Guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Bank Guarantee was issued pursuant to the Supply Contract. It is undisputed that OKI had paid up to 90% under the Supply Contract at the time that OKI called on the Bank Guarantee. This was the amount that Sunrise was entitled to at that juncture, because its case relies on the certificate issued by PT Piping approved by OKI in June 2017.

</div> At the same point in time, based on my findings above, OKI was also entitled to liquidated damages of 10%.

</div>
</div> Sunrise argues that the timeline whereby mobilisation was to be completed by 21 September 2015 and installation work was to be completed by 31 January 2016 is inapplicable because it must be read with the specified shipping schedule, which provided that the Goods were only to begin arriving on 25 October 2015.

</div> However, Sunrise has not explained what the appropriate timeline is, or how it complied with it. I note that Sunrise accepts that 28 February 2016 was the appropriate “Start-Up Date” under Clause 5.1 of the Installation Contract, being the date beyond which delay of installation work entitled OKI to liquidated damages.

</div> There is no dispute that as of 28 February 2016, the installation work had not been completed by Sunrise. Thus, the relevance of this argument is unclear. Sunrise clearly failed to complete the installation works within the time stipulated in the Installation Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, Sunrise claims that it was ready, willing and able to perform the Installation Contract and did in fact perform some installation works. In this regard, Sunrise highlights that the following is clear from the correspondence between parties from November 2015 to April 2016:

Rather, its response is that it had performed some of its obligations, was willing to perform fully, but was unable to do so due to OKI’s conduct. Nevertheless, none of OKI’s conduct that Sunrise complains of amounted to a breach of the Installation Contract, nor did it constitute conduct for which Sunrise was entitled to delay performance under the Installation Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 A key aspect of the dispute between parties that led to Sunrise’s demobilisation concerned the accommodation facilities for Sunrise’s personnel. In an e-mail on 2 March 2016, Mr Thorat highlighted to OKI that the housing arrangements for Sunrise’s personnel were unsatisfactory, and that despite concerns having been raised with OKI, OKI was not remedying the situation. Sunrise’s personnel therefore had to stay in unsatisfactory conditions since 25 February 2016. In the circumstances, Sunrise had to hold off on further deployment of its manpower, and had to consider demobilising the team already in Indonesia until the housing issues had been solved.

He also told OKI that Sunrise would not be mobilising any further personnel unless and until it received confirmation on the availability of the requisite facilities.

</div> Sunrise did not plead the existence of such an understanding, nor was any documentation on its terms produced. In any case, even if there was such an understanding, there was nothing which prevented OKI from demanding advance payment for providing the services which were truly Sunrise’s responsibility under the Installation Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I accept that there was no prior agreement that Sunrise would pay in advance for accommodation provided by OKI. However, neither was there an agreement that OKI would not require advance payment. This is illustrated by the fact that, when OKI requested advance payment, Mr Thorat’s response was not that this was contrary to prior agreement, but that it had been put up for approval with management.

</div> Given that there was no agreement either way on advance payment, Sunrise was subject to OKI’s terms if it chose to rely on OKI to provide accommodation. When I raised this, counsel for Sunrise submitted that “if that’s a doubt, that can’t be used as a reason to terminate a contract … because both parties have not agreed to that.”

</div> That is precisely the point. The absence of an agreement either way about advance payment meant that Sunrise could not use it as a reason to demobilise from the Project Site and neglect its obligations under the Installation Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Based on the terms of the Installation Contract, Sunrise had no basis to expect that OKI would provide its personnel with accommodation or food services. Therefore, dissatisfaction with the state of the accommodation which OKI nevertheless agreed to provide, or with the payment terms offered by OKI, did not entitle Sunrise to delay its performance under the Installation Contract. OKI’s conduct did not constitute a breach of the Installation Contract, which said nothing about its provision of accommodation for Sunrise’s personnel. What Sunrise did in response, however, was a breach of the Installation Contract. Sunrise demobilised its personnel from the Project Site which prevented it from performing its obligation to install the Goods.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was OKI entitled to terminate the Installation Contract?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Given that Sunrise breached the Installation Contract, the next question is whether OKI was, as a result of that breach, entitled to terminate the Installation Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is first important to identify when exactly the Installation Contract was terminated. There are three possible dates. First, there is 24 May 2017, when OKI’s solicitors served on Sunrise a “NOTICE OF TERMINATION”.

</div> The position changed, however, with OKI’s 18 May 2016 e-mail. In this e-mail, OKI made clear that it did not wish for Sunrise to perform the installation works. A few days later, OKI engaged another company to perform the installation works instead (see [11] above). Thus, at this point, OKI had elected to terminate the Installation Contract in response to Sunrise’s breach. Because the Installation Contract was terminated as at this date, it follows that the later notice of termination issued by OKI’s lawyers was of no effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 OKI submits that it was entitled to terminate the Installation Contract for two reasons.

The installation works were not completed by 28 February 2016, the stipulated Start-up Date, and they remained uncompleted when the Installation Contract was terminated on 18 May 2016.

</div> Sunrise informed OKI that despite repeated reminders and requests, it had not received payment “as per the terms and conditions of the contract”, and hence it would “not be interested to continue the contract”. Sunrise then stated that, if OKI was interested, it could amend its order in the following respects:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) extend the contract for delivery and installation; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) release the final 10% payment for the Supply Contract; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) release 100% payment for the Installation Contract under an irrevocable letter of credit.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This e-mail is unambiguous. Sunrise had no intention of abiding by the terms of the Installation Contract. It was requesting that OKI do what it was not contractually required to do, whether by the Supply Contract or the Installation Contract. As explained at [4] above, the final 10% under the Supply Contract was only payable upon the issuance of a Certificate of Performance Test, which at this point had not been issued. As for the Installation Contract, Sunrise was only entitled to payment of the first 20% after its supervisor had been working on the Project Site continuously for two months (see [6] above). If OKI did not comply with Sunrise’s requests, it was not interested to continue the Installation Contract. Sunrise has not put forward any other characterisation of this e-mail. This e-mail cannot be reasonably characterised in any other manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In addition, by the time this e-mail was sent, Sunrise had already demobilised its team and had made clear that it would not remobilise until OKI arranged for accommodation (see [95] above). As explained, OKI had no obligation under the Installation Contract to do so. Further, Sunrise had stated that the delays to the installation works were due to OKI’s failure to release payment under LC1 A1.

</div> OKI therefore had no obligation under the Installation Contract to release payment under the Supply Contract. By stating that this was a reason for the delay in installation works, Sunrise was effectively telling OKI that it would only perform if OKI complied with its unilaterally imposed condition to make payment under a separate contract. A reasonable person would certainly conclude that Sunrise no longer intended to be bound by the Installation Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 OKI was therefore entitled to terminate the Installation Contract when it did so on 18 May 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies under the Installation Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Liquidated damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Under Clause 6.1 read with Clause 6.2 of the Installation Contract, OKI is entitled to liquidated damages of up to 10% of the contract price if the installation work was delayed.

</div> I interpret this to mean that the delay referred to in Clause 6 is delay after 28 February 2016. The installation works were not completed by 28 February 2016, and they remained uncompleted when the Installation Contract was terminated on 18 May 2016. By this time, there had been more than six weeks of delay.

He simply reiterated that the cost ought to have been borne by Sunrise under the Installation Contract. In the circumstances, it is unclear whether or not OKI charged PT Piping the sum of US$441,224.
