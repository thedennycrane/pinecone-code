This, in turn, turned on the correct interpretation of the lodgement deadline provided under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “SOPA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 We held that the Judge was correct in deciding that the computation of the seven-day time limit (under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA) to file an adjudication application, after the entitlement to do so arises, <span class="font-italic">excludes</span> the day the entitlement arises. This would mean, in effect, that an adjudication applicant has eight days in total to lodge an adjudication application. Therefore, Adjudication Application No. SOP/AA 150 of 2023 was not lodged out of time.

Under paragraph 1 of Appendix C to the parties’ sub-contract, read with s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, HP was to provide a payment response by 20 June 2023 but failed to do so. Under s 12(6) of the SOPA, there is a seven-day dispute settlement period which was from 21 June to 27 June 2023. There was still no payment response from HP by 27 June 2023. MT lodged an adjudication application (Adjudication Application No. SOP/AA 150 of 2023) on 6 July 2023 under s 13 of the SOPA and the adjudicator issued his determination on 21 August 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 HP then filed an application in HC/OA 867/2023 on 28 August 2023 to set aside the adjudication determination on two grounds.

As a matter of ordinary language, the seven-day period after the entitlement arises will commence on the day after (<span class="font-italic">H P Construction (GD) </span>at [14]).

In the Judge’s view, this interpretation is consistent with the common law rule on calculation of dates, and consistent with s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “IA”) (<span class="font-italic">H P Construction (GD) </span>at [16]).

The appeal concerned the former scenario as no payment response was filed by HP. Here, the parties agreed that the dispute settlement period ended on 27 June 2023. The issue in contention is <span class="font-italic">from which date</span> the “7 days” timeline under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA to determine the lodgement deadline for the adjudication application is to be calculated. HP argued that it was to be calculated from (and inclusive of) 28 June 2023 while MT argued that it was to be calculated from 29 June 2023 because the day the entitlement to lodge the adjudication application arose, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> 28 June 2023, was <span class="font-italic">not</span> included in the computation. We also add that there was a public holiday on 29 June 2023 which was to be excluded from the computation of the seven-day period.  Under s 2 of the SOPA, “day” means “any day other than a public holiday”. That explains why the parties’ arguments were that the adjudication application lodgement period ended either on 5 or 6 July 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 HP provided a taxonomy of the various interpretations of the adjudication application lodgement timeline in their submissions for this appeal. There is, firstly, their preferred interpretation that the computation started from, and was inclusive of, 28 June 2023 (“HP’s Interpretation”). HP then pointed to MT’s interpretation that 28 June 2023 was <span class="font-italic">excluded</span> from the computation (“MT’s Interpretation”). HP also noted that there was a third possible interpretation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> that a payment claimant is entitled to lodge the adjudication application one day after the expiry of the dispute settlement period. In other words, MT was entitled to lodge the adjudication application <span class="font-italic">not</span> on 28 June but only from 29 June 2023 (had there not been a public holiday on this date). HP referred to this as the “Third Interpretation”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Third Interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 While the Third Interpretation appeared to be the same as MT’s Interpretation, it was not. Under MT’s Interpretation, MT was already entitled to lodge an adjudication application from 28 June 2023. However, for the purpose of computing the seven-day period under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, 28 June 2023 was excluded, and the computation of the deadline started only from 29 June 2023 (while bearing in mind that 29 June 2023 was a public holiday and hence an extra day should be added to the overall timeline). Under the Third Interpretation, MT was not entitled to lodge an adjudication application on 28 June 2023 and could do so only from 29 June 2023 (had 29 June 2023 not been a public holiday), the date from which the computation started. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 We rejected the Third Interpretation. As HP itself pointed out, the Third Interpretation would mean that there was a gap between 27 and 29 June 2023, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> 28 June 2023. We were of the view that there was no gap. Under s 12(2) of the SOPA, MT was entitled to make an adjudication application “if, by the end of the dispute settlement period, … the respondent does not provide the payment response …”. It was not disputed that that period ended on 27 June 2023. Hence, MT was entitled to make the adjudication application from 28 June 2023 and the Third Interpretation would be inconsistent with s 12(2).  That left only HP’s Interpretation and MT’s Interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">HP’s and MT’s Interpretations     </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Judge agreed with MT’s Interpretation.

She said that, “This application is to be made within 7 days …”. This was a reference to the adjudication application. In our view, this statement did not assist HP because it was not disputed that s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) mentions that the adjudication application must be made “within 7 days”. The question was from when the 7 days begins to run. Since MT was entitled to make an adjudication application from 28 June 2023, did the 7 days run from 28 June 2023 or one day after, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 29 June 2023 (leaving aside for the time being the fact that 29 June 2023 was a public holiday).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As MT argued at paragraph 3.3.7 of its written submissions, s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does not state that the adjudication application must be made within seven days “<span class="font-italic">after the end of the dispute settlement</span><span class="font-italic"> period</span>” [emphasis in original]. Rather, s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) states that the adjudication application must be made within 7 days “after the entitlement of the claimant to make an adjudication application first arises under section 12”. At first blush, the two may appear to mean the same thing and that may explain the views expressed in some cases. However, a closer analysis reveals that they are not the same. The dates in question are different – s 12(2) refers to the expiry of the dispute settlement period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 27 June 2023) while s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) refers to the date when the entitlement to file the adjudication application first arose (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 28 June 2023). These dates are a day apart with obvious implications for the long-stop date in s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It was not in dispute that the dispute settlement period ended on 27 June 2023. On 28 June 2023, MT was entitled to lodge an adjudication application, but MT’s position was that 28 June 2023 was excluded from computation of the adjudication application lodgement deadline. MT argued that its interpretation was supported by s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA. We set out s 50 of the IA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation of time</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">50.</span>  In computing time for the purposes of any written law, unless the contrary intention appears —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a period of days from the happening of an event or the doing of any act or thing is deemed to be exclusive of the day on which the event happens or the act or thing is done;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the last day of the period is a Sunday or a public holiday (which days are called in this section excluded days) the period includes the next following day not being an excluded day;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) when any act or proceeding is directed or allowed to be done or taken on a certain day, then, if that day happens to be an excluded day, the act or proceeding is considered as done or taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day afterwards, not being an excluded day;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) when any act or proceeding is directed or allowed to be done or taken within any time not exceeding 6 days, excluded days must not be reckoned in the computation of the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It was telling that HP did not dispute that s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA supported MT’s Interpretation. Furthermore, as the Judge found, and we agreed, MT’s Interpretation was consistent with the common law on the computation of time from a certain date which was to exclude the day of the event from the computation of a period within which a person must act upon that event. The common law was summarised in <span class="font-italic">Suresh s/o Suppiah v Jiang Guoliang</span> [2016] 4 SLR 645 (“<span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>”). HP also did not dispute the common law on the computation of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The court in <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>discussed the historical development of s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA and this provision’s codification of the common law position. The provision which is now found in s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA existed long before the enactment of the SOPA in 2004. As noted by the court at [82] of <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>, s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) can be traced back to the first legislative provision dealing with the computation of time in s 16 of the Interpretation Act 1867 passed by the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, which appears to codify the common principle then to exclude the first day in computing time. The drafters of the SOPA have drafted the SOPA against a statutory backdrop which includes the principles in the IA for the computation of time. Had the drafters of the SOPA intended to displace the time computation rules in s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA, it would be reasonable to expect explicit language to have been included.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 HP had cited <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>in support of its interpretation of the adjudication application lodgement timelines, on the basis that the court in <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>had “suggested that one way of viewing a cause of action which technically accrued at 0000 hours between two dates, would be to view the cause of action as not yet accruing at the last moment of the earlier date, and accruing at the first moment of the later date”. However, a close reading of <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>would show that it, in fact, supports MT’s Interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>was a case where the court had <span class="font-italic">applied </span>s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA. In <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>, the court had held that s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA applied in construing the computation of time under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (the “Limitation Act”) in the absence of provisions under the Limitation Act to explain the computation of time periods or to demonstrate a contrary intention: <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>at [29]–[36]. Crucially, at [26]–[28] and [56] of <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>, the court had also noted that there is a general principle of law that the law does not take into account fractions of a day, and thus, for the purpose of computing timelines under s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, the day of the date of accrual of the cause of action had to be <span class="font-italic">wholly</span> excluded. Transposing the <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>in <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>to the present matter, it was our view that the interaction between s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA and s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA would mirror the interaction between s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA and s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act: in calculating the deadline for making an adjudication application under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, the deadline calculation <span class="font-italic">excludes </span>the <span class="font-italic">entirety </span>of the day when the subject event happens, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the date when the entitlement to make the adjudication application under s 12 of the SOPA first arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In contrast, while the court in <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>had, at [53]–[54], left open the possibility of a situation where a cause of action could be viewed as “not yet accruing at the last moment of the earlier date, and accruing at the first moment of the later date”, the court stated that such a scenario “would arise only in rare technical situations” (at [53]), that such situations were “exceptional” (at [54]) and that the case which applied such a rule (<span class="font-italic">Gelmini</span><span class="font-italic"> v Moriggia</span> [1913] 2 KB 549) was not followed in the later case of <span class="font-italic">Marren</span><span class="font-italic"> v Dawson Bentley &amp; Co</span> Ltd [1961] 2 QB 135. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Therefore, <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span> did not support HP’s Interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The statutory purpose of the SOPA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 HP also relied on s 9A(1) of the IA which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Purposive interpretation of written law and use of extrinsic materials</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9A.</span>—(1)  In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) is to be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 HP argued that its interpretation would support the purpose of the SOPA which is to provide for an expeditious and low-cost adjudication system for parties in the construction industry to resolve disputes (although temporarily) while MT’s Interpretation does not support that purpose. This was because under MT’s Interpretation, an adjudication applicant had one additional day to lodge his adjudication application, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> effectively eight days instead of seven days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Even though MT’s Interpretation means that a claimant has one additional day to lodge his adjudication application, we rejected the submission that this suggested that HP’s Interpretation should therefore be preferred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, while s 9A(2) of the IA allows the consideration of extraneous material not forming part of the written law in the interpretation of that law, this is subject to the guidance mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [47] where the Court of Appeal said that a court may consider extraneous material in the three situations mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 at [65]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), to <span class="font-italic">confirm</span> that the ordinary meaning deduced is the correct and intended meaning having regard to any extraneous material that further elucidates the purpose or object of the written law;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), to <span class="font-italic">ascertain</span> the meaning of the text in question when the provision on its face is ambiguous or obscure; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     under s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii), to <span class="font-italic">ascertain</span> the meaning of the text in question where having deduced the ordinary meaning of the text as aforesaid, and considering the underlying object and purpose of the written law, such ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 HP did not argue that any part of the SOPA or the IA was ambiguous or obscure. Neither did it suggest that MT’s Interpretation was manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We add that while the purpose of the SOPA is to provide an expeditious adjudicative system to temporarily resolve disputes, it was a stretch to argue that the difference between the interpretations of HP and that of MT meant that HP’s Interpretation met the purpose of the SOPA while MT’s did not just because MT’s Interpretation would mean an extra one day to file an adjudication application. We maintained that view even though HP argued that the attendant consequence of applying MT’s Interpretation to another similarly-worded provision, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 17(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, would then mean a two-day delay in the computation of certain timelines under the SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In so far as HP argued that its interpretation was in harmony with other timelines in the SOPA which adopt a time period of seven days or multiples of seven days, MT pointed out that there are other timelines in the SOPA which do not follow such a pattern, such as the timelines in ss 8(3), 8(4), 22(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 26(4) and 26(5) of the SOPA. In any event, s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does use a seven-day timeline. The question was when the time starts to be computed. The fact that the adjudication applicant effectively gets eight days to lodge its adjudication application, while some of the other provisions effectively require a claimant to act within seven days or multiples thereof, was neither here nor there. HP had not identified any principled rationale for why the number “seven” holds any special significance in the context of the SOPA. It is the text of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that prevails and, as mentioned, MT’s Interpretation was neither absurd nor unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Case law and industry practice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 HP argued that its interpretation was supported by published cases and also industry practice, in particular: (a) a quick guide on the timelines under the SOPA published by the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore (“BCA Guide”), and (b) a checklist issued by the Singapore Mediation Centre as part of the adjudication application form to be submitted when claimants make their adjudication applications (“SMC Checklist”). The latter mentioned that the “7-days Dispute Settlement Period has ended and the AA is lodged within 7 days after the expiry of the Dispute Settlement Period”. It is obvious that the latter did not track the actual words used in s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA and had assumed that the seven days is computed from the end of the dispute settlement period. This is patently erroneous as the statutory language in s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) computes the seven days from the time “the entitlement of the claimant to make an adjudication application first arises under section 12”. Likewise, the BCA Guide (which is in the form of an infographic) made the same assumption. In any event, HP acknowledged that both do not have the force of law but argued that weight should be given to these documents. We did not agree that weight should be given to them in the light of the text of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA and s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In so far as HP relied on some cases to support its interpretation, HP acknowledged that the cases did not address squarely the interpretation of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Taisei Corp v Doo Ree Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2009] SGHC 156, the parties had adopted a computation which was the same as that based on HP’s Interpretation. In <span class="font-italic">Tienrui</span><span class="font-italic"> Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v G &amp; Y Trading and Manufacturing Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 852, the court had also adopted the same computation. However, there was no argument on s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA which was not in issue in either case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In so far as MT relied on <span class="font-italic">YTL Construction (S) Pte Ltd v Balanced Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 142 (“<span class="font-italic">YTL</span>”) to support its interpretation, the Judge noted (see<span class="font-italic"> H P Construction (GD)</span> at [10]), and we agreed, that the point was not argued there. In that case, the adjudication application was lodged approximately five weeks after the deadline for lodgement (<span class="font-italic">YTL </span>at [37]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 HP also relied on two cases to argue that MT was entitled to lodge an adjudication application at 0000 hours of 28 June 2023, which entitlement lasted till 2359 hours on 5 July 2023 (in view of a public holiday in between). They were <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span><span class="font-italic"> Interior Pte Ltd v Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 264 (“<span class="font-italic">Mansource</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>. However, this splitting of a day assumed that the computation started on 28 June 2023 which we did not agree with. In any event, the two cases did not deal with s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) SOPA and the facts there were quite different. The attempt to split a day was a desperate argument which flew in the face of the point made by the court at [26]–[28] and [56] of <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span>that there is a general principle of law that the law does not take into account fractions of a day. HP’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was also curious as the case lent better support to MT’s Interpretation. In <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span>, the court had, when interpreting s 15(1) of the SOPA, noted that there was no provision under the SOPA to explain the computation of time, and thus s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA would govern (<span class="font-italic">Mansource</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]–[14]). Logically, s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA should similarly apply to the interpretation of the timeline under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In summary, the disposal of the present appeal turned on the plain application of s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA to s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. There was no material before this court evincing a contrary intention that s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA should not be used to interpret s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. There was no necessity to refer to extraneous material to decide the meaning of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA – there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the statute after s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA is applied to the SOPA, and it cannot be said that MT’s Interpretation, which was adopted by the Judge as well, leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We were of the view that the present adjudication application was made within time on 6 July 2023 as the entitlement to lodge an adjudication application first arose on 28 June 2023, which was the day after the last day of the dispute settlement period, and an adjudication application should be filed within seven days <span class="font-italic">after</span> 28 June 2023, which would be 6 July 2023 (excluding the public holiday on 29 June 2023). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at $30,400 inclusive of disbursements.

On 28 June 2023, MT was entitled to lodge an adjudication application: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[22]</span>. MT’s case was that 28 June 2023 was excluded from the computation of the seven-day period for calculating the deadline for lodging the adjudication application (“MT’s Interpretation”).

Moreover, there is a general principle of law that the law does not take into account fractions of a day, and thus, in calculating the deadline for making an adjudication application under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, the deadline calculation excludes the entirety of the day when the subject event happens, ie, the date when the entitlement to make the adjudication application under s 12 of the SOPA first arises: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 There was no need to rely on extraneous material not forming part of the written law in the interpretation of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA or s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA in the present context as HP did not argue that any part of the SOPA or the IA was ambiguous or obscure and neither did it suggest that MT’s Interpretation was manifestly absurd or unreasonable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[33]</span>.
