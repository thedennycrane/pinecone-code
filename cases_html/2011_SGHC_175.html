        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, a judgment creditor of the
                    defendant, failed to effect service of bankruptcy process on the latter. The
                    process of service began on 11 January 2011 when the plaintiff served
                    the bankruptcy papers at the defendant’s last known residence at
                    82 Jalan Angin Laut. The defendant’s brother said to the process
                    server that the defendant was not in. Another attempt was made on
                    16 January 2011. This time the defendant’s brother said that the
                    defendant no longer lived there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Thus, on 18 January 2011, the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors applied for substituted service by advertising in
                    the Straits Times and exhibiting a sealed copy of the order of court on the
                    Notice Board of the High Court. On the previous day, the defendant’s
                    brother, Michael Tan, sent a letter to inform the plaintiff’s solicitors
                    that the defendant now works in China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 19 January 2011 the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors were directed to effect substituted service by post instead of
                    advertisement. This order was affirmed on 24 January 2011 when Michael
                    Tan’s letter was brought to the court’s attention. On
                    31 January 2011 the court order that substituted service be effected by
                    posting the bankruptcy papers on the front door of the defendant’s address
                    at 82 Jalan Angin Laut was extracted and service was effected accordingly
                    on 2 February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 30 May 2011 the defendant applied to set
                    aside the service of process. This application was dismissed by AR Nathaniel
                    Khng (“AR Khng”). The defendant appealed before me to set aside AR
                    Khng’s dismissal of his application and that the bankruptcy application be
                    set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Ng Lip Chih (“Mr Ng”), counsel
                    for the defendant submitted that the house at Jalan Angin Laut belonged to
                    Michael Tan and the plaintiff knew that the defendant was now living in China,
                    and that the order by AR Khng was wrong for thinking that substituted service at
                    82 Jalan Angin Laut was the proper order to make. Mr Ng argued that the
                    plaintiff had not taken reasonable steps to determine whether the defendant was
                    in fact living in China, and had instead proceeded in the belief that the
                    defendant was still residing in Singapore. Mr Ng relied on rule 111 of the
                    Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“rule 111”) which
                    provides as follows–</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If the court is satisfied by affidavit or other
                            evidence on oath that prompt personal service cannot be effected because
                            the debtor is keeping out of the way to avoid service of a
                            creditor’s bankruptcy application, or for any other cause, the
                            court may order substituted service to be effected in such manner as it
                            thinks fit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If the debtor is not in Singapore, the court may
                            order service to be made within such time and in such manner and form as
                            it thinks fit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(3)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Where an order for substituted service has been
                            carried out, the bankruptcy application shall be deemed to have been
                            duly served on the debtor</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Ng relied on the authority of <em>Re Peh Kong Wan, ex p United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd</em>
                    [1992] 2 MLJ 292 (“<em>Re Peh Kong Wan</em>”)
                    in which VC George J commented that it was pointless to have ordered
                    that there be a posting of the legal process on the front door of a
                    debtor’s home if it was known that the debtor no longer lived there.
                        <em>Re Peh Kong Wan</em> was not laying down any
                    general rule that would detract from the court’s powers under rule 111. In
                        <em>Re Peh Kong Wan</em>’s case, the judgment
                    creditor attempted to enforce its judgment debt almost 12 years after it
                    obtained judgment. An order for substituted service was granted but on appeal,
                    VC George J cautioned against such an order when no reasons were given as to
                    what basis the judgment creditor had for supposing that the debtor was still in
                    Malaysia when the evidence showed that he was likely to be in
                Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I agree with VC George J that bankruptcy imposes
                    a change of status with severe consequences on the bankrupt and that the courts
                    must be strict in ensuring that the procedural steps are complied with. Rule 111
                    (2) provides the court with very broad discretionary powers in respect of the
                    service of process on a debtor who is not in Singapore. In this present case, it
                    appears that the defendant may not be in Singapore. This meant that the caution
                    expressed by VC George J must constantly be held in mind, but just because
                    a debtor is known to be out of jurisdiction does not mean an order for
                    substituted service in Singapore cannot be effected. The difference between
                        <em>Re Peh Kong Wan</em> and this case is
                    threefold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       First, in this case, there was sufficient
                    evidence that justified a conclusion that the defendant was evading service.
                    There was evidence that he attempted to convince the plaintiff that he was in
                    Brazil, and then, subsequently, in China. Secondly, there was evidence before
                    AR Khng that indicated that the defendant was still in touch with his
                    brother Michael Tan who lives in 82 Jalan Angin Laut. AR Khng was
                    justified in dismissing the defendant’s application because anyone would
                    reasonably have concluded that in the circumstances of this case a bankruptcy
                    notice against the defendant posted on the door of the 82 Jalan Angin Laut
                    house would have been swiftly brought to the defendant’s attention.
                    Thirdly, the plaintiff sought to enforce his judgment debt
                expeditiously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant’s appeal is therefore
                    dismissed.</p>
