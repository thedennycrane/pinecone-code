        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Nirmal Singh s/o
                    Fauja Singh (“the applicant”) to have his name restored onto the
                    roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore (“the
                    Roll”) pursuant to s 102(1) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). The applicant was 56
                    years old and this application was his second since he was struck off the Roll
                    in 1995. We allowed his application and we now give our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts leading up to striking off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applicant joined the Singapore Police Force
                    (“SPF”) in 1977 and served as an officer for more than 11 years.
                    While serving as a Police Officer, he made profitable use of his spare time to
                    read for an external law degree from the University of London. Through
                    determination and hard work, he obtained his degree in 1982. Eventually, he was
                    called to the English Bar. He left the SPF in 1989 and was admitted as an
                    advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 8 November
                    1989. He began his career as a legal assistant in the firm of Amarjit, Rubin
                    &amp; Partners. He then joined Assomull, Pereira &amp; Partners, before moving
                    to the firm of Gurdaib, Cheong &amp; Narmal where he became a partner in July
                    1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 3 September 1993, the applicant was
                    convicted of three charges of corruption under the Prevention of Corruption Act
                    (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”) and one charge of
                    criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) under the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). The applicant was found to have corruptly
                    offered gratification of $3,000 to a police officer as an inducement for letting
                    his client off from police investigations into several housebreaking offences.
                    In the process, the court also found that the applicant corruptly solicited and
                    received gratification of $3,000 from his client for his assistance. These three
                    acts formed the basis of the three corruption convictions. As for the CBT
                    charge, the court found that the applicant misappropriated an amount of $500
                    belonging to his firm, Assomull, Pereira &amp; Partners. In total, the applicant
                    was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment and fined a sum of $5,000. He
                    paid the fine, served the term of imprisonment, and was released, with the
                    appropriate remission for good conduct, on 19 October 1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After the applicant’s release, a
                    Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law
                    Society”) was appointed to investigate the applicant’s conduct
                    pertaining to his criminal convictions. The applicant admitted to the
                    professional misconduct charges, and the Disciplinary Committee found that
                    sufficient cause existed for disciplinary action to be taken against him. The
                    Law Society thereafter applied for an order requiring the applicant to show
                    cause why he should not be dealt with under s 83(1) of the LPA. At the
                    conclusion of the show cause proceedings on 1 December 1995, the court of
                    three judges ordered the applicant be struck off the Roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 3 April 2001, and after a lapse of about
                    5 years, the applicant filed his first application for reinstatement. Upon
                    consideration of all the facts up until the application, the court of three
                    judges dismissed that application. The court found the application premature and
                    that it was not satisfied that the applicant could have been fully reformed and
                    rehabilitated in that relatively short time period since his striking off.
                    Moreover, it was not satisfied that the public would be adequately protected if
                    the applicant was allowed back into legal practice at that point of time. The
                    full decision of the court can be found at <em>Re Nirmal Singh
                        s/o Fauja Singh</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Nirmal Singh 1”</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applicant’s conduct subsequent to striking off and up to the
                making of the present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After the applicant was struck off the Roll, he
                    had been gainfully employed as a human resource and legal manager in three
                    different companies: Sin Seng Huat International Group of Companies
                    (2 January 1996 to 30 June 2004), Midwest Group of Companies
                    (1 October 2004 – 5 May 2006), and Wei Yang Cosmetics
                    International Pte Ltd &amp; Antibac Laboratories Pte Ltd (30 May 2006
                    – Present). The applicant deposed that he was upfront with his three
                    employers about his past, disclosing to all of them his convictions as well as
                    the fact that he has been struck off the Roll. In the course of his employment
                    with them, they gave the applicant substantial administrative and financial
                    responsibilities, including the handling of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Other than being gainfully employed, the
                    applicant also deposed that he sought spiritual help, and in doing so,
                    volunteered his time to his religious organisations. Since 1996, the applicant
                    regularly attended his Sikh temple, and as part of his own rehabilitation
                    efforts, volunteered to serve and cook food and wash dishes for his
                    congregation. Additionally, since 2001, he had also been involved in the monthly
                    counting of donations offered by the devotees who pray at the temple. From 2003
                    onwards, the applicant served as a volunteer with the Sikh Welfare Council,
                    which runs various community and humanitarian projects. One of these projects
                    was the counselling of Sikh prisoners, to which the applicant devoted his time
                    every Saturday since 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Even though the applicant had been struck of the
                    Rolls, it was evident that he still kept in touch with the law. Between 2000 and
                    2002, the applicant furthered his education and obtained a Master of laws from
                    the University of London.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Since the applicant was struck off the Roll on
                    1 December 1995, he did not have any further major brushes with the law.
                    However, in accordance with paragraph 7 of the Law Society of Singapore
                    Council’s Guidance Note 2 of 2009, the applicant disclosed that he was
                    issued with two notices for regulatory offences. One notice was from the Land
                    Transport Authority for the offence of driving in a bus lane during restricted
                    hours, and another notice was from the Housing Development Board for a parking
                    offence. In both cases, the applicant deposed that the notices were later
                    rescinded after he wrote to the respective authorities to explain the
                    circumstances leading up to those offences. The applicant further disclosed that
                    he was a respondent in an ongoing civil matter in Punjab where the subject
                    matter of the dispute concerned the distribution of ancestral property that
                    belonged to his late father.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This court’s power to reinstate an
                    advocate and solicitor back onto the Roll is governed by s 102 of the LPA.
                    It provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Replacement on roll of solicitor who has
                            been struck off 102</b>. —(1) Where the name of a
                        solicitor has been removed from, or struck off, the roll, the court may, if
                        it thinks fit, at any time order the Registrar to replace on the roll the
                        name of the solicitor —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    free from conditions; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    subject to such conditions as the court thinks
                                fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any application
                            that the name of a solicitor be replaced on the roll shall be made by
                            originating summons, supported by affidavit, before a court of 3 Judges
                            of the Supreme Court of whom the Chief Justice shall be
                        one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The originating summons
                            shall be served on the Society which shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    appear at the
                                hearing of the application;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    place before the
                                court a report which shall include —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    copies of the record of any proceedings as
                                    the result of which the name of the solicitor was removed from
                                    or struck off the roll; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   a statement of any facts which have
                                    occurred since the name of the solicitor was removed from or
                                    struck off the roll and which, in the opinion of the Council or
                                    any member of the Council, are relevant to be considered or
                                    investigated in connection with the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The decision whether to allow an application
                    for reinstatement to the Roll is a matter entirely within the court’s
                    discretion. The considerations which are germane to such an application were
                    examined in these recent cases, namely, <em>Re Chan Chow
                        Wang</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 55, <em>Re Lim
                        Cheng Peng</em> [1987] SLR(R) 582, <em>Re Ram
                        Kishan</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 260, <em>Knight
                        Glenn Jeyasingam v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 704 (“<em>Glenn
                    Knight</em>”), <em>Narindar Singh Kang v Law Society
                        of Singapore</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 641 (“<em>Narindar</em>”), <em>Gnaguru s/o
                        Thamboo Mylvaganam v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 1 and <em>Kalpanath Singh s/o Ram Raj Singh v
                        Law Society of Singapore</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1018
                        (“<em>Kalpanath</em>”). The following
                    broad principles may be extracted therefrom:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The order for restoration is discretionary and is
                            to be exercised judicially;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The outcome of each application must necessarily
                            depend on the precise circumstances of the case itself; precedents are
                            useful only for the principles they enunciate but not in relation to the
                            outcome;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The applicant bears the onus of convincing the
                            court that he has been fully rehabilitated and is now a fit person to be
                            restored to the roll and that he is a person on whose integrity and
                            honour reliance may be placed by the public;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    The court’s primary duty in the
                            consideration of the application is in ensuring the protection of the
                            public and the public confidence in the general reputation of the legal
                            profession</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    The court is not bound by the observations of the
                            Attorney-General and/or the Law Society but their views would be given
                            due weight and consideration as the Attorney General is charged with the
                            duty of safeguarding the public interest and the Law Society is one of
                            the guardians of the legal profession;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    The application for restoration is subjected to
                            stricter scrutiny than an application by a new entrant to the
                            profession;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    There is no fixed time frame for restoration but a
                            significantly longer period than five years after striking off should
                            elapse before an applicant applies for reinstatement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    An applicant will not generally be prevented from
                            being reinstated unless in the most exceptional or egregious
                            circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In support of this application, counsel for
                    the applicant Mr Davinder Singh, S.C. made three main submissions. First, he
                    submitted that an adequate period of time had lapsed between the time the
                    applicant was struck off the Roll and the making of this second application.
                    Secondly, he argued that in the course of the last 14 years, the applicant had
                    been completely repentant and had awoken to the importance of honour and
                    principle in relation to the profession. Thirdly, that the reinstatement of the
                    applicant to the Roll would neither endanger the public nor diminish public
                    confidence in the general reputation and standing of the legal profession. In
                    reply, counsel representing the Law Society Mr N Sreenivasan, and
                    State Counsel Ms Ching Sann representing the Attorney-General, submitted
                    that there were no objections against the application provided that conditions
                    were imposed onto his practising certificate restricting, <em>inter alia</em>, his capacity to hold client monies and practising as
                    a sole proprietor for a pre-determined period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Applying the principles set out in <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, and having considered all the
                    circumstances of the case, including the arguments advanced by counsel for the
                    applicant as well as the positions taken by the Attorney General and the Law
                    Society, we were satisfied that this was an appropriate case to exercise our
                    discretion in favour of the applicant. We will now elaborate on the basis of our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Rehabilitation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the words of the court in <em>Kalpanath</em> (at [19]), the threshold factor which the
                    court must carefully consider in every application for reinstatement is
                    “the extent to which the applicant has rehabilitated himself. Nothing
                    short of full rehabilitation will do”. Therefore, first, we needed to be
                    satisfied that the applicant was fully rehabilitated and was no longer a danger
                    or risk to the public if he were to be reinstated onto the Roll. The applicant
                    was charged and convicted of two types of offences (corruption and criminal
                    breaches of trust), both of which involved dishonesty. It was therefore vitally
                    important to the court that he had realised the error of his past ways and
                    demonstrated by positive acts or conduct that he was not likely to repeat
                    similar wrongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this respect, we noted that when the
                    applicant secured his subsequent employment after being struck off the Roll (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) he was upfront with his
                    employers as to his past wrongdoings. Notwithstanding this disclosure, the
                    employers believed in him, took him on and even entrusted him with financial
                    responsibilities involving the handling of money. He did not disappoint them. He
                    lived up to the high standard expected of him and exhibited qualities of honesty
                    and integrity. These qualities have been extolled in testimonials written by the
                    directors of the companies who employed him. The Managing Director of the Sin
                    Seng Huat International Group of Companies, where the applicant was employed for
                    a continuous period of eight year after being struck off (and which period also
                    straddled the time when the applicant first applied for restoration onto the
                    Roll), recited how the applicant was entrusted with large sums of money, how the
                    applicant honestly accounted for all monies received from the rentals of the
                    company’s property in Australia, and how the applicant never breached any
                    trust reposed in him when he was empowered by the company’s board of
                    directors to deal with their bankers. Equally notable was the fact that after
                    the applicant left the employ of this company, the applicant continued to be
                    entrusted with comparable financial responsibilities and powers in the two
                    companies he was subsequently employed in until the date of this application. We
                    were impressed with what the third employer wrote about him and here we need
                    only quote one paragraph of the employer’s letter:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the course of my dealing [<em>sic</em>] with
                        Nirmal, I find him to be a humble, responsible and an honest person who
                        discharges his duties honestly. He is a trustworthy person and has not
                        breach [<em>sic</em>] the trust which the Company and I
                        have placed in him. In the course of his duties, Nirmal has received money
                        and made payments on behalf of the Company and in all these instances he has
                        acted honestly and with propriety. He has been honest even to the point of
                        pointing out discrepancies in payments made by the Company to third parties
                        when he could have ignored them resulting in financial loss to the
                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The testimonials given by all his employers
                    were unanimous in their praise for the applicant and all of them vouched for the
                    applicant’s honesty, responsibility, reliability, trustworthiness and
                    integrity. It stands to reason and common sense, that in circumstances such as
                    the present case, one of the best ways to gauge whether a person who had
                    previously done wrong has reformed is to see how he has conducted himself
                    post-striking off, particularly in employment where he was entrusted with
                    responsibilities, financial or otherwise. Testimonials of such employers should
                    thus carry weight since they would have worked in close proximity with the
                    applicant and observed his conduct, including his general attitude (such as
                    whether he is someone who has the tendency to sail close to the wind). In this
                    case, we had no doubt that the employers, having known of his background, would
                    understandably be cautious about the applicant’s handling of financial
                    responsibilities. The fact that he had managed to gain the confidence of the
                    management of all three companies, which not only did not have any complaint
                    against him but spoke highly of him as an employee, bore testament to his
                    rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We should also add that besides the character
                    references of his employers, the applicant had also obtained testimonials from
                    seven senior members of the Bar, all of whom are of more than twenty years
                    standing and who knew him well. From 2003, he became involved in community work,
                    being a volunteer with the Sikh Welfare Council where he took part, <em>inter alia</em>, in fund raising and visiting the sick and
                    infirm in hospitals. From 2005, he became a volunteer counsellor with the
                    Singapore Prison Service and devoted his Saturdays to counselling Sikh prisoners
                    to help them mend their ways and, in so doing, atone for his own past
                    transgressions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the premises, we were satisfied that the
                    applicant had reformed and was unlikely to pose a danger or a risk to the public
                    if he were to be again accorded a position of trust upon reinstatement onto the
                    Roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Confidence in the profession and public interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We also found that the applicant’s
                    reinstatement would not diminish public confidence in the reputation and
                    standing of the legal profession. In a sense, this point raises the issue as to
                    how society should view wrongdoings by a professional who holds a position of
                    trust. Is it correct to say that just because an advocate and solicitor has done
                    wrong involving dishonesty, he should be damned forever and never again to be
                    allowed to practise as such? Will that be just?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In this regard, we noted that a major campaign
                    which has been undertaken for a few years now is the Yellow Ribbon project which
                    aims to give offenders a second chance in society with a call to employers not
                    to shun such persons. Of course, we recognise that there is a difference between
                    wrongdoing by an ordinary individual and a professional like an advocate and
                    solicitor in whom trust is reposed by clients. On the other hand, even for
                    wrongdoings involving dishonesty there are varying degrees of severity or
                    gravity, and in turn culpability. All such wrongdoings could well lead to
                    disbarment. As noted by this court in <em>Narindar</em> (at
                    [42]), “...there are certain offences which are less serious but which
                    nevertheless meet the threshold requirement that will result in the advocate and
                    solicitor concerned being struck off the roll”. While this court takes a
                    serious view of any wrongdoing involving dishonesty by advocates and solicitors,
                    we are also mindful that even as between wrongdoings involving dishonesty there
                    will be differences as to seriousness. Consequently, there is a need to maintain
                    a sense of proportionality and fairness. Moreover, it would also be in the
                    interest of society to promote redemption: see <em>Kalpanath</em> (at [23]). Except in the most egregious of offences,
                    and we did not think that the wrongdoings of the applicant here fell within that
                    category, this court would not rule out reinstatement of an advocate and
                    solicitor who have been struck off. What was clear from precedents was that the
                    greater the severity of the offences committed, the longer would be the
                    intervening period before this court would consider reinstatement. As observed
                    by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Glenn Knight</em> (at
                    [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Each case must be decided on its own facts. One of the most important
                        considerations must be the nature of the transgression that had resulted in
                        his disbarment in the first place. The transgression, in terms of its
                        criminality and its gravity, will invariably feature prominently in the
                        court’s assessment of the adequacy of the period of time that has
                        lapsed since the applicant has ceased practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar position was also taken, and further explained in the case
                    of <em>Narindar</em> (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Indeed, the natural public expectation would be that an
                            advocate and solicitor who has committed a particularly serious offence
                            would have to wait a longer period to be restored to the roll compared
                            to one who had committed a less serious offence, regardless of whether
                            or not the same (or a similar) offence was likely to be committed in the
                            future</em>. We would go so far as to say that this would be an
                        expectation held by all concerned (including those within the legal
                        profession itself) <em>simply because it accords with logic,
                            common sense and justice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Accordingly, what would constitute an adequate
                    intervening period must be ascertained with regard to the severity of the
                    offences that led to the applicant being struck off. The applicant’s
                    counsel seemed to suggest during oral submissions before us that the seriousness
                    of the applicant’s offences was mitigated by the fact that those offences
                    were committed by the applicant during the relative infancy of his legal
                    practice. We could not see any merit to this argument. While it is true that the
                    offences were committed a few months after the applicant was admitted to the Bar
                    on 8 November 1989, by the time the applicant left the SPF in 1989, he had
                    served more than 11 years in law enforcement. The applicant was no babe in the
                    woods and he must have known full well what he was doing, and the consequences
                    that would follow when he solicited, accepted and offered a bribe to a police
                    officer. In view of the applicant’s background and the nature of the
                    offences committed, we had no hesitation in rejecting the argument that the
                    offences were committed due to his lack of professional experience. Indeed, one
                    does not need to be a lawyer to know that what the applicant did was wrong. We
                    would hasten to add that while we were not with him on this point, we were in no
                    way suggesting that his offence was so severe and the circumstances so
                    despicable that he should be barred for good. We were of the overall view that,
                    in the circumstances of this case, 14 years was a sufficiently long intervening
                    period of time to enable the court to determine if the applicant had truly
                    reformed and turned over a new leaf or if any public concern would arise if he
                    were to be restored to the Roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The matter that caused us to ponder a little
                    more in our consideration of this case related to the question of public
                    interest. Would it be perceived that this court had too readily condoned the
                    offences committed by the applicant some 20 years ago? By any standard, twenty
                    years (or even fourteen years if we reckon as from the date of striking off)
                    cannot be said to be an insignificant period in the life of an individual. The
                    applicant here has paid for the wrongs he had done under both ordinary criminal
                    law and the disciplinary rules of the profession. Punishment should not be the
                    sole value of society. Redemption should also have a part to play. A balance has
                    to be struck. In <em>Kalpanath</em>, this court adopted a
                    broader definition of public interest, one that encourages redemption. There,
                    this court stated (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We believe that one... common value [our society may adopt] is forgiving
                        those who have trespassed against us. We would also concur with Kirby P that
                        there is a public interest in encouraging the rehabilitation of those who
                        have gone astray and allowing those who are now reformed, to re-enter
                        society and contribute to its well-being. Further, we would agree, as
                        counsel for the Applicant urged this Court during the hearing, that the
                        Court has, <em>inter alia</em>, a redemptive role
                        especially in an application for reinstatement to the Roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In every case of reinstatement, the court has
                    to resolve the tension between the protective and redemptive elements of public
                    interest. While the redemptive element is essential, and must be considered in
                    all cases, the weight to be given to this element must differ from case to case.
                    For example, the longer the period of disbarment, or the lesser the severity of
                    the offences committed, the greater will be the weight the redemption element
                    will be accorded in the mind of this court. In this application, as a
                    substantial period of time had lapsed since the applicant’s striking off
                    and since he has shown remarkable rehabilitation, there was correspondingly a
                    lesser need for this court to exercise its protective role. In turn, it would be
                    consistent for this court to exercise its redemptive role. All things
                    considered, we were satisfied that the applicant had been fully rehabilitated
                    and was fit to be reinstated onto the Roll.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conditions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We now turn to the conditions which the Law
                    Society proposed to be imposed on the applicant’s practising certificate
                    if this court was inclined to reinstate the applicant onto the Roll, and which
                    proposal was supported by the Attorney-General. In the light of certain comments
                    which this court made in the course of the oral hearing, and which both the Law
                    Society and the Attorney-General accepted, the eventual conditions imposed on
                    the applicant were as follows:</p>

                            least 10 hours of ethics training conducted by the Law Society of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It seemed to us that these conditions were
                    proposed out of abundance of caution and were intended to serve dual purposes.
                    First, they were to remove any lingering doubts which the public might entertain
                    as to the honesty or integrity of the applicant. Second, bearing in mind that
                    the applicant had been out of touch with practice for a long period of time,
                    some of the conditions would facilitate his return to the profession in a manner
                    which would enable him to competently discharge his services to his clients,
                        <em>e.g</em>., supervision for two years. We were
                    satisfied that these conditions were useful and we endorsed them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     To recap, in relation to his first application
                    for reinstatement, the court was of the view that the offences committed by the
                    applicant were grave and there was then an insufficient intervening period to
                    assess whether he was fully rehabilitated. That application was considered
                    premature. In the present application, while we again acknowledged the gravity
                    of the offences, a more substantial period of time had elapsed and also more
                    material was presented to this court that enabled us to make a better assessment
                    of his rehabilitation. Having considered how the applicant had conducted himself
                    in the last 14 years, we were satisfied that the applicant had adequately
                    demonstrated his full rehabilitation, and we were also satisfied that it would
                    not be against public interest to reinstate him onto the Roll. Accordingly, we
                    allowed his application and made no order as to costs.</p>
