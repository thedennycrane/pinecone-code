Yet the allegation was not put to Sgt Yogaraj. Instead, various other possible explanations were suggested to Sgt Yogaraj for the Accused’s admission that he knew the “books” were drugs. In particular, it was suggested that the Accused might only have realised, and admitted to knowing that the “books” were drugs: from being arrested by the CNB, being shown the bundles, and being read the MDP Notification (which in Tamil mentioned “bothai porul” – illegal drugs).

The Accused could not explain why he had not mentioned this, other than to say that it did not occur to him at that moment because he was in a state of panic.

He said he did not inform the investigator about the loan from “Siva” as it was his “personal thing”. This explanation makes no sense – the Accused had shared with the investigator various personal matters about his family, and he could not explain why the supposed loan from “Siva” was even more personal, such that he would decline to mention it, and instead lie about receiving payments into his Maybank account.

They suggest that he knew he could get into more serious trouble, than if he were merely delivering wrongful reading books. Moreover, he had not – when expressing his concerns about carrying out the deliveries – said in his statements that he thought he was delivering wrongful reading books.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is unlikely that the Accused would simply have accepted that the bundles were “books” as “Siva” had allegedly told him.

</div> The statements do not, however, bear out this alleged confusion: in his eighth long statement, the Accused had described in some detail which of the “things” he had touched, why he had touched them, and the manner in which he had touched them. In particular, the Accused had explained that he had touched the “things” because he had to count them, and added that he had even pulled one of the “things” a bit forward and then pushed it back, specifically identifying the one of the three bundles that was in the white plastic bag (see [53] above). Moreover, he maintained this on a separate occasion when his tenth long statement was recorded, further confirming that the version of events stated in the second long statement was incorrect (see [54] above). Notably, he did not say at any time in the statement recording process that he was confused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On a related note, in his second long statement, the Accused described the “things” in some detail (see the extract quoted at [52] above), and that is inconsistent with his claim at trial that he had simply looked into the bag, with the light off. This suggests that even if the light was off, he was still able to see what he had described in his statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, I find that the Accused had touched the bundles, as he had admitted in his eighth and tenth long statements. His having checked and touched the bundles is consistent with his ability to describe them as looking like packets (see [32(c)]–[33] above), with other details besides (see [52] above). This goes against his main defence that he thought they were wrongful reading books.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Accused seemed to be distancing himself from the contents of the bag, so as to deny knowledge of what they were. When confronted about why he thought the “things” in the bag were “books” despite not having touched them, he started by saying “what was told to me [was] that it was books and it looked like books to me”. He was then asked how he could say they looked like reading books if the cab was dark, and his responses were: “Because Siva told me that it was books.” and “What was informed to me, that it was books. That’s all.”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 What the Accused did know, is that he was doing something illegal on behalf of “Siva” (save that he claimed he believed that he was just carrying wrongful reading books); that he was scared because he needed to pass through customs and bring the “thing” into Singapore; that Siva had said the job was a dangerous one; and that he chose to do the job despite being scared because he wanted the money (see [44]–[45] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Any relationship between the Accused and “Siva” was essentially transactional and superficial in nature, like that in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shalleh</span> (see [35]). As such, it is implausible that the Accused would simply have believed what “Siva” had told him – that the bundles were books – despite having personally checked and touched the bundles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Moreover, as in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shalleh</span>, the fact that the Accused had himself seen, checked, and touched the bundles (as I found at [51] and [57] above) is highly relevant. In that case, the bundles were roughly palm-sized, rounded packages which the accused person could not have thought to contain two and a half cartons of cigarettes (which is what he said he was told they contained). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision that the appearance of the bundles must have caused the accused person to know that they contained something else, and whatever he had been told about them containing cartons of cigarettes was therefore manifestly unreliable: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shalleh</span> at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the present case, the Accused admitted that he had checked the bundles, and that he saw that “they [were] not like reading books, they look[ed] like packets” (see [32(c)]–[33] above). Thus, even if the Accused had understood from Siva’s use of the term “buku” that he was carrying reading books, he would have known they were <span class="font-italic">not</span> reading books after having seen what they looked like.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I thus find that the Accused has not rebutted the presumption by stating simply that he believed the bundles were books because Siva had said they were books.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Accused’s main defence that he thought the bundles were “reading books”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In view of the above, I do not accept the Accused’s testimony that he thought the bundles were “reading books”. His main defence on the element of knowledge thus fails. I go on to consider his alternative defence on this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Accused’s alternative defence: even if the Accused believed he was carrying an illegal drug, he did not know which drug it was</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Accused’s alternative defence (that he did not know <span class="font-italic">which</span> illegal drug he was carrying) was not mentioned in his testimony, and understandably so: it is inconsistent with his main defence of believing that the bundles were “reading books”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The alternative defence was put forward only in oral reply submissions, after the exchange of written closing submissions. The contention is: even if the Accused did not genuinely believe the bundles were “reading books”, and instead he knew the bundles were drugs (as he had said in the Contemporaneous Statement – see [16]–[19] above), the presumption of knowledge is nevertheless rebutted for the Accused did not know if the drug he was carrying was cannabis or some other drug.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [59], the court noted that the cases in which the presumption of knowledge has successfully been rebutted can broadly be divided into two categories:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, where the accused person is able to prove that he believed he was carrying something <span class="font-italic">innocuous,</span> even if he is unable to specify exactly what that was. Such a belief, by definition, excludes a belief that he was in possession of a controlled drug, let alone the specific drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, where the accused person is able to prove that he believed he was in possession of <span class="font-italic">some contraband item or drug other than</span> the specific drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Accused’s alternative defence would not fall in either category:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It would not fall in the first category, for the Accused would not be thinking he was carrying something innocuous. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It would not fall in the second category – the contention is not that the Accused thought the drug he was carrying was <span class="font-italic">not</span> cannabis; rather, it is that the Accused thought he was carrying a drug, which might be cannabis, but he did not know if it was cannabis or some other drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 If the Accused believed he was in possession of an illegal drug that might be cannabis, but simply asserts that he did not know what type of drug it was, that does not rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew the drug was cannabis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The court in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> noted at [57(a)] that an accused person who seeks to rebut the presumption of knowledge “should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, and a claim that he simply did not know what he was carrying would not usually suffice”. Nor will it suffice for the accused person simply to claim that he did not know what he was carrying <span class="font-italic">save that he did not think it was drugs</span>: <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> at [33], <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span> at [39]. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>put it, if such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption of knowledge, the presumption would be “all bark and no bite”. The Accused cannot be in a better position by claiming that even if he knew he was carrying illegal drugs, he did not know <span class="font-italic">which</span> illegal drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Defence’s contention is not that the Accused thought he was carrying something other than cannabis, it is that he simply did not know which illegal drug it was. This is not a case like <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 201, or <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Phuthita Somchit and another</span> [2011] 3 SLR 719 where the court accepted that the accused persons knew they were in possession of drugs, but believed that they were drugs <span class="font-italic">other than diamorphine</span> (which is what the drugs in those cases actually were).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Defence’s contention simply means the Accused was indifferent as to which illegal drug he was transporting. As the Accused said in his third long statement (quoted at [44] above), he did not even ask “Siva” what he was delivering: “I did not bother much and did not ask him anything because all I wanted was the money from him.” His ninth long statement recorded on 28 March 2019 is in similar vein.

</div> However, the court in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shalleh </span>did not say that such a claim would have rebutted the presumption of knowledge; the court was simply saying that that was not the accused person’s case.

If the Accused meant to say that is what “Siva” told him, but it was <span class="font-italic">not</span> his intention to do what “Siva” told him, he should have said so, rather than simply saying “yes”. Moreover, the Defence did not seek to clarify this aspect of his evidence in re-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Further, the first part of the question – that “Siva” told him to wait and to finish the job – was quite uncontroversial. That is what the Accused had already said in his first long statement: ““Siva” told me to just wait a while, just wait a while, let’s just finish this job.” (quoted at [85] above). It would therefore have been clear to the Accused that the thrust of the question was its second part – whether it was the Accused’s intention to do what “Siva” had told him to do – and the Accused agreed with that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 This is reinforced by the cross-examination immediately preceding that question, where the Accused confirmed that he would follow whatever “Siva” told him, and in particular that he would pass all the three “books” to the person coming to collect them.

When he was arrested, he was still waiting at the place where he was expecting someone to come for the bundles. As recounted in his first long statement (see [85] above), the Accused had said to “Siva” that he wanted to leave and not keep waiting, but he had not left; “Siva” had asked him to wait for a while longer and finish the job, and his testimony was that he had intended to follow “Siva’s” instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Furthermore, even if the Accused had intended to leave the place where he had been waiting, it does not follow that he had ceased to have the intention to traffic in the bundles.

He did not say that he intended to go back to Malaysia with the bundles and return them to “Siva”. He might simply have intended to go to another location in Singapore pending further instructions from “Siva” as to the delivery of the bundles.
