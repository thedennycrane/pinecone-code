The claimant had served the originating process in OC 295 on the defendant, a Hong Kong-incorporated company, by way of registered post and without having obtained the court’s approval for service out of jurisdiction under O 8 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021. The claimant had done so on the basis that a written contract, which it claimed was the operative agreement between the parties, permitted for service out of Singapore and so, in accordance with O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021, the court’s approval was not required. The defendant disputed that the written contract was the operative agreement between the parties, and that in any event, it did not permit for service out of Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 There were two issues of interest raised in SUM 2812. First, what are the requirements of a contract allowing for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021? The claimant’s case in SUM 2812 was that a clause in the written contract, which provided for the Singapore courts to have jurisdiction over disputes arising therefrom and “service of process by registered mail”, gave rise to such a contract coming within O 8 r 1(3). Secondly, in the determination of whether a default judgment was regular or irregular, is the court limited only to those materials and grounds that the claimant had relied on in obtaining the default judgment? This issue arose because the defendant’s primary position in SUM 2812 was that the operative agreement between the parties is found in some other contract (and not the written contract) that contained no provision whatsoever on service of originating process. The claimant however did not rely on this other contract in obtaining JUD 252 and it also denied that this other contract was the operative agreement between the parties. Could this other contract even be relevant to the determination of whether JUD 252 was a regular or an irregular default judgment? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the event, I allowed the setting-aside application in SUM 2812. These grounds set out my reasons for doing so, as well as my views on the two issues identified above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The claimant, NW Corporation Pte Ltd (“NWC”), is a Singapore-incorporated company. The defendant, HK Petroleum Enterprises Cooperation Limited (“HKE”), is a Hong Kong-incorporated company. Both NWC and HKE are in the business of trading of chemical products and commodities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The claims in OC 295 arose out of two transactions that NWC and HKE had entered into: (a) a transaction for the sale of light Naphtha crude (“the Naptha Transaction”); and (b) a transaction for the sale of Gasoil (“the Gasoil Transaction”) (collectively, “the Transactions”). In SUM 2812, HKE did not dispute that it had entered into the Transactions, but it disputed the terms applicable to the Transactions and whether it had, as NWC alleged, acted in breach of the relevant agreement to which each of the Transactions relate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">NWC’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 NWC’s case is that on or about 27 December 2022, it entered into an agreement with HKE in connection with the Naptha Transaction (“the Naptha Agreement”). The terms of the Naptha Agreement were first set out in a term sheet and subsequently set out in a formal written contract dated 3 March 2023 (“the Written Contract”). NWC pleaded in its Statement of Claim (“the SOC”) that it had prepared the Written Contract and sent it by e-mail to HKE, but HKE did not sign and return a copy of the Written Contract to NWC. Nonetheless, NWC’s position was that HKE had, by virtue of its subsequent conduct, accepted the terms of the Written Contract as the terms of the Naptha Agreement.

This variation, however, was not accepted by Emirates National Petroleum Company (“ENPC”), the seller from which HKE was to purchase the light Naptha crude in fulfilment of the Naptha Agreement, and HKE therefore could not agree to the variation.

The principle underlying this discretionary power is that, unless and until the court has pronounced a judgment upon the merits or by consent of the parties, it is to have the power to revoke the expression of its coercive power where that has been only obtained by a failure to follow any of the rules of procedure (see <span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam </span>[1937] AC 473 at 480, cited in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Quee Choo (suing as co-administratrix of the estate of Koh Jit Meng) and another v David Rasif and another </span>[2008] SGHC 36 at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> (at [43]), the case law draws a distinction between (a) <span class="font-italic">regular </span>default judgments which have been properly entered into and (b) <span class="font-italic">irregular </span>default judgments which have been entered into by a claimant who had itself been in breach of procedural rules. This distinction reflects the court’s concern with the <span class="font-italic">reasons </span>for the defendant’s setting-aside application, which would affect the factors relevant to the exercise of its discretionary powers and the approach to be taken in determining if the default judgment was to be set aside (see also <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”), the relevant Orders relating to judgments in default of appearance or default of pleadings (see O 13 and O 19) each contain a rule stating that the court may “set aside or vary any judgment entered in pursuance of this Order” (see O 13 r 8 and O 19 r 9). The ROC 2021 is slightly different in that, instead of a similar rule specified in connection with each type of default judgment that can be obtained by a claimant under O 6 rr 6, 7 and 9, the power of the court to set aside any such default judgment obtained by the claimant is now expressed in O 3 r 2(8), which is a general provision intended to emphasise the “far-ranging inherent jurisdiction of the court” to set aside its judgments or orders obtained in specified circumstances, so long as doing so was in the interests of justice (see also <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2022 </span>vol I<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2022) at para 3/2/8). Order 3 r 2(8) of the ROC 2021 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court may, on its own accord or upon application, if it is in the interests of justice, revoke any judgment or order obtained or set aside anything which was done —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) without notice to, or in the absence of, the party affected;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) without complying with these Rules or any order of Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) contrary to any written law; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) by fraud or misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It goes without saying that the distinction between regular and irregular default judgments continues to be relevant under the ROC 2021. Although O 3 r 2(8) specifies a list of circumstances in which the court’s judgments or orders (which would include a default judgment) may be set aside, as a provision giving expression to the court’s inherent<span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction, it is obviously not the intention of O 3 r 2(8) to delineate or circumscribe the circumstances in which that inherent jurisdiction may be exercised. The court’s discretionary powers to set aside a default judgment stem from its inherent jurisdiction (see [19] above), and how<span class="font-italic"> </span>those discretionary powers are to be exercised would depend on the application of established common law principles, namely, whether the default judgment in question is regular or irregular (see [20] above). In any case, I add that the setting aside of an irregular default judgment comes within O 3 r 2(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (since such a judgment would be one obtained by the plaintiff without compliance with the Rules) while the setting aside of a regular default judgment comes within O 3 r 2(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (since any default judgment obtained under O 6 rr 6, 7 or 9 of the ROC 2021 would necessarily have been obtained in the absence of the defendant). I further add that the provision in O 3 r 2(8) that a judgment or order be set aside if it is “in the interests of justice” does not, in my view, add new substantive criteria that the court has to consider in determining whether a default judgment is to be set aside. It is trite that the rules of procedure<span class="font-italic"> </span>– of which the court’s discretionary powers to set aside a default judgment and the distinction between regular and irregular default judgments form part – ultimately exist to serve the ultimate and overriding objective of substantive justice (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [99], citing <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hor Peow Victor </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 at [82]), and the words “in the interests of justice” in O 3 r 2(8) merely gives expression to this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Where the case concerns a <span class="font-italic">regular </span>default judgment, the legal burden is on the defendant to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence in the sense of showing that there are triable or arguable issues (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60]). The merits of the defence, while a highly significant consideration in its own right, is not the sole consideration that the court takes into account in deciding whether to set aside a regular default judgment, and it is to be balanced against all other relevant considerations, such as the defendant’s explanation for the default and for any delay in pursuing the setting-aside application, as well as any prejudice caused to the other party (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Where the case concerns an <span class="font-italic">irregular </span>default judgment, the starting point is that the default judgment is to be set aside pursuant to an application of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule, which provides for the defendant’s entitlement to set aside an irregular default judgment as of right (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67] and [76]). The legal burden is then on the claimant to persuade the court that the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule should not be applied, with the consequence that the starting point is departed from (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [98]). The key question for the court, when deciding whether to adhere to or depart from the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule, is whether there has been such an egregious breach of the rules of procedural justice, and in connection with which the following factors are relevant: (a) the blameworthiness of the respective parties – the nature of the irregularity, whether the breach of procedural rules by the claimant had been committed in bad faith and/or whether there was undue delay by the defendant in filing the setting-aside application; (b) whether the defendant had taken a fresh step in the proceedings after becoming aware of the irregular default judgment; and (c) whether the defendant would be unduly prejudiced if the irregular default judgment was allowed to stand (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [76] and [96]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 If the court concludes that the breach of the rules of procedural justice is not of such an egregious nature that warrants the default judgment being set aside as of right, the court goes on to consider whether there is nonetheless some other basis, apart from the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitae</span> rule, pursuant to which the irregular default judgment may be set aside (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [77]). Similarly, the legal burden to persuade the court that some other basis for setting aside exists, apart from the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule, falls on the claimant (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [92]). At this juncture, one of the most crucial factors to be considered is the merits of the defence, and it is for the claimant to show that the defendant is “bound to fail” even if the irregular default judgment were set aside and the matter re-litigated (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [92] and [96]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>also emphasised two points that are relevant in this analysis: (a) first, the threshold of “bound to fail” is obviously distinct from the test of showing a triable issue or a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence; (b) secondly, the court must take a nuanced approach when applying the “bound to fail” test and have regard to the nature of the irregularity and the overall justice of the case, and in particular, avoid an outcome where the claimant is allowed to take advantage of its own non-compliance with the procedural rules (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I now turn to the parties’ submissions.

</div> Although NWC did not state so expressly, it would follow from this that it was also its position that HKE failed to demonstrate a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence, and so there was no ground for setting aside, even if the part of JUD 252 relating to the claims under the Naptha Agreement were a regular default judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Before setting out the issues, I make three observations. First, I considered it appropriate in this case to regard the part of JUD 252 relating to NWC’s claims under the Naptha Agreement (“the Naptha JUD”) as being separate from the part of JUD 252 relating to NWC’s claims under the Gasoil Agreement (“the Gaosoil JUD”), so that the setting aside of each of those parts of JUD 252 was considered separately. As the High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Powercom</span><span class="font-italic"> Yuraku Pte Ltd v Sunpower Semiconductor Ltd and others </span>[2023] 4 SLR 867 (“<span class="font-italic">Powercom</span><span class="font-italic"> Yuraku</span>”) (at [15]) in the context of a default judgment obtained under the ROC 2014, the court possesses the discretion to set aside a default judgment only in part, rather than wholly, because among other things, the relevant rule on setting aside in the ROC 2014 was drafted in broad terms and allowed the court to “set aside <span class="font-italic">or vary any judgment</span>” [emphasis in original]. Although O 3 r 2(8) is worded in different terms from its equivalents in the ROC 2014, given its broad language (see [21] above), it is not inconsistent with, and suggests that the court continues to enjoy, a discretion to set aside a default judgment wholly or in part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, it was justified to view the Gasoil JUD and the Naptha JUD as separate for the following reasons: (a) first, the Gasoil JUD is undisputedly an irregular default judgment (see [28] above), unlike the Naptha JUD, the regularity of which turned on whether the operative contract for the Naptha Agreement contained a contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3); and (b) secondly, the transactions to which the claims under the Naptha Agreement and the Gasoil Agreement respectively relate are separate and distinct and each involve an independent factual matrix (see [6] and [9] above), and so matters relating to the merits of HKE’s defences in respect of each of those claims, which may be relevant in the determination of whether JUD 252 is to be set aside, have to be analysed separately, and it was consistent with that for the Gasoil JUD and the Naptha JUD to be dealt with separately. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Secondly, I noted that the only dispute raised by HKE in challenging JUD 252 is that NWC failed to obtain approval of court pursuant to O 8 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021 before serving the Cause Papers on HKE in Hong Kong. HKE did not dispute that service of the Cause Papers on HKE by way of registered post at the Kowloon Address was an effective method of service. Thus, the question of whether HKE had been properly served with the originating process in OC 295 only raised the issue of whether NWC’s failure to obtain approval of court for service out of Singapore pursuant to O 8 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021 had rendered service of originating process improper. This issue only had to be considered with respect to the Naptha JUD, to which the Law and Jurisdiction clause in the Written Contract was relevant. In respect of the Gasoil JUD, service is undisputedly improper given NWC’s acceptance that the Gasoil Agreement – the terms of which the parties were in agreement on (see [13] above) – contained no provision whatsoever relating to the service of processes for legal proceedings. For completeness, I noted that, although HKE appears to have alleged that the service of the Cause Papers by registered post at the Kowloon Address did not bring OC 295 to its attention (see [16] above), this was not a ground that HKE relied on in SUM 2812 in arguing that there was improper service that rendered the Naptha JUD irregular and therefore did not arise for consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Finally, there was in my view also a threshold issue as to whether the Recap Terms, on which HKE relied primarily in challenging the Naptha JUD (see [11] and [26(a)] above), was relevant in determining whether the Naptha JUD is a regular or an irregular default judgment. In so far as HKE contended that the Law and Jurisdiction clause does not constitute a contract that allowed for service out of Singapore coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021 and therefore the Naptha JUD is irregularly<span class="font-italic"> </span>obtained, that contention raises no difficulty because it is simply a matter of assessing whether NWC had been entitled to obtain the Naptha JUD in view of the materials that it had relied on when applying for the Naptha JUD. However, to the extent that HKE contended that the Naptha JUD is irregular because the operative contract between the parties is found in the Recap Terms and not the Written Contract and so for that reason there was no contract between the parties that allowed for service out of Singapore, this raised some difficulty because NWC did not rely on the Recap Terms in applying for JUD 252. Can the court even consider the Recap Terms, which NWC had not relied on in obtaining JUD 252, in determining if the Naptha JUD is regular or irregular? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Accordingly, the following issues arose for determination in SUM 2812: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the Recap Terms were relevant in determining if the Naptha JUD is regular or irregular?   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If not, whether the Law and Jurisdiction clause in the Written Contract constitutes a contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021, and in view of this, whether the Naptha JUD is regular or irregular? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If both the Naptha JUD and the Gasoil JUD are irregular<span class="font-italic"> </span>default judgments, whether (i) the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule should be adhered to and the default judgments be set aside as of right; or (ii) if not, whether there was nevertheless some other ground for the default judgments to be set aside, and in particular, whether HKE’s defence to NWC’s claims under the Naptha Agreement and the Gasoil Agreement were “bound to fail”?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the Naptha JUD was a regular<span class="font-italic"> </span>default judgment, whether (i) HKE has shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence to NWC’s claims under the Naptha Transaction; and (ii) if so, whether the Naptha JUD should be set aside in the circumstances of this case? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Recap Terms were relevant in determining if the Naptha JUD is regular or irregular  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([19] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [74]–[77] and [96]), in the context of irregular default judgments, the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule operates as the starting point, and the questions to be asked by a court are: (a) whether the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule should be adhered to or departed from; and (b) if the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule is to be departed from, whether there is nonetheless some other sufficient reason which justifies the setting aside of the default judgment, one of which is that the defendant’s defence on the merits is “bound to fail”. The claimant seeking for the irregular default judgment to be upheld bears the legal burden in respect of the latter two questions, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [98]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The defendant’s setting-aside application will ordinarily be dismissed only if the plaintiff manages to convince the court <span class="font-italic">both</span> that, first, the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule should not be followed <span class="font-italic">and</span>, second, the defence is bound to fail. In other words … where the defendant seeks to set aside an <span class="font-italic">irregular </span>default judgment, it is for the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff </span>to show (after it has successfully persuaded the court that the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule should not be applied) the lack of merit in the defence – based on the ‘<span class="font-italic">bound to lose</span>’ test – for the purposes of countering the defendant’s setting-aside application. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendant’s burden in an application to set aside an irregular default judgment therefore only requires it to establish that the case is one in which the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule ought to operate. The operation of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule, which provides for a defendant’s entitlement to set aside an irregular default judgment <span class="font-italic">as of right</span>, turns solely on whether there had been an <span class="font-italic">irregularity </span>in the default judgment (see <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]). This requires an assessment of whether the default judgment in question had been obtained in compliance with or in breach of the relevant procedural rules. To this end, the overarching question is whether the claimant had been procedurally entitled to the default judgment at the material time, in view of the procedural grounds on which it relied in obtaining the default judgment. How this question is answered operates as the dividing line between a regular and an irregular default judgment. As explained in B C Cairns, <span class="font-italic">Australian Civil Procedure </span>(9th Ed, Lawbook Co, 2011) (at para 12.290): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For a default judgment to be regular it must strictly comply with the rules and be for the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled on the pleading. The record must show the plaintiff to have a right to the judgment, and the judgment entered must follow the relief claimed. If these requirements are not met the judgment is irregular and it will be set aside. … Apart from this, the court record must show that all the necessary interlocutory steps were properly followed in entering the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 That the question of whether a default judgment is regular or irregular turns solely on whether the claimant had been procedurally entitled to the default judgment at the material time, has some significance on the scope of matters that can be relevant where a defendant seeks to challenge a default judgment as being irregular. First, the focus of the defendant’s challenge ought to be based on the procedural grounds that the claimant had relied on in obtaining the default judgment and whether those grounds were satisfied at the material time when the default judgment had been applied for. In discharging its legal burden, the defendant need not delve into the merits of its defence and why the claimant is substantively not entitled to the judgment sought, unlike the case involving a regular default judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Secondly, and following from the first point, what is of most immediate relevance to a defendant in demonstrating that the claimant had not been procedurally entitled to the default judgment at the time of obtaining the same, ought to be the material and grounds that the claimant had relied on when applying for the default judgment. At the time when the application for default judgment is made, the court determines if the default judgment should be granted by reference to the materials and grounds on which the claimant relies in support of the application. Where the regularity of the default judgment subsequently comes under challenge and the procedural entitlement of the claimant to the default judgment comes under scrutiny, the question being asked is whether the claimant was procedurally entitled to the default judgment in view of the materials and grounds that the claimant had relied on; the court does not consider <span class="font-italic">afresh </span>the question of whether the application for default judgment ought to have been granted in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 With these principles in mind, I considered whether the Recap Terms were relevant in determining the Naptha JUD is regular or irregular. In this case, JUD 252 was obtained pursuant to O 6 r 6 of the ROC 2021. Reading O 6 r 6 as a whole, there are the following procedural requirements to be be satisfied, before a claimant can come to be entitled to a default judgment pursuant to that rule: (a) the defendant must have been “served” an originating claim, whether “in Singapore” or “out of Singapore”; (b) the defendant failed to file and serve a notice of intention to contest or not contest within the relevant prescribed time (14 days or 21 days, depending on whether the defendant was served within or out of Singapore); and (c) the application for default judgment is made in the prescribed form and accompanied by a Memorandum of Service filed by the claimant. Whether NWC was procedurally entitled to JUD 252 (and more specifically the Naptha JUD) turns on whether the threefold procedural requirements of O 6 r 6 have been satisfied. According to the Memorandum of Service dated 2 June 2023, HKE was served with the Cause Papers by way of registered post at the Kowloon Address on 2 June 2023. The application for JUD 252 was filed on 26 June 2023, and by that time, no notice of intention to contest or not contest had been filed by HKE. For these reasons, it is not in dispute that the requirements in (b) and (c), when considered in isolation from the issue of whether that had been proper service of originating process, are satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The only issue is whether the requirement in (a) has been satisfied – that is, whether HKE has been properly served the originating process in OC 295. This issue is to be assessed with reference to the materials and grounds that NWC had relied on when it applied for JUD 252. NWC did not rely on the Recap Terms in applying for JUD 252; it relied solely on the Written Contract and in particular that the Written Contract contained the Law and Jurisdiction clause which permitted for service of the Cause Papers on HKE in Hong Kong by way of registered post. The Recap Terms, which did not form part of the grounds and materials that NWC had relied on in applying for JUD 252, were therefore not relevant in determining whether the Naptha JUD is a regular or an irregular default judgment. The question of whether HKE had been properly served the originating process in OC 295 therefore turned solely on whether the Law and Jurisdiction clause in the Written Contract constitutes a contract which allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3) and thus rendered it unnecessary for NWC to obtain approval of court before serving the Cause Papers on HKE, in so far as the claims under the Naptha Agreement were concerned. It is to this issue that I next turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Law and Jurisdiction clause constitutes a contract that allowed for service of originating process out of Singapore without prior approval of court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For ease of reference, I reproduce here the Law and Jurisdiction clause of the Written Contract: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the English law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, <span class="font-italic">shall be referred to and finally resolved by Singapore court [sic] without recourse to arbitration and to service of process by registered mail</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Despite the rather clunky language of the words in italics, the parties were not in dispute that the <span class="font-italic">literal </span>meaning (in contradistinction with its legal effect, a matter which was disputed) of the Law and Jurisdiction clause is an <span class="font-italic">agreement </span>between the parties to the Written Contract for service of originating process on either party to the contract by registered post. To reiterate, the material question is whether this part of the Written Contract gives rise to a “contract between the parties” that allowed for “service out of Singapore” within the meaning of O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021, so that no prior approval of the court was required for NWC to serve originating process in OC 295 on HKE in Hong Kong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The main argument made by HKE’s counsel was that the Law and Jurisdiction clause is deficient and does not give rise to an agreement coming within O 8 r 1(3) because it only provides for a <span class="font-italic">method </span>of service but does not specify <span class="font-italic">where </span>originating process was to be served, namely, that such service could take place outside of Singapore. Counsel argued that, for an agreement to give rise to a contract that allowed for service out of jurisdiction coming within the scope of O 8 r 1(3), it must have some minimum content, and O 10 r 3 of the ROC 2014, which sets out one of four methods of service provided for under the ROC 2014, was instructive. Order 10 r 3 states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.—(1)  Where —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a contract contains a term to the effect that the Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action in respect of a contract or, apart from any such term, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine any such action; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the contract provides that, in the event of any action in respect of the contract being begun, the process by which it is begun may be served on the defendant, or on such other person on his behalf as may be specified in the contract, <span class="font-italic">in such manner or at such place (whether within or out of the jurisdiction)</span>, as may be so specified, then if an action in respect of the contract is begun in the Court and the writ by which it is begun is served in accordance with the contract the writ shall, subject to paragraph (2), be deemed to have been duly served on the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Placing emphasis on the italicised words, counsel argued that any contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021 must state, not only the <span class="font-italic">manner </span>or <span class="font-italic">method </span>of service (on which count the Law and Jurisdiction clause was not deficient) but also the <span class="font-italic">place </span>at which such service was to be effected (which the Law and Jurisdiction clause did not specify). Counsel argued that, notwithstanding the absence of an equivalent of O 10 r 3 in the ROC 2021, that rule was nevertheless instructive in how O 8 r 1(3) should be interpreted. Counsel further emphasised that, since a plaintiff under the ROC 2014 had to obtain leave for service out of jurisdiction pursuant to O 11 even where there existed a contract coming within the scope of O 10 r 3, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, the requirements attaching to a “contract” coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021 cannot be any lesser than those imposed by O 10 r 3, as permission for service out of jurisdiction was no longer required under the ROC 2021 in a case to which O 8 r 1(3) applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At this juncture, I make two observations. First, O 10 r 3 of the ROC 2014 provides for a <span class="font-italic">method </span>of service. It is not a rule providing for service out of jurisdiction, which is contained in O 11 of the ROC 2014. The equivalent of O 10 r 3 in the ROC 2021 can be found at O 7 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), which states that personal service may be effected “in any manner agreed with the person or the entity to be served”. Order 7 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is less prescriptive than O 10 r 3 of the ROC 2014 and does not specify the matters which the parties must agree on, before it can constitute an agreement for service coming within the Rules of Court. Secondly, O 10 r 3 of the ROC 2014 was in any event not a comprehensive code on the form of agreements that parties could make with respect to service of process. As the High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Assets Management Ltd and others v Chen Lip Keong </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 658 (at [8]), apart from O 10 r 3, the parties could reach an agreement between themselves as to another mode of service of a writ outside of the Rules of Court. It would appear that O 7 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) has been worded in recognition of the position at common law, and any <span class="font-italic">agreement </span>that the parties had reached with respect of service was recognised as an effective method of service, without having to come within certain confines of the Rules of Court or contain particular terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At the outset, let me also state that I disagreed with counsel that only an agreement specifying the <span class="font-italic">method </span>of service and the <span class="font-italic">place </span>at which service was to be effected is capable of coming within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021. Such a narrow interpretation is contrary to the literal meaning of O 8 r 1(3). There is nothing in O 8 r 1(3) or indeed in the “Definitions” section in O 1 r 4 which suggests that a “contract” coming within O 8 r 1(3) must minimally provide for the <span class="font-italic">method </span>of service and the <span class="font-italic">place </span>at which service was to be effected. Crucially, O 8 r 1(3) uses the words “service <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">out </span>of Singapore” and not “service <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">outside </span>of Singapore” [emphasis added in bold italics]. This, as I explain later, is of some significance (see [53] below). In any case, affording such a narrow interpretation to O 8 r 1(3) would run contrary to what I have posited is the likely intent behind O 7 r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), which appears to have been worded in recognition of the position at common law that parties were free to agree on methods of service, and that such <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> methods were effective without having to come within the strict confines of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">How should O 8 r 1(3) be interpreted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I now turn to consider how O 8 r 1(3) proper. To facilitate the discussion that follows, I reproduce it in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court’s approval is not required if <span class="font-italic">service out of Singapore </span>is allowed under a contract between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The critical question is what it means for a contract to allow for “service out of Singapore” within the meaning of O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021. This is an exercise in the interpretation of a legislative provision like O 8 r 1(3), to which the following principles are relevant (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [37]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court’s task when undertaking a purposive interpretation of a legislative provision involves three steps:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As a starting point in this exercise, I do not think the following can be disputed: (a) first, a contract allowing<span class="font-italic"> </span>for “service out of Singapore” is a contract between the parties that provides<span class="font-italic"> </span>for “service out of Singapore” or put another way, an agreement between the parties for “service out of Singapore”; and (b) secondly, having regard to O 8 r 1(1), “service” in O 8 r 1(3) must refer to the service of “[a]n originating process or other court document” issued by the Singapore courts. Therefore, the only remaining question is the meaning that is to be attached to the words “service <span class="font-italic">out of Singapore</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 There were in my view two possible interpretations of “service out of Singapore”. First, interpreting these words literally, it meant that an agreement could only come within O 8 r 1(3) if it expressly provided for the service of originating process at a location other than Singapore, whether by stating that: (a) originating process could be served at a <span class="font-italic">specified location</span> that is not Singapore; or (b) originating process could be served <span class="font-italic">outside </span>of Singapore but without specifying any such location at which it is to be served. Secondly, and in the alternative, an agreement could come within O 8 r 1(3) even if it did not expressly state that originating process could be served at a location other than Singapore or outside of Singapore, so long as the agreement is one for the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on a defendant who is not ordinarily located within Singapore (hereafter referred to as a “foreign defendant”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The relationship between jurisdiction and service of originating process sheds some light on the purpose and object of O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021. I begin with two principles of trite law. First, the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts is <span class="font-italic">territorial</span> – the court has jurisdiction as of right over a defendant who is <span class="font-italic">within </span>Singapore, but jurisdiction over a foreign defendant is discretionary (see <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [26]). Secondly, the service of originating process operates as one of the main or primary avenues by which the civil jurisdiction of the Singapore courts can be established (see <span class="font-italic">COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers Co, Ltd v PT OKI Pulp &amp; Paper Mills and others </span>[2023] SGHC 149 at [25]). Section 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) provides that the civil jurisdiction of the General Division of the High Court is founded over a defendant where the defendant is served with originating process in Singapore, or outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised by the Rules of Court. Order 8 r 1(1) of the ROC 2021 authorises the service of originating process out of Singapore only where approval of court has been obtained, in reflection of the principle that the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts over a foreign defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a defendant that is located outside of Singapore, is discretionary. Thus, where a defendant is located outside of Singapore and thus beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, the claimant has to seek approval of the court to serve originating process on the foreign defendant pursuant to O 8 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021, and the jurisdiction of the Singapore court over the foreign defendant is established only where originating process is validly served on the foreign defendant pursuant to the approval of the Singapore courts for service out of jurisdiction (see also <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The purpose of O 8 r 1(3) is to render it unnecessary for the claimant to obtain approval of the court under O 8 r 1(2) for service of originating process on a foreign defendant. Having regard to the territorial nature of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction, the role of service of process in establishing the jurisdiction of the court over a defendant, and the fact that ordinarily, the originating process of the Singapore courts may only be validly served on a foreign defendant pursuant to the court’s approval under O 8 r 1(2), it implies that what a foreign defendant must have agreed to as part of any contract allowing for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3), is that the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts can be founded over him by way of service of originating process, notwithstanding him not being within the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Because the foreign defendant had agreed that the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts could be established over him by the service of originating process, it is unnecessary for the claimant to go through the redundant step of obtaining the approval of the court to serve originating process on a foreign defendant, and this accordingly brings the case within O 8 r 1(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having regard to the identified purpose of O 8 r 1(3) and the scenario which it is intended to capture, an agreement for “service out of Singapore” coming within that rule is one where a foreign defendant had agreed to the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on him, so that any service of originating process pursuant to the method contemplated by the agreement necessarily also meant service out of Singapore. What a foreign defendant must consent to – where the foreign defendant agrees for the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts to be founded over him by way of service of originating process – is the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on him, in his capacity as a foreign defendant, who is otherwise not within the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. It is not an essential part of such an agreement that he also consents to <span class="font-italic">where </span>the originating process of the Singapore courts is to be served. The second of the two possible interpretations of “service out of Singapore” (see [49] above) therefore achieves greater consistency with the purpose of O 8 r 1(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Further, the language of O 8 r 1(3) also supports the second of the two possible interpretations, and that it is not an essential part of an agreement coming within O 8 r 1(3) that a foreign defendant must also agree as to <span class="font-italic">where </span>the originating process of the Singapore courts is to be served. Order 8 r 1(3) uses the language service “out” of Singapore, and not service “outside” of Singapore. If the intention was for an agreement to come within O 8 r 1(3) only where it provided for service of process at a location other than Singapore, the word “outside” would have been used. The reference to “service out of Singapore” in O 8 r 1(3) is essentially a reference to the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on a foreign defendant as provided for in O 8 r 1(1), which ordinarily can only be performed where approval of court is obtained pursuant to O 8 r 1(2). Where O 8 r 1(3) applies because the foreign defendant agreed to “service out of Singapore”, what the foreign defendant would have agreed to is the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on him, without the claimant having to obtain the prior approval of the court. As I have mentioned earlier, it is not an essential part of such an agreement that the foreign defendant also agrees on where he is to be served; the essence of the agreement is that the foreign defendant, in his capacity as a foreign defendant, agrees to be served the originating process of the Singapore courts, notwithstanding him not being within the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts (see [52] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Additionally, in my view, the second of the two possible interpretations of “service out of Singapore” also achieves consistency with the Ideals of achieving “expeditious proceedings” and “efficient use of court resources” in O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC 2021 (“the Identified Ideals”). Where O 8 r 1(3) applies, any service of originating process on the defendant would be effective to found the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts over him, even if no prior approval of the court under O 8 r 1(2) for service out of Singapore had been obtained. Therefore, it would not be open to a foreign defendant who was served pursuant to an agreement coming within O 8 r 1(3) to dispute the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction over him, and he is only limited to challenging whether a Singapore court ought to <span class="font-italic">exercise </span>its jurisdiction over him on natural forum grounds (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court: A Practice Guide 2023 Edition </span>(Chua Lee Ming editor-in-chief) (Academy Publishing, 2023) at p 131; see also <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications </span>at [27] and [34]). If the first of the two possible interpretations of “service out of Singapore” were adopted, and so an agreement coming within O 8 r 1(3) must specify the location at which originating process is to be served or that it be served outside of Singapore, it effectively allows the foreign defendant to resort to a play of words and technicalities in seeking to mount challenges to the existence of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction over him, even if the case on a whole can only be understood as one where the foreign defendant had agreed to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts being founded over him by service of originating process. Such a result would be plainly inconsistent with the Identified Ideals as it protracts the proceedings and wastes court resources on apparently unmeritorious jurisdictional challenges. On the other hand, the second of the two possible interpretations would prevent the foreign defendant from mounting challenges against the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction if he had agreed to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts being founded over him by service of originating process, a result which is consistent with and furthers the Identified Ideals. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For the reasons above, in my view, a contract that allows for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3) is simply an agreement for the service of originating process of the Singapore courts on a foreign defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a defendant who is not ordinarily located within Singapore. Where this is the case, the defendant to be served is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, and so any service of originating process on that defendant pursuant to the parties’ agreement necessarily also meant service out of Singapore. For the agreement to come within O 8 r 1(3), it is not a requirement that it specifies that originating process of the Singapore courts is to be served at a location other than Singapore or outside of Singapore. Of course, if the parties to an agreement are ordinarily not within the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, and the agreement expressly provides that originating process could be served on either or both parties to the dispute at a location other than Singapore or outside Singapore, then the case unambiguously comes within O 8 r 1(3), but this ought <span class="font-italic">not </span>to be<span class="font-italic"> </span>an essential requirement of an agreement coming within O 8 r 1(3). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Law and Jurisdiction clause gave rise to a contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3)?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 With the above in mind, I considered whether the Law and Jurisdiction clause gives rise to a contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” coming within O 8 r 1(3). In my view, this had to be answered in the affirmative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Reading the Law and Jurisdiction clause in context with the remainder of the Written Contract, it could only be understood as one where HKE agreed to the service of originating process of the Singapore courts by the method specified in the Law and Jurisdiction clause, in its capacity as a foreign defendant. In other words, HKE agreed to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts being founded over it by way of service of originating process pursuant to the mode specified in the Law and Jurisdiction clause, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, registered post. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clauses 1 and 2 of the Written Contract record NWC and HKE respectively as the parties to the agreement, and in particular, it specifies the Kowloon Address as HKE’s place of business. I should add that HKE did not in SUM 2812 dispute the Kowloon Address as being its address, and affidavits filed by HKE in support of SUM 2812 also identified the Kowloon Address as HKE’s address. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Law and Jurisdiction clause provided that disputes arising from the Written Contract are to be resolved by the Singapore courts, and that parties agreed to “service of process by registered mail”. Given the near-immediate reference to the Singapore courts, any reference to service of process must refer to the service of process <span class="font-italic">of the Singapore courts</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By agreeing to the <span class="font-italic">service of process by registered mail</span> notwithstanding it not being ordinarily resident or having a place of business within Singapore, a fact which is undisputed given clause 2 of the Written Contract (see [57(c)] above), HKE agreed to the service of originating process of the Singapore courts by registered post in its capacity as a foreign defendant. In other words, HKE agreed to the Singapore courts founding its jurisdiction over it by way of service of originating process by registered post, notwithstanding it not being within the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For these reasons, the Law and Jurisdiction clause constitutes a contract that allowed for “service out of Singapore” within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021 and so there was no need for NWC to obtain approval of the Singapore courts before serving originating process on HKE by registered post in respect of the claims arising under the Naptha Agreement. Accordingly, the service of the Cause Papers on HKE on 2 June 2023, in so far as the claims under the Naptha Agreement were concerned, is not improper. The Naptha JUD is therefore a regular default judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Gasoil JUD is to be set aside as of right or on some other basis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 With the above, the question of whether the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule ought to be adhered to or departed from need only be considered in connection with the Gasoil JUD.

I arrived at this conclusion namely for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, and most significantly, the nature of the procedural irregularity in respect of the Gasoil JUD is <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span>. The jurisdiction of a court is its authority to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it (see <span class="font-italic">Muhd Munir v Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Hidah and other applications </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 348 at [19]). The Singapore court had <span class="font-italic">no </span>jurisdiction over HKE, in so far as the claims under the Gasoil Agreement were concerned, because NWC failed to obtain approval of court for service of originating process on HKE pursuant to O 8 r 1(2), and HKE, being a foreign defendant that is outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, also did not agree to have the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts established over it by way of service of process. NWC had obtained the Gasoil JUD in circumstances where the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction had not even been established over HKE in connection with the claims under the Gasoil JUD. This, in my view, constitutes one of those “plain instances of injustice that offend the essence of due process” (see <span class="font-italic">Mecurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [76]) in which a court would readily set aside the irregular default judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Secondly, the circumstances of this case militated in favour of the court exercising its discretion in <span class="font-italic">adhering </span>to the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debtio justitiae </span>rule. There was no undue delay on HKE’s part in taking steps to have JUD 252 set aside. After JUD 252 was obtained on 26 June 2023, HKE took no further steps in the Singapore proceedings, save for its appointment of solicitors on 18 July 2023 and the subsequent Request for Permission to file an application for extension of time made on 19 July 2023, which in the event was filed a day later on 20 July 2023. According to HKE, it was only notified of JUD 252 on 5 July 2023 after NWC wrote to it demanding payment of sums due under JUD 252.

</div> This does not appear to have been disputed by NWC, but in any case, the period of time between 27 June 2023 and 19 July 2023 would not have amounted to “undue delay”, and that is all the more so if I were to accept that HKE only became notified of JUD 252 on 5 July 2023. Furthermore, it is significant that NWC had proceeded to obtain the Gasoil JUD, despite being apparently aware that the materials it had relied on in obtaining the Gasoil JUD made no provision for service of originating process on HKE in Hong Kong without prior approval of the court under O 8 r 1(2) – the written version of the Gasoil Agreement exhibited in the SOC does not contain any provision relating to service of process for legal proceedings, and it is also not NWC’s case in the SOC that the Written Contract applied in respect of the Gasoil Transaction. It would certainly be prejudicial to HKE if the Gasoil JUD were allowed to stand. For the avoidance of doubt, however, I do not make any finding on whether NWC’s improper service of originating process on HKE in respect of the claims under the Gasoil Agreement had been committed in bad faith, a point which was not argued. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Naptha JUD is to be set aside on account of the merits of HKE’s defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I now turn to the question of whether the Naptha JUD, which is a regular default judgment, is to be set aside. In this analysis, the merits of HKE’s defence was a highly significant factor, though it nevertheless had to be assessed and balanced against other relevant considerations (see <span class="font-italic">Mecurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([19] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On this issue, the differing accounts that the parties had proffered in respect of the Naptha Transaction had to be considered. As I have set out in the introduction of these grounds, NWC’s case is that the terms of the Naptha Agreement are contained in the Written Contract (see [6] above). In its affidavit for SUM 2812, NWC further averred the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While it did not dispute the existence of the 19 Dec Deal Recap, NWC stated that the terms of the parties’ contractual relationship were eventually reduced in writing and culminated in the Written Contract. NWC accepted that the Written Contract had not been signed by either party in writing, but it attributes this to the fact that the communications between the parties took place mostly over phone or by WhatsApp messaging.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The parties’ contrary accounts, which starkly contradict each other, raise obvious disputes of fact that can only be ventilated through a full fact-finding process at trial. There were at least four triable issues and in respect of each of them I was satisfied that HKE had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether the operative contract for the Naptha Agreement is contained in the Written Contract or the Recap Terms. Questions about the significance of HKE’s lack of response to the Written Contract sent over by NWC on 3 March 2023 – whether it was because HKE did not accept the Written Contract, or because HKE had in fact acknowledged those terms, as NWC’s counsel argued – can only be resolved with the benefit of fuller evidence at trial. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, whether there had been an agreement between the parties for the payment terms of the Naptha Agreement to be varied, and in particular, for the issuer of the AOP to be varied from SCB to CIMB. NWC claimed that such an agreement was reached through a phone conversation between itself and HKE, while this was denied by HKE, which maintained that NWC knew at the outset from the parties’ discussions that the issuer of the AOP had to be acceptable by HKE’s supplier and that NWC was informed by HKE that the variation of the AOP issuer was unacceptable. Whether NWC’s or HKE’s account is true requires cross-examination of the relevant witness testimony and an examination of all other evidence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the reasons as to why the cargo was not delivered, and whether this was a result of NWC’s breach or HKE’s breach. In this regard, I found it significant that HKE was able to point to contemporaneous documentary evidence which showed that it had procured cargo within the required contractual specifications, and that it had entered into a charterparty for the delivery of cargo.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, if HKE had been in breach, whether NWC was entitled to recover from HKE losses arising from NWC’s failure to fulfil its contract with PTT. HKE’s defence is that NWC never had any buyer for the cargo, and in any event, it was not aware of any such buyer NWC might have had. It also appeared from HKE’s allegations that it had suffered losses arising from its own contract with ENPC and the charterparty it purportedly entered into to carry the cargo, and so HKE might even have counterclaims against NWC in respect of HKE’s own losses arising out of the Naptha Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As it would be apparent from the above, I was satisfied that HKE had demonstrated a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence in respect of the entirety of NWC’s claims under the Naptha Agreement. This, in my view, was a sufficient factor in and of itself to justify the court’s exercise of discretion to set aside the Naptha JUD. I accept, of course, that HKE had been guilty of procedural default by failing to file its notice of intention to contest or not contest within the requisite timeline under O 6 r 6(2). It would however be disproportionate to the nature and gravity of this default to refuse to set aside the Naptha JUD when in fact HKE has an arguable defence to the entirety of the claims underlying the Naptha JUD, and the proper manner to account for HKE’s procedural default was through the costs orders to be made in SUM 2812 (see [69(a)] below), to which I will come later.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons above, I allowed HKE’s application to set aside the entirety of JUD 252. In respect of the Gasoil JUD, I found that it is an irregular default judgment that is to be set aside as of right. There had been an egregious breach of procedural justice because the improper service of originating process on HKE in respect of the claims under the Gasoil Agreement meant that the Gasoil JUD had been obtained without the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction over HKE being established in the first place, in so far as those claims were concerned. As for the Naptha JUD, I found that it is a regular default judgment because the Written Contract, on which NWC relied in obtaining JUD 252, contained an agreement that allowed for “service out of Singapore” within O 8 r 1(3) of the ROC 2021 and so service of the Cause Papers on HKE by way of registered post in respect of the claims under the Naptha Agreement was effective to found the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction over HKE. Nevertheless, I concluded that the Naptha JUD is to be set aside because HKE had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence to the entirety of NWC’s claims under the Naptha Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Turning now to the costs of SUM 2812, I noted the following guidance of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mecurine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([19] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [105]–[106]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a defendant typically bears the costs of a setting-aside application where a regular default judgment is set aside on the ground that the defence had sufficient merit; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a claimant typically bears the costs for the application if it involved the setting aside of an irregular default judgment; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the usual rule that costs follow the event should not be the starting point in an application to set aside an irregular default judgment, and even if a defendant fails to have an irregular default judgment set aside, it does not follow that the defendant ought to bear the costs of the application, and depending on the reasons for the irregularity, it may well be appropriate for the claimant instead to bear the costs of the setting aside application or for no costs orders to be made.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In this case, I found the Naptha JUD to be a regular default judgment but I set it aside on the ground of the merits of HKE’s defence, and as for the Gasoil JUD, I found it to be an irregular default judgment. In view of the guidance of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mecurine</span>, and in the circumstances of this case, I considered it appropriate to make no order as to costs and for the parties to bear their own costs for SUM 2812. As it would have been apparent from the structure of these grounds, the majority of the arguments in SUM 2812 had been dedicated to issues arising from the Naptha JUD rather than the Gasoil JUD, and so any such costs that HKE would have been entitled to in respect of the setting aside of the Gasoil JUD would have been lower than those costs that it would have been liable to pay NWC in respect of the setting aside of the Naptha JUD. That being said, I did not consider this as justifying NWC to recover any costs in respect of the setting aside of the Naptha JUD because it would be rather contrary to common sense for NWC to be paid any costs for SUM 2812, which ultimately was an application that in large part had been necessitated by NWC’s default of procedural rules in the first place.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Perry Peh<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Jong Han Rey (KSCGP Juris LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Levin Lin and Kirsten Siow (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
