<p xmlns="">dismissed Fook Gees claim for the repayment of the alleged loan. However, the she gave judgment

for Madam Lim against Lee Tat, for the balance of the purchase price.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The matter was taken to the Court of Appeal, which delivered its judgment on 6

February 1998. The Court of Appeal dismissed Fook Gees appeal. However, the appeal by Lee Tat was

allowed, on the ground that Madam Lim never had any interest in the joint venture site, and

consequently had no interest in the Property which she could sell.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">On 4 June 1998, Madam Ching, as executrix of Mr Tans estate, commenced the

present proceedings against Mr Liu seeking to recover the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent

of US$642,451.04 at the agreed rate of exchange at the time of payment to Mr Liu) as money had and

received, on the ground that the US$642,451.04 was paid to Mr Liu under a mistaken assumption that

Madam Lim had an interest in the Property. After further litigation, Madam Ching managed to amend

her statement of claim to include a claim for a remedial constructive trust.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The trial judge dismissed Madam Chings claims on two grounds. Firstly, it was

held that the true contracting parties in the sale of Madam Lims alleged interest to Lee Tat was

Madam Lim (as the purported vendor) and Lee Tat (as the purported purchaser). As such, any action

for money paid under a mistake ought to have been brought by Lee Tat against Madam Lim. Mr Tans

estate was not the proper plaintiff, and Mr Liu was not the proper defendant. Secondly, the trial

judge held that in any case, the claim was time barred, and no remedial constructive trust arose.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Madam Ching thus brought the present appeal. On the question of the proper

parties to the action, Madam Ching argued that the true contracting party to the joint venture was

Mr Liu, and that Madam Ching was purportedly conveyed the joint venture site as Mr Lius nominee.

As such, any interest in the joint venture site (and consequently in the Property) was supposed to

have been vested in Mr Liu. Conversely, when Lee Tat contracted to purchase the interest in the

Property from Mr Liu, it did so as Mr Tans nominee. Madam Ching thus contended that the true

contracting parties in the purported sale of Madam Lims interest in the Property to Lee Tat were

actually Mr Liu and Mr Tan, so that the parties were properly constituted for the present action.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">With regards to the issue of time bar, Madam Ching contended that the mistaken

assumption that Madam Lim had an interest in the Property was discovered only on 6 February 1998,

when the Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment. Madam Ching therefore claimed that the limitation

period began to run only as of that date, so her claim was not time-barred. Alternatively, Madam

Ching argued that when the Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment on 6 February 1998, Mr Liu could

no longer retain the monies without his conscience being affected. She thus contended that the

monies became impressed with a remedial constructive trust as of 6 February 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr Liu and nobody else. (

  22-25). Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate of Mr Tan, was thus entitled to bring this

  action against Mr Liu for the recovery of the sum paid to him. The proper parties were before the

  court ( 26).</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The trial judge was correct in holding that the six year limitation period

  found in s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act applied to Madam Chings claim ( 27). However, if the

  monies sought to be recovered were paid under a mistake, then by virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the

  Limitation Act, the limitation period would begin to run only as of the time when the mistake

  could have been discovered ( 28).</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The contention that the mistake underlying the payment could not have been

  discovered until the Court of Appeal delivered its decision on 6 February 1998 was rejected (

  29). In the 1984 action brought by Madam Lim, Mr Tan asserted in his affidavit, filed on 1

  February 1989, that Madam Lim had no interest in the Property. Thus, as of 1 February 1989, if not

  earlier, he had already discovered the mistake. Even if the limitation period was postponed by

  virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, the time bar would have set in by 1 February

  1995, at the latest ( 30). Section 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act states quite clearly that

  time begins to run once the plaintiff could with reasonable diligence have discovered the

  mistake. As far as s 29(1)(c) is concerned, it is the plaintiffs means of ascertaining the

  mistake, and not what the court eventually decides, that is relevant in determining when the

  limitation period begins to run ( 32).</p>
<p align="justify">(4) A remedial constructive trust arises where the court imposes a constructive

  trust de novo on assets which are not subject to any pre-existing trust as a means of granting

  equitable relief in a case where it considers just that restitution should be made ( 34). In

  order for a remedial constructive trust to arise, the payees conscience must have been

  affected, while the monies in question still remain with him. If the payee learns of the mistake

  only after the monies have got mixed with other funds or dissipated, no constructive trust in

  respect of these monies can arise. This is because there would no longer be an identifiable fund

  for the trust to bite ( 36).</p>
<p align="justify">(5) On the facts of this case, there was no ground for imposing a remedial

  constructive trust on Mr Liu in respect of the US$642,451.04 paid to him. The relationship between

  Mr Liu and Mr Tan was only that of a vendor and purchaser and was wholly commercial. There was no

  dishonest conduct on the part of Mr Liu. The sum was paid to Mr Liu in April 1981 with the intent

  that he was free to deal with it as his money. It was never intended by either Mr Tan or Mr Liu

  that it should be kept, and it had never been kept, distinct as an identifiable fund. On the basis

  of Mr Khoos contention that Mr Liu discovered the mistake only in February 1998 or thereabouts,

  there was a span of some 17 years and the sum paid to Mr Liu must have, in the meanwhile, been

  spent or mixed with other funds of Mr Liu. There was no sum or fund on which a remedy of

  constructive trust could be imposed by the court. The sum paid to Mr Liu was certainly not trust

  property. There was, of course, an obligation on the part of Mr Liu to return the monies to Mr

  Tan, but that was only a personal obligation ( 37).</p>

<p align="justify">1.    This was an appeal against the decision of Woo Bih Li JC, in

which he dismissed the claim of the appellant, Madam Ching Mun Fong (Madam Ching) suing as the

executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee deceased (Mr Tan), against the respondent, Mr Liu Cho

Chit (Mr Liu) for the sum of $1,386,420.71 (being the equivalent of US$642,451.01 at the rate

of exchange of S$2.13 to US$1) as money had and received. We dismissed the appeal and now give our

reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Background facts</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">2.    The material facts that led to this appeal stretch back to

some 27 years. The convenient starting point was 18 July 1972, when a company called Peng Ann

Realty Pte Ltd (Peng Ann) purchased a large parcel of land situate at Kampong Chai Chee,

comprising lots 21-26, 4-4, 4-7, 112, 122, 123 and 221 of Mukim 28 having an area of 186.7 acres. At

that time, there were three shareholders of the company, and Mr Liu was one of them. He was also the

managing director of the company. Two days after the sale and purchase agreement was made, there

appeared in the government gazette a notification of compulsory acquisition by the government of two

of the lots, namely, Lots 4-4 and 221. Being apprehensive of further compulsory acquisitions by the

government, Mr Liu and his co-directors decided to sell the remaining lots of land. In December

1972, Mr Liu was introduced to Mr Tan, who was interested in purchasing the remaining lots.

Negotiations took place between the two of them and eventually they reached an agreement. The

agreement was signed on 23 January 1973, and it was made between Peng Ann and one of Mr Tans

family companies, Lee Kai Investments Pte Ltd (Lee Kai) (then known as Collin Investment Pte

Ltd). Under the agreement, Peng Ann agreed to sell to Lee Kai three of the lots, namely, lots 21-26,

4-7 and 123, having a total area of 178 acres, at the price of $2,050,000.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    In the meanwhile, Mr Tan and Mr Liu had orally agreed to

enter into a joint venture to develop a small parcel of land containing an area of 5 acres, which

was within lot 21-26 and zoned residential (the joint venture site). The terms of this joint

venture were subsequently reduced into four written agreements (collectively called the joint

venture agreements). The agreement most material to the present appeal was the sub-sale agreement

of the joint venture site expressed to be made between on the one hand Lee Kai, and on the other Mr

Lius wife, Madam Lim Siam Soi (Madam Lim), and Mr Tans daughter, Collin Tan (Collin).

Under this sub-sale agreement, Lee Kai agreed to sell the joint venture site to Madam Lim and Collin

at the price of $50,000. The agreement was signed by Mr Tan on behalf of Lee Kai and Collin

respectively and by Mr Liu on behalf of Madam Lim. The other material joint venture agreements were

(i) a pre-incorporation agreement, whereby Collin and Madam Lim agreed to incorporate a joint

venture company, and (ii) a further sub-sale agreement, whereby Collin and Madam Lim agreed to

transfer to the joint venture company the joint venture site in exchange for shares to be issued by

that company to them respectively. These other agreements were also signed by Mr Tan on behalf of

Collin and by Mr Liu on behalf of Madam Lim. However, neither Collin nor Madam Lim was aware of the

agreements signed on their behalf or even of the joint venture itself.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    The sale of the three lots, 21-26, 4-7 and 123, by Peng Ann

to Lee Kai was completed on 14 March 1973, and the lots were conveyed, on the direction of Mr Tan

presumably on behalf of Lee Kai, to another company of Mr Tan, called Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (Lee

Tat) (then known as Collin Development Pte Ltd).</p>
<p align="justify">5.    On 23 July 1976, these three lots, except a portion

containing an area of 4.2 acres on Lot 21-26, were compulsorily acquired by the government. The

unacquired land comprised: (i) a portion of 3.7 acres of the joint venture site, and (ii) another

portion of about 21,808 sq ft of land, which was immediately adjoining the joint venture site and

zoned rural and was also part of Lot 21-26. The entire area of the unacquired land was subsequently

resurveyed and was described as resurvey Lot 1606 (the Property).</p>
<p align="justify">6.    As it transpired, the joint venture entered into between Mr

Tan and Mr Liu was not implemented. In particular, neither Mr Tan nor Mr Liu took any step to

implement or carry out the terms of any of the joint venture agreements. Nor did their respective

nominees, Madam Lim and Collin. Among other things, the proposed joint venture company was never

incorporated. In the result, the Property remained vested in Lee Tat and was never conveyed to Madam

Lim and Collin or the proposed joint venture company. To all intents and purposes, the joint venture

was abandoned.</p>
<p align="justify">7.    It was only in 1980 that Mr Tans and Mr Lius interests

in developing the Property revived. In that year they appointed a firm of architects to draw up

plans for the development of a housing project on the Property and planning approval was sought.

However, the negotiations between Mr Tan and Mr Liu to develop the property did not lead to

fruition, as they could not agree on the proposed development; each had in mind a different type of

development.</p>
<p align="justify">8.    All this while, Mr Liu claimed that he or his wife, Madam

Lim, had an interest in the Property and he offered to sell this interest to Mr Tan. According to Mr

Liu, he negotiated with Mr Tan on the price and Mr Tan agreed to purchase his or his wifes

interest in the Property at the price of $3.8 m net of tax and agreed to pay a sum of $2 m by

April 1981 and the balance two months later. On 23 April 1981, the parties met in Hong Kong, and Mr

Tan handed to Mr Liu two cashiers orders for the total sum of US$642,451.04 (being the equivalent

of $1,368,420.70 at the exchange rate of S$2.13 to US$1). Mr Liu claimed that thereafter he asked Mr

Tan for payment of the balance of the purchase price, but no payment was made by the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    About two years later, on 25 August 1983, a Hong Kong

company owned by Mr Tan and his wife, Madam Ching, called Fook Gee Finance Ltd (Fook Gee),

commenced an action in Suit No 4141 of 1983 (the 1983 action) against Mr Liu, claiming the sum

of US$642,451.04 as a loan which, it was alleged, had been advanced to Mr Liu and seeking the

repayment of that amount. Mr Liu resisted the claim. His defence was that there was no loan made to

him by Fook Gee, and that the amount was part payment of the purchase price made by Mr Tan for Madam

Lims interest in the Property which Mr Tan had agreed to purchase at the price of $3.8 m net

of tax.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    About a year after Fook Gee had commenced the action, Madam

Lim commenced an action in Suit No. 4149 of 1984 (the 1984 action) against Lee Tat, Mr Tan and

Lee Kai, claiming, inter alia, the balance of the purchase price. She subsequently joined Collin as

the fourth defendant. The defence put forward on behalf of the defendants was essentially that Madam

Lim never had any interest in the Property. Mr Tan died before the action came on for trial and

Madam Ching was appointed to represent his estate.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    Both the actions, were tried together before Lai Siu Chiu

J, as the events and the evidence were inextricably linked. The judge found that there was no

evidence that the sum of US$642,451.04 was a loan by Fook Gee to Mr Liu, and that the sum came from

the funds of a Liberian import and export company called Komala Deccoff &amp; Co SA, which was owned

by Mr Tan and another person. She therefore dismissed Fook Gees claim in the 1983 action. Turning

to the claim of Madam Lim in the 1984 action, the judge found that Madam Lim did have an interest in

the Property, that Mr Tan had agreed to buy that interest at the price of $3.8 m, and that the sum

of US$642,451.04 paid to Mr Liu was a part payment of the purchase price. She therefore entered

judgment in her favour but only against Lee Tat for the balance sum, being the difference between

the purchase price of $3.8 m and the sum of $1,368,420.70 (being the equivalent of US$642,451.04 at

the exchange rate of S$2.13 to US$1) that had already been paid.</p>
<p align="justify">12.    Against her decision, Lee Tat, Madam Ching representing the

estate of Mr Tan and Lee Kai as well as Fook Gee appealed to this Court by two separate appeals.

Both the appeals were heard together. This Court dismissed Fook Gees appeal and affirmed the

decision below in the 1983 action. However, this Court allowed the appeal by Lee Tat, Madam Ching

representing the estate of Mr Tan and Lee Kai, and set aside the judgement in the 1984 action. The

Court held that Madam Lim had not established that she had any interest in the Property and thus

dismissed her claim in the 1984 action: see <i>Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit and another

action </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45552&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 121</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">13.    As a sequel to the decision of this Court, Madam Ching, as

the executrix of Mr Tans estate, on 4 June 1998, commenced the present proceedings in Suit No 862

of 1998 against Mr Liu seeking to recover the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent of

US$642,451.04 at the agreed rate of exchange at the time of payment to Mr Liu) as money had and

received, on the ground that the US$642,451.04 was paid to Mr Liu under a mistaken assumption that

Madam Lim had an interest in the Property, and/or that the consideration for the sum of

US$642,451.04 had totally failed.</p>
<p align="justify">14.    After the close of pleadings, Mr Liu applied to strike out

the statement of claim on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of

process, or alternatively on the ground that the claim was time barred. Upon being served with the

application to strike out, Madam Ching applied to have the statement of claim amended by the

addition of an alternative claim for a constructive trust. Both the applications were heard before

the assistant registrar, who dismissed Madam Chings application to amend the statement of claim

and allowed Mr Lius application to strike out the statement of claim. The assistant registrar

held that the claim was time barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 ed), and that the

facts did not give rise to any constructive trust. Against the decision of the assistant registrar,

Madam Ching appealed to a Judge in Chambers and the appeal was dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    On further appeal, this Court allowed both the appeals, i.e<i>.</i>

the appeal against the striking out of the statement of claim and the appeal against the refusal to

allow the amendment: see <i>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee deceased) v Liu

Cho Chit &amp; another</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50779&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 517</a>. Hence, the action proceeded to trial. The trial judge

at the conclusion of the hearing dismissed Madam Chings claim. Against that decision this appeal

was brought.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">16.    The issues canvassed before us were the same as those

raised and decided below, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) whether the proper parties were before the court;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) whether Madam Chings claim for the sum of $1,368,420.71 was time barred

  by the Limitation Act; and</p>
<p align="justify">(3) whether a remedial constructive trust arose on the facts of this case.</p>
<b><i>
</i></b></blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The proper parties</p>
<p align="justify">17.    One of the defences raised by Mr Liu in the pleadings was

that the proper parties were not before the court. First, Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate

of Mr Tan was not the proper plaintiff. The reason for this was that it was established in the 1983

action that the monies paid to Mr Liu came from a company, Komala Decoff SA, and therefore the

monies belonged to that company and accordingly that company should be the plaintiff. Secondly, Mr

Liu was not the proper defendant. Here, the reason was that in the 1984 action, the judge found that

Madam Lim had entered into an agreement, through Mr Liu, to sell her interest in the Property and

that Mr Liu was only the agent for Madam Lim, and therefore the proper defendant should be Madam Lim

and not Mr Liu.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    On this issue, the judge held that the correct plaintiff

should be Lee Tat and that the correct defendant should be Madam Lim. The basis for this conclusion

was that the parties to the underlying agreement for the sale of Madam Lims alleged interest were

Madam Lim and Lee Tat. The judge approached the issue thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">34 As regards the question as to who the correct plaintiff should be, I am of

  the view that the material point is not where the monies came from or who paid the monies or who

  the monies belonged to. The material point is who the contracting parties were. This would also be

  the correct approach on the question as to who the correct defendant should be.</p>
<p align="justify">35 For example, if X enters into a contract with Y to buy Ys interest in a

  property and monies are paid pursuant to that contract to purchase Ys interest, it is

  irrelevant as between X and Y whether the money came from Xs parents or a family company or a

  financial institution. It is also irrelevant whether Y received the monies personally or not. X is

  the correct person to sue and Y is the correct person to be sued if there is a total failure of

  consideration on Ys part or if the payment was made pursuant to a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The judge then turned to what was found in the 1983 and 1984 actions by the High

Court, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">36 As I have mentioned, in the 1983 and 1984 actions, the trial judge had

  found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) that the monies were paid as part payment of Mdm Lims interest in the

    Property pursuant to an agreement in April 1981 which Mdm Lim had entered, through Liu, to sell

    her interest to Lee Tat, and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) that Mdm Lim had acquired an interest in the Property and therefore there

    was something for her to sell. Accordingly the trial judge had ordered Lee Tat, and only Lee

    Tat, to pay the balance of the purchase price to Mdm Lim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">37 When the Court of Appeal reversed the trial judges decision, it was only

  on the basis that Mdm Lim had not established that she had, or had acquired, an interest in the

  Property.</p>
<p align="justify">38 The Court of Appeal did not disturb the other findings of the trial judge in

  the 1983 and 1984 actions, i.e. that the purchaser was Lee Tat and the vendor was Mdm Lim.</p>
<p align="justify">39 Accordingly, as regards the causes of action based on mistake of fact and

  total failure of consideration, and monies had and received, I am of the view that in the light of

  the findings of the trial judge in the 1983 and 1984 actions, the claims before me should have

  been made by Lee Tat against Mdm Lim and not by Mdm Ching, as executrix of Tans estate, against

  Liu.</p>
<p align="justify">40 As for the cause of action based on a remedial constructive trust, I am of

  the view that even though Liu had received the monies, the findings of the trial judge in the 1983

  and the 1984 actions would also mean that Liu had received the monies on behalf of Mdm Lim.

  Whether he had parted with the monies to Mdm Lim is a matter between them. It would then follow

  that it is Mdm Lim, not Liu, who is to account as trustee for the monies even if I should find

  that the Plaintiff has established a remedial constructive trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.    Before us, Mr Michael Khoo, counsel for Madam Ching, argued

that the approach of the judge ignored the fact that the true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr

Liu, which was accepted by Mr Liu in his evidence. On a true analysis of the facts, so far as Mr Liu

was concerned, Madam Lim was his nominee, and the interest in the Property which he thought had been

acquired was his but held by Madam Lim as his nominee. In the negotiation with Mr Tan, Mr Liu acted

in his personal capacity as the beneficial owner. As for Mr Tan, he also negotiated with Mr Liu as

the true owner of the Property and not as the agent for Lee Tat. The negotiations were conducted

only between Mr Tan and Mr Liu and the agreement was reached between them as the contracting

parties, and the moneys were handed by Mr Tan to Mr Liu. Mr Khoo thus contended that the money

should be recovered from Mr Liu, not Madam Lim, and the action was properly brought by Madam Ching,

as the executrix of the estate of Mr Tan, against Mr Liu.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    On the other hand, Mr C R Rajah, counsel for Mr Liu, argued

that the claim brought by Madam Ching against Mr Liu was for the return of some $1.3 m paid by

mistake as part of the purchase price under a contract for the purchase of an interest in the

Property, which the vendor did not have. The contract was made between Mr Liu on behalf of his wife,

as the vendor and Mr Tan on behalf of Lee Tat as the purchaser. If this sum had to be returned, it

would be by the vendor, Madam Lim, to the purchaser, Lee Tat. On this point, Mr Rajah relied on what

transpired in the 1983 and 1984 actions and what the High Court found in those actions. He thus

maintained that the proper plaintiff should be Lee Tat and the proper defendant Madam Lim.</p>
<p align="justify">21.    We were unable to agree with Mr Rajah. It should be borne

in mind that, in the 1984 action, before the High Court and on appeal before this Court, the

question as to the proper parties for the recovery of the sum of $1,368,420.71 (being the equivalent

of US$642,451.01) was not in issue. The main issue there was whether Madam Lim had an interest in

the Property. The High Court held that she had, but on appeal this Court found that she had not

established that she had such interest. As Mr Khoo rightly pointed out, both the High Court and this

Court, at times in the course of the respective judgments, dealt with the alleged interest in the

Property as interchangeably that of Mr Liu and Madam Lim. Certainly this Court did not make any

clear distinction between the two.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    <font face="Times New Roman">On the facts, there was no

doubt that both in the joint venture agreements made in January 1973 and in the sale of the alleged

interest in the Property in April 1981, the true contracting parties were Mr Tan and Mr Liu and

nobody else. In respect of the joint venture, Mr Tan and Mr Liu were the ones who negotiated with

each other and reached an agreement, which was then reduced into four separate agreements. So far as

Mr Liu was concerned, his wife, Madam Lim, was merely his nominee. In entering into the joint

venture with Mr Tan in 1973, he made use of his wife as a nominal party to the joint venture

agreements and signed the agreements on her behalf. She did not even know of the joint venture or of

any of the agreements which were made in her name. The same applies to Mr Tan with regard to using

his daughter, Collin, and his family company, Lee Kai, in entering into the joint venture

agreements. Mr Tan signed the agreements on behalf of Collin and Lee Kai respectively. Like Madam

Lim, Collin did not even know of the joint venture or any of the joint venture agreements. In truth

and in fact, Mr Liu and Mr Tan were the contracting parties. As Mr Khoo submitted, and we agreed,

none of the nominal parties to the joint venture agreements had any independent thought or action as

regards any of the agreements. Further, the subsequent dealings in relation to the proposed

development on the joint venture site were between Mr Tan and Mr Liu only.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    Subsequently, in April 1981, when Mr Liu and Mr Tan

negotiated on the sale and purchase of what was then believed to be Madam Lims or Mr Lius

interest in the Property, only Mr Liu and Mr Tan were the parties involved in such negotiations. So

far as Mr Liu was concerned, his wife was the nominee and the interest acquired was his, and in the

negotiations he was acting in his personal capacity as the beneficial owner of that interest. The

evidence of Mr Liu was that he negotiated with Mr Tan on the sale of that interest, and they reached

an agreement, whereby Mr Tan agreed to purchase that interest at the price of $3.8 m, and in part

payment of the purchase price, Mr Tan handed to him the two cashiers orders for the total amount

of US$642,451.04. It was Mr Tan who made the payment. Where he got the funds from was immaterial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    Even if it can be said, as it was so argued on behalf of Mr

Liu, that Madam Lim was the contracting party and that the sum of US$642,451.01 was a purported part

payment, through Mr Liu, to Madam Lim of what was then believed to be her interest in the Property,

and thus the payment was made to Mr Liu as the agent for Madam Lim, an action could still be

brought, as was brought here, to recover that sum from him. He was the sole recipient and

beneficiary of this sum, and the irrefutable evidence was that no part of that sum was ever paid to

Madam Lim. He had kept this sum and treated it as his. He could properly be sued, as he was here,

for repayment of the money that was paid to him. There is authority for the proposition that, where

a payer makes a payment to an agent of the payee under a mistake of fact, the payer can recover the

payment from the agent, if the agent has not paid it over to the principal: <i>Kleinwort, Sons &amp;

Co v Dunlop Rubber Co </i>(1907) 97 LT 263, at 264 and 265. See also Goff and Jones, <i>The Law of

Restitution </i>(5<sup>th</sup> edn) (1998) at pp 186 and 833.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    Turning to Mr Tan, it was not in evidence that Mr Tan on

behalf of Lee Tat entered into the sale and purchase agreement with Mr Liu; there was only an

inference that he probably did so, because the Property was then vested in Lee Tat. The undisputed

evidence was that it was Mr Tan who negotiated with Mr Liu for the purchase of the alleged interest

of Madam Lim or Mr Liu in the Property, that it was Mr Tan who agreed with Mr Liu on the price for

the alleged interest, and that it was Mr Tan who paid the monies to Mr Liu. The monies were clearly

his, and there was no evidence that the monies were Lee Tats. In any case, Lee Tat was his

nominee and his company, and to all intents and purposes the Property was his. There was nothing to

prevent him, on his own account, from purchasing what he believed was Madam Lims or Mr Lius

interest in the Property and made the part payment. Even if, acting as an agent of Lee Tat, he made

the payment to Mr Liu, he did so in the mistaken belief that Madam Lim or Mr Liu had an interest in

the Property, which in fact neither of them had. In such circumstances, that mistake was entirely

his and not his principals; nor could it be attributed to his principal, and he can recover the

monies from the payee: see Goff and Jones, <i>The Law of Restitution</i> (5<sup>th</sup> edn) (1998)

at pp 183  184.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    In our judgment, Madam Ching as the executrix of the estate

of Mr Tan, was entitled to bring this action against Mr Liu for the recovery of the sum paid to him.

The proper parties were before the court. On this point, with respect, we were unable to agree with

the judge below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Periods of limitation</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    With respect to Madam Chings claim for money had and

received for a total failure of consideration, the judge held that the cause of action was founded

on contract, and s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) applied. As the money was paid to Mr Liu

on or about 23 April 1981, the claim for the recovery of this sum had been barred by 22 April 1987.

He said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">72 I am of the view that such causes of action are founded on a contract for

  the purpose of s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">6 - (1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after

    the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort; </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">73 The monies which are the subject of this action were paid pursuant to the

  oral contract to purchase Mdm Lims interest. The claim for monies had and received are also

  founded on the oral contract in that it was not as though the monies were received on a basis

  apart from the oral contract. In addition, the words founded on a contract are wide enough

  to cover claims for the recovery of monies paid pursuant to a contract where the underlying

  subject matter of the agreement did not exist or did not materialise.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">76 Accordingly these causes of action would be time-barred long before the

  commencement of the present action on 4 June 1998.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The judges reasoning on this point was, with respect, correct. We agree with

him entirely.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    We now turn to the claim for recovery of the monies on the

ground that the payment was made under a mistake. If the monies were paid under a mistake, then the

limitation period for Madam Lims action would have been postponed under s 29(1)(c) of the

Limitation Act. The provision states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">29(1) Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is

  prescribed by this Act </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">(c) the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake, the period of

  limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake, as

  the case may be, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    It was Mr Khoos contention that payment of the

US$642,451.04 was made under a mistake of law, and that this mistake could not have been discovered

until this Court delivered its decision on 6 February 1998. He thus argued that the present

proceedings, which were commenced in 1998, were not time barred. This argument was rejected by the

judge below. We too rejected it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.    There was ample evidence before the court that Mr Tan

discovered the mistake long before the judgment of this Court was delivered. The judge laid out the

evidence as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">93 By a letter dated 4 May 1983, M/s Drew &amp; Napier, acting for Fook Gee,

  demanded the return of the monies paid and interest from Liu on the basis that Fook Gee had lent

  the monies to Liu.</p>
<p align="justify">94 By a letter dated 11 May 1983, M/s Allen Yau, acting for Liu, replied. They

  said that Liu had received on behalf of Mdm Lim the monies from Lee Tat. They also said that the

  monies represented part payment of a purchase price for Mdm Lims interest in the Property.</p>
<p align="justify">95 By a letter dated 27 July 1983, M/s Drew &amp; Napier asserted that Mdm Lim

  never had any direct interest in the land.</p>
<p align="justify">96 M/s Drew &amp; Napier must have been taking instructions from Tan as Tan was

  controlling Fook Gee and Lee Tat.</p>
<p align="justify">97 Lee Tats and Tans position was reiterated in paragraph 12 of the

  Amended Defence (of the first three defendants), filed on 7 October 1987, in the 1984 action,

  which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">12. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim are denied. Further the

    Statement of Claim discloses no share which the Plaintiff owned at the said date which she could

    agree to sell. The Defendants reserve the right to plead further hereto when the case is

    properly particularised.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Apart from the pleadings filed in that action, Mr Tan himself asserted in his

affidavit filed on 1 February 1989 that Madam Lim had no interest in the Property. Thus, as of that

date, if not earlier, he had already discovered the mistake. That was the most damning piece of

evidence against the claim that the mistake was not discovered until the decision of this Court. The

judge referred to Mr Tans affidavit and said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">99 Furthermore, paragraph 20(iii) of Tans affidavit affirmed on 1 February

  1989 for the 1984 action stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(20) In June 1984, 11 years after the alleged Second Agreement was

    purportedly entered into, the Plaintiff commenced this action to claim the following relief:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) as against the 1st Defendants and/or myself, she claims specific

      performance of a purported oral agreement made sometime in April 1981, under which the 1st

      Defendants and/or myself allegedly agreed to buy her share in Lot 1606 of Mukim 28 for $3.8

      million (hereinafter called "the alleged oral Third Agreement").</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">100 Paragraphs 25(a) and 27 to 29 of the same affidavit stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(25) The Plaintiffs claim that the 1st Defendants are holding Lot 1606 of

    Mukim 28 on trust for her and Collin Tan is also misconceived and cannot be sustained for the

    following reasons:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) At all material times, the Plaintiff had <i>no proprietory interest in

      the property</i>;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) </p>
<p align="justify">(c) </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(26) </p>
<p align="justify">(27) Further, for any or all of the above reasons, the Plaintiff had <i>no

    interest in the property</i> and, consequently, nothing for which she could allegedly sell to

    the 1st Defendants or myself.</p>
<p align="justify">(28) Besides, the 1st Defendants were at all material times the de facto and

    de jure owner of the property (including Lot 1606 of Mukim 28). Even if the alleged oral Third

    Agreement existed, which is denied, there was no consideration to support it.</p>
<p align="justify">(29)  At the time of the alleged oral Third Agreement, she had no right

    whatsoever in the property. For this reason, the alleged oral Third Agreement is invalid for

    want of consideration. [Emphasis is added]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In view of what had transpired, it was impossible to argue on behalf of Madam

Ching that Mr Tan could not have known about Madam Lims want of interest until this Courts

decision. At the latest, Mr Tan knew about it by 1 February 1989, when he affirmed the affidavit.

Even if the limitation period was postponed by virtue of s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, the time

bar would have set in by 1 February 1995, at the latest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.    The following argument was, nevertheless, raised by Mr Khoo

on behalf of Madam Ching in the Appellants Case:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">86. It was held by the Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln County Council</i>

  that the date when the local authority interest swap rate transactions proved to be void was when

  the House of Lords made its decision in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</i>.

  It is submitted that it is implicit if not express in that judgment that the cause of action to

  recover a payment made under a mistake of law only accrues when the court determines that there is

  a mistake of law.</p>
<p align="justify">..</p>
<p align="justify">89. Therefore it was not until the Court of Appeal judgment of 6<sup>th</sup>

  February 1998 that it was established that there had been a mistake in 1981 when the moneys were

  paid over to the respondent. The mistake was therefore not "discovered" until the Court

  of Appeal held that Mdm Lim/the respondents assumed interest was not an interest at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.    We were unable to accept this argument. The provision in

question is s 29(1)(c) of the Limitation Act, which states quite clearly that time begins to

run once the plaintiff could with reasonable diligence have discovered the mistake. As far as

s 29(1)(c) is concerned, it is the plaintiffs means of ascertaining the mistake, and not what the

court eventually decides, that is relevant in determining when the limitation period begins to run.

While the fact that Madam Lim (or Mr Liu) had no interest in the Property was determined only after

this Courts decision on 6 February 1998, Mr Tan obviously knew about the true state of affairs

long before that date. In fact, he had already discovered the mistake by the time he affirmed his

affidavit on 1 February 1989. In these circumstances, it was impossible to maintain that Mr Tan <i>could

not with reasonable diligence</i> have discovered that Madam Lim (or Mr Liu) had no interest in the

Property until only after the decision of this Court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Remedial constructive trust</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.    Mr Khoo finally argued that the court should impose a

constructive trust on the sum of US$642,451.01 paid to Mr Liu. His argument was along the following

line. The money was paid to Mr Liu under a mistake, and although the mere receipt of the money in

ignorance of the mistake did not give rise to a trust in favour of Mr Tan at that time, the

retention of the money by Mr Liu after he discovered the mistake, i.e. after this Court had

delivered its decision, gave rise to a constructive trust, because thenceforward his conscience was

affected by the fact that the monies received by him had been paid for no consideration or under a

mistake. It was the continued retention of such monies by Mr Liu that gave rise to this remedial

constructive trust, which the court should now impose, requiring Mr Liu to return the money to Mr

Tan. Mr Khoo then invoked s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, which provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a

  beneficiary under a trust, being an action </p>
<p align="justify">. . . . .</p>
<p align="justify">(b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the

  possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.    A remedial constructive trust arises where the court

imposes a constructive trust de novo on assets which are not subject to any pre-existing trust as a

means of granting equitable relief in a case where it considers just that restitution should be made

(per Slade LJ in <i>Metal Und Rohstoff A G v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenerette Inc and Anor</i>

[1990] 1 QB 391, 478. Slade LJ, however, said (at p 479) that the extent to which a constructive can

properly be treated as a remedy is far from clearly defined in the authorities, and said at the end

of p 479:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">While we have had the benefit of very full argument on almost all other aspects

  of the law involved in this case, we have neither heard nor invited comprehensive argument as to

  the circumstances in which the court will be prepared to impose a constructive trust de novo as a

  foundation for the grant of equitable remedy by way of account or otherwise. Nevertheless, we are

  satisfied that there is a good arguable case that such circumstances may arise and, for want of a

  better description, will refer to a constructive trust of this nature as a "remedial

  constructive" trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.    Mr Khoo relied on certain dicta of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in

<i>Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale v Islington London Borough County Council</i> [1996] AC

669. In that case, a bank in June 1987 entered into a swap contract with a local authority,

and pursuant to that contract paid certain sums to the local authority. As a result of the decision

of the House of Lords in <i>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fullam London Borough Council</i> [1992] 2 AC

1, such a contract was ultra vires the authorities and therefore void. The bank therefore sought the

recovery of the sums from the local authority it had paid together with compound interest and

succeeded before the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. The local authority appealed to the House

of Lords and one of the questions for consideration was whether the bank could get compound interest

on the sums recovered from the authority. As the general rule was that, in the absence of fraud,

equity would not award compound interest except against trustees or other persons in a fiduciary

position in respect of profits improperly made, the bank sought to argue that the sums received by

the authority were held on trust for the bank. This argument was rejected and it was held, inter

alia, that a recipient of monies under a contract subsequently declared void or as being ultra vires

does not hold those monies on a resulting trust and that equity would not award the bank compound

interest in aid of their common law claim of restitution. In the course of his speech, Lord

Browne-Wilkinson discussed the possibility of a remedial constructive trust being available and

distinguished the remedial constructive trust from the normal institutional constructive trust as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Under an institutional constructive trust, the trust arises by operation of law

  as from the date of the circumstances which give rise to it: the function of the court is merely

  to declare that such trust has arisen in the past. The consequences that flow from such trust have

  arisen (including the possibly unfair consequences to third parties who in the interim have

  received the trust property) are also determined by rules of law, not under a discretion. A

  remedial constructive trust, as I understand it, is different. It is a judicial remedy giving rise

  to an enforceable equitable obligation: the extent to which it operates retrospectively to the

  prejudice of third parties lies in the discretion of the court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">And later at p 716 his Lordship said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Although the resulting trust is an unsuitable basis for developing proprietary

  restitutionary remedies, the remedial constructive trust, if introduced into English law, may

  provide a more satisfactory road forward. The court by way of remedy might impose a constructive

  trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly

  deprived. Since the remedy can be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case, innocent

  third parties would not be prejudiced and restitutionary defences, such as change of position, are

  capable of being given effect. However, whether English law should follow the United States and

  Canada by adopting the remedial constructive trust will have to be decided in some future case

  when the point is directly in issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.    Reverting to the case at hand, the judge below held that

even if remedial constructive trust applies in Singapore, no remedial constructive trust arose in

this case. He said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">141  I am satisfied that on the particular facts before me, the Plaintiff

  has failed to establish such a trust.</p>
<p align="justify">142 The Plaintiffs case was that the payment was made pursuant to a contract

  of sale of Mdm Lims interest. The Court of Appeal has found that Mdm Lim did not have such an

  interest.</p>
<p align="justify">143 The Plaintiff is in no better position than the depositors in <i>Sinclair v

  Brougham</i> where the monies were paid pursuant to a void contract.</p>
<p align="justify">144 As in that case, when the monies were paid to purchase Mdm Lims

  interest, it was intended that she should be free to deal with the monies and she was entitled to

  mix the monies with other monies of hers or anyone else for that matter. Whether it was in fact

  mixed is irrelevant.</p>
<p align="justify">145 The Plaintiffs cause of action is one based on a total failure of

  consideration and not trust. Mdm Lim has been unjustly enriched and was accountable for the monies

  received but the relationship was exclusively commercial and the monies were and are not trust

  property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">We agree with these observations of the judge. A remedial constructive trust is a

restitutionary remedy which the court, in appropriate circumstances, gives by way of equitable

relief. In order for a remedial constructive trust to arise, the payees conscience must have been

affected, while the monies in question still remain with him. If, as was the situation in the <i>Westdeutsche</i>

case, the payee learns of the mistake only after the monies have got mixed with other funds or

dissipated, no constructive trust in respect of these monies can arise. This is because there would

no longer be an identifiable fund for the trust to bite. It is significant to note that the

plaintiff bank in the <i>Westdeutsche</i> case expressly disavowed any intention of pursing a claim

in constructive trust. The reason for their not having done so was stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson

at p 707:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">This is not a case where the bank had any equitable interest which pre-dated

  receipt by the local authority of the upfront payment. Therefore, in order to show that the local

  authority became a trustee, the bank must demonstrate circumstances which raised a trust for the

  first time either at the date on which the local authority received the money or at the date on

  which payment into the mixed account was made. <i>Counsel for the bank specifically disavowed any

  claim based on a constructive trust. This was plainly right because the local authority had no

  relevant knowledge sufficient to raise a constructive trust at any time before the moneys, upon

  the bank account going into overdraft, became untraceable. Once there ceased to be an identifiable

  trust fund, the local authority could not become a trustee</i>: <i>In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd.</i>

  [1995] 1 A.C. 74. Therefore, as the argument for the bank recognised, the only possible trust

  which could be established was a resulting trust arising from the circumstances in which the local

  authority received the upfront payment. [Emphasis is added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.    Turning to the facts of this case, we found that there was

no ground for imposing a remedial constructive trust on Mr Liu in respect of the sum US$642,451.01

paid to him. The relationship between Mr Liu and Mr Tan was only that of a vendor and purchaser and

was wholly commercial. There was no dishonest conduct on the part of Mr Liu The sum was paid to Mr

Liu in April 1981 with the intent that he was free to deal with it as his money. It was never

intended by either Mr Tan or Mr Liu that it should be kept, and it had never been kept, distinct as

an identifiable fund. On the basis of Mr Khoos contention that Mr Liu discovered the mistake only

in February 1998 or thereabouts, there was a span of some 17 years and the sum paid to Mr Liu must

have, in the meanwhile, been spent or mixed with other funds of Mr Liu. There was no sum or fund on

which a remedy of constructive trust could be imposed by the court. The sum paid to Mr Liu was

certainly not trust property. There was, of course, an obligation on the part of Mr Liu to return

the monies to Mr Tan, but that was only a personal obligation. In our judgment, no remedial

constructive trust could and should be imposed on the facts of this case.</p>
