</div> The evidence sought to be adduced by the Defendants could have been obtained earlier with reasonable diligence. Even if this factor was disregarded, the main difficulty with SUM 2639 was that the evidence in the third defendant’s second affidavit was neither relevant nor credible. It did not have an important influence on the appeal.

</div> Questions concerning whether the plaintiff had coerced the Defendants into selling the Property and the plaintiff’s entitlement to lodge a caveat in respect of the Property were plainly irrelevant to this dispute.

As mentioned above at [19], the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment in SUM 601 was brought solely in relation to its primary claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: What effect the Defendants’ counterclaim should have on an order for summary judgment  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid Pte Ltd v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden) </span>[2018] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid</span>”) at [97]–[98], the High Court set out a practical framework to guide the court’s determination on when summary judgment ought to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim. In brief, the recommended framework comprises four steps:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Step 1: whether the counterclaim is plausible – this involves the court considering whether it is reasonably possible for the counterclaim to succeed at trial. If the counterclaim is not plausible, then its presence ought not to stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment of its whole claim, without any stay pending the determination of the counterclaim, and the court should so rule. If the court finds that the counterclaim is plausible, then Step 2 follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Step 2: whether the plausible counterclaim amounts to a defence of set-off – this involves the court determining whether the counterclaim that it has found to be plausible amounts to a defence of set-off, whether legal or equitable. If it is so found, then unconditional leave to defend should be granted in respect of the whole of the claim. On the other hand, if the counterclaim does not amount to a defence of set-off, then the court may proceed to Step 3.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Step 3: whether the plausible counterclaim is sufficiently connected to the claim – this involves the court considering whether there is a connection between the claim (for which summary judgment is sought) and the counterclaim which it has considered to be plausible. If there is no connection between the claim and the counterclaim, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, the court should generally grant summary judgment of the whole claim, without a stay pending the determination of the unconnected counterclaim. If the court is satisfied of the degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, it may proceed to Step 4.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Step 4: whether there are grounds for a stay of execution in the light of the connected and plausible counterclaim – this involves the court examining, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, the degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, the strength and quantum of the counterclaim and the ability of the plaintiff to satisfy any judgment on the counterclaim. The exercise of the discretion to grant or to refuse to grant a stay of execution of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum pending trial of a plausible and connected counterclaim will ultimately depend on whether the defendant is able to show that it would be fair and just in all the circumstances of the case to stay the immediate enforcement of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum due to the pending trial of the counterclaim. In this regard, the burden lies on the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the present action, the Defendants’ counterclaim comprises the following three claims (collectively the “Counterclaim”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Claim for loss and damage arising from the plaintiff’s deliberate act of banking in five of the post-dated Cheques at the same time on 17 January 2022 (despite the first defendant’s instructions not to do so), which resulted in the first defendant’s access to its UOB account being blocked by the bank (“the First Counterclaim”).

First, there was no evidential basis to support the Defendants’ assertion of any such purported drop in revenue. Second, it was unclear how the plaintiff’s staff had harassed the second and third defendants at the first defendant’s premises. Third, in any event, it was clear that the first defendant’s business losses could not be solely attributed (if at all) to the plaintiff’s employees purported harassment of the first defendant and its staff. Indeed, as the Defendants conceded, the COVID-19 pandemic had caused the first defendant business difficulties.

The Defendants attributed the cause of the collapse of the first defendant’s business to the presentation of five of the Cheques which led to the freezing of its UOB bank account resulting in estimated losses of $100m. However, it was only a bare assertion that the bank had frozen the first defendant’s bank account after the cheques were presented. Moreover, it was the first defendant’s own evidence that it had suffered losses due to the challenging operating environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

</div> This forecast document indicated that the first defendant was “[t]argeting quantum leap in sales revenues to $100 million annually within the next 3 years” and that it was “poised to register [a revenue] of S$100 million in … FY2024”.

</div> It is relevant to point out that a projected revenue of $100m does <span class="font-italic">not</span> equate to profits earned of $100m as the figure does not include expenses. Therefore, the amount of the alleged loss sustained was plainly inaccurate. In any event, I did not accord much weight, if any, to this forecast document as it was highly speculative and based solely on the first defendant’s own internal projections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In summary, as the First Counterclaim was both factually and legally unsustainable, I was of the view that there was ample basis for AR Liew’s decision to strike it out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my assessment, in RA 187, the plaintiff had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment on its primary claim and the Defendants did not raise a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence to answer the claim. Neither did the Defendants demonstrate any other reason why there ought to be a trial of the primary claim. The Defendants’ Counterclaim was not plausible for the purpose of the summary judgment proceedings and accordingly I affirmed AR Tang’s decision to grant summary judgment of the plaintiff’s primary claim and dismissed the appeal. Consequently, I awarded the costs of the appeal to the plaintiff at $8,000 including disbursements for RA 187.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In respect of RA 282, I was satisfied that: (a) in respect of the second and third defendants, the D&amp;CC disclosed no reasonable cause of action on their part against the plaintiff; and (b) the First Counterclaim brought by the first defendant was clearly factually and legally unsustainable. I thus affirmed AR Liew’s decision and dismissed the appeal. I awarded the costs of the appeal to the plaintiff at $6,000 including disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tong Chuan (Excelsior Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tean (Carson Law Chambers) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
