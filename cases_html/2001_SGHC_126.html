<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns=""><b><i>
<p align="justify">Background to my decision</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">1.    In Originating Summons No 600044 of 2001, Newspeed
International Limited (‘Newspeed’) had sought leave to enforce an arbitration
award dated 16 August 2000 against Citus Trading Pte Ltd (‘Citus’).</p>
<p align="justify">2.    By an Order of Court dated 19 February 2001, such
leave was granted.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    Citus then applied in Summons-in-Chambers No
600563 of 2001 to set aside the Order granting leave to enforce.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    After hearing arguments, including arguments on
interlocutory matters, I dismissed Citus’ application with costs. Citus have appealed
against this decision.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><i>
<p align="justify">Background to Citus’ application</p>
</i></b>
<p align="justify">5.    Newspeed had entered into a contract No CT/NS/001
dated 2 November 1998 (‘the Citus Agreement’) with Citus for Newspeed to buy
from Citus 7,000 cubic metres (allowing 10% increase and decrease) of Indonesian Merbau
Round Logs (‘the Logs’).</p>
<p align="justify">6.    Newspeed in turn re-sold the Logs to China Timber
Import/Export Company under contract number NSL/35 (‘the China Timber
Agreement’).</p>
<p align="justify">7.    Newspeed made a claim against Citus for
short-delivery and defective quality. They relied on a survey report prepared by Guangdong
Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau of the People’s Republic of China
(‘GIEC’).</p>
<p align="justify">8.    Citus’ position was that a log list had been
provided with the Citus Agreement which described the Logs and explained defects in the
Logs. After taking into account those that were defective, the price was adjusted
accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    Citus said that after they received the GIEC
report, they sent their graders accompanied by graders from their Indonesian suppliers to
Huangpu port where the Logs had been delivered.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    Their graders, the Indonesian graders and graders
from the port spent a week and came up with their own log list i.e a second log list.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    Also the GIEC report referred to the China Timber
Agreement instead of the Citus Agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">12.    The dispute was referred to arbitration under the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (‘CIETAC’) in
accordance with the terms of the Citus Agreement. Three arbitrators were appointed.</p>
<p align="justify">13.    According to Citus they had asked for the China
Timber Agreement to be produced and various information from the start of the arbitral
hearing. One of the documents they had also sought was the log sheet of the GIEC which
should be attached to their report.</p>
<p align="justify">14.    The hearing of the arbitration tribunal took
place on 11 January 2000 and lasted no more than 90 minutes.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    According to the allegations of Citus or
documents exhibited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Subsequent to the hearing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Citus had filed an Opinion dated 28 January 2000, and</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Newspeed had filed an Opinion, received by CIETAC on 2 February
    2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) CIETAC had issued a letter dated 18 February 2000 that all opinions
  and evidence are to be submitted by the final deadline of 10 March 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Both Citus and Newspeed filed further opinions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Opinion filed by Citus dated 29 February 2000</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Opinion filed by Newspeed and received by CIETAC on 8 March 2000</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Opinion filed by Citus dated 24 March 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(d) CIETAC replied on 30 March 2000 that since the last Opinion filed
  by Citus was after the deadline of 10 March 2000, CIETAC may not accept it. I note that
  the translated version states that the arbitration tribunal will decide whether to accept
  the evidence submitted by Citus. Citus’ position was that the last Opinion filed by
  it did not forward any new document or evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) On or around 28 April 2000, Newspeed wrote to the arbitral tribunal
  to explain the GIEC report and to forward for the first time, inter alia, the China Timber
  Agreement. Citus alleged that the authenticity of the China Timber Agreement was open to
  question for various reasons but it is not necessary for me to state them. Also the China
  Timber Agreement did not have the log list that should have accompanied this agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">(f) Citus alleged that despite the deadline of 10 March 2000 and
  CIETAC’s letter of 30 March 2000, CIETAC was prepared to accept Newspeed’s new
  evidence without question as CIETAC simply forwarded Newspeed’s explanation to Citus
  and asked them to check it.</p>
<p align="justify">(g) Citus alleged that Citus wrote to CIETAC on 17 May 2000 stating
  that the China Timber Agreement and related documents submitted constituted new evidence
  and sought leave for a sitting for cross-examination to be conducted. I noted that the
  translated version only states that Citus hoped that the arbitral tribunal will first
  examine and verify the new evidence (from Newspeed) before the tribunal decides whether to
  accept it.</p>
<p align="justify">(h) On 16 August 2000 Citus wrote to request an extension of the
  arbitration term and a second sitting because Citus had important evidence to submit and
  had questions about the evidence last submitted by Newspeed.</p>
<p align="justify">(i) From the documentary evidence, it seems that this letter dated 16
  August 2000 was received by CIETAC on 23 August 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(j) On 24 August 2000, Citus sought again for the arbitration to be
  extended for another hearing. In this letter, the intention to cross-examine was mentioned
  for the first time.</p>
<p align="justify">(k) Very soon ‘thereafter’, CIETAC forwarded an arbitration
  award dated 16 August 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(l) Citus then appealed to a court in Beijing on 21 September 2000. Mr
  Yang Lih Shyng, for Newspeed, said this was the Intermediate People’s Court. The
  appeal was dismissed on 30 October 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The correspondence with CIETAC was usually done by lawyers.</p>
<p align="justify">16.    In summary, Citus’ position was that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) They had not been given the opportunity to challenge the China
  Timber Agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The China Timber Agreement did not attach the log list that
  accompanied the agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Furthermore, even if the China Timber Agreement was bona fide, it
  showed that Newspeed made no loss and there was no evidence of any claim against Newspeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">17.    Citus then applied to set aside the (Singapore)
Order granting leave to enforce the award. Its application did not identify the specific
provision of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A) (‘IAA’) that they were
relying on. Neither did the supporting affidavits.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    However Mr Sushil Nair, for Citus, said that
Citus were relying only on that part of s 31(2)(c) of IAA which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘31(2) A court so requested may refuse enforcement of a foreign
  award if the person against whom enforcement is sought proves to the satisfaction of the
  court that –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) he … was otherwise unable to present his case in the
    arbitration proceedings; ’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.    It was not in dispute that the reasons for the
application before me were the same reasons Citus had relied on in their appeal to the
Intermediate People’s Court.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    Mr Nair relied primarily on <i>Paklito Investment
Ltd v Klockner East Asia Ltd</i> [1993] 2 HKLR 39.</p>
<p align="justify">21.    In that case, the arbitration was also under
CIETAC. Kaplan J held, inter alia, that the defendants there did have the right to comment
on the reports of experts appointed by the arbitral tribunal and accordingly the
defendants there had been prevented from presenting their case.</p>
<p align="justify">22.    At p 49 to 50, Kaplan J said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘I have a very limited function under the Arbitration Ordinance.
  Having concluded that a serious breach of due process has occurred I cannot see that it
  would be right or proper to exercise my discretion in favour of enforcement. I am quite
  satisfied that even when one takes into account that the parties have chosen an arbitral
  law and practice which differs to that practised in Hong Kong there is still a minimum
  requirement below which an enforcing court, taking heed of its own principles of fairness
  and due process, cannot be expected to approve. Regrettably, this case is a classic
  example of such a situation.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">23.    Accordingly, Kaplan J upheld the order of Master
Cannon who had set aside her own order granting leave to enforce the arbitral award.</p>
<p align="justify">24.    In that case, the plaintiffs had argued that the
defendants should have appealed to a Chinese court rather than apply to set aside the
order granting leave to enforce the award. However Kaplan J decided this was not
necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">25.    Mr Yang argued that the facts before me were
different. Citus had appealed to the Intermediate People’s Court and had failed. That
decision was binding on Citus.</p>
<p align="justify">26.    I agreed. Although Kaplan J had decided that it
was not necessary for the defendants there to appeal to the Chinese court before seeking
an order from the Hong Kong court to set aside the order granting leave to enforce an
award, he did not say that the defendants there could have two bites at the cherry, i.e by
proceeding to a Chinese court and, if unsuccessful, then by applying to the Hong Kong
court.</p>
<p align="justify">27.    At p 48 and 49, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘It is clear to me that a party faced with a Convention award
  against him has two options. Firstly, he can apply to the courts of the country where the
  award was made to seek the setting aside of the award. If the award is set aside then this
  becomes a ground in itself for opposing enforcement under the Convention.</p>
<p align="justify">Secondly, the unsuccessful party can decide to take no steps to set
  aside the award but wait until enforcement is sought and attempt to establish a Convention
  ground of opposition.</p>
<p align="justify">That such a choice exists is made clear by Redfern and Hunter in <i>International
  Commercial Arbitration </i>p.474 where they state;</p>
<p align="justify">"He may decide to take the initiative and challenge the award; or
  he may decide to do nothing but to resist any attempts by his adversary to obtain
  recognition and enforcement of the award. The choice is a clear one – to act or not
  to act."</p>
<p align="justify">(For the English domestic position see p.546 <i>et seq</i> of <i>Mustill
  &amp; Boyd Commercial Arbitration </i>2<sup>nd</sup> ed.).’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">28.    I take this to mean that the options are
alternatives and are not cumulative.</p>
<p align="justify">29.    Indeed, at p 47, Kaplan J said that based on the
evidence before him he was satisfied that the procedural irregularity which he found to
have occurred ‘would also have been found by a Chinese court had they been invited to
consider the matter’.</p>
<p align="justify">30.    The facts before me were quite different. The
Intermediate People’s Court had been invited to consider the matter and Citus were
unsuccessful.</p>
<p align="justify">31.    I would add that the expert opinion of
Citus’ lawyer in China had criticised the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal
but had not criticised the proceedings before the Intermediate People’s Court.</p>
<p align="justify">32.    In my view, <i>Paklito</i> did not support Mr
Nair’s arguments but Mr Yang’s.</p>
<p align="justify">33.    Accordingly, Citus’ application was
dismissed with costs.</p>
