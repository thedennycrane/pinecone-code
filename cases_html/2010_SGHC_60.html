<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a small claims appeal against the
                    decision of the referee (the “Referee”) of a Small Claims Tribunal
                    (“SCT”). The grounds of decision of the Referee (“the
                    GD”) are found in <em>Tan Cheh Hiang @ Esther Tan Cheh
                        Hiang &amp; Others v Freely Pte Ltd</em> in Claim No SCT/9162/2008
                    &amp; Others.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant, Freely Pte Ltd
                    (“Freely”), the respondent in the SCT below, is a private limited
                    company in the business of running a private school. The 48 respondents (the
                    “Claimants”) were the claimants in the SCT below and are persons
                    with diverse backgrounds which, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    include working adults, professionals and retirees. The Claimants had all
                    enrolled in a three-day options trading course (the “Course”)
                    conducted by Dr Clemen Chiang (“Dr Chiang”), who was, at
                    all material times, Freely’s director, shareholder and the conductor of
                    the Course. Although there were initially 51 claims before the SCT, three
                    claimants were absent from the proceedings below. The present proceedings before
                    me involved an appeal against the decision of the Referee <em>vis-à-vis</em> 48 claims, <em>ie</em>, the
                    claims of the Claimants who were present before the SCT. All 48 claims were
                    filed in the SCT between 29 October 2008 and 3 November 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In essence, the Claimants had each made
                    individual claims against Freely for the repayment of the full price paid
                    for:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conduct of the proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       With regard to the conduct of the hearing in the
                    SCT (which was held on 12 March 2009), the Referee first noted (see [5] of
                    the GD) that “the strict rules of evidence and procedure do not apply in
                    the [SCT]”, and that “the Referee conducts a SCT hearing in
                    accordance with the principle of <em>ex aequo et bono</em>
                    (which is by principles of what is fair and just in the circumstances”.
                    As support for these propositions, the Referee referred to ss 28 and
                    30 of the Small Claims Tribunal Act (Cap 308, 1998 Rev Ed) (the
                    “SCTA”). Section 28 of the SCTA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Evidence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>28</b>. —(1) <em>A tribunal
                            shall not be bound by the rules of evidence but may inform itself on any
                            matter in such manner as it thinks fit</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Evidence tendered to a tribunal by or on behalf of a party to any
                        proceedings need not be given on oath but the tribunal may, at any stage of
                        the proceedings, require that such evidence or any part thereof be given on
                        oath whether orally or in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A tribunal may, on its own initiative, seek and receive such other
                        evidence and make such other investigations and inquiries as it thinks
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) All evidence and information received and ascertained by the tribunal
                        under subsection (3) shall be disclosed to every party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) For the purposes of subsection (2), a Referee of a tribunal is
                        empowered to administer an oath.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) A Referee may require any written evidence given in the proceedings
                        before a tribunal to be verified by statutory declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7) A Referee is not required to keep a record of the
                        evidence given in any proceedings before a tribunal but shall make
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) a summary for the purposes of section 13 (2); and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) notes of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">while s 30 of the SCTA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Control of procedure</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>30</b>. Subject to this Act and to the
                        rules, <em>a tribunal shall have control of its own procedure
                            in the hearing of claims</em> and, in the exercise of that
                        control, shall have regard to the principles of natural justice. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At this juncture, it bears mention however that
                    the informality in the proceedings of the SCT does <em>not</em> mean that the SCT may ignore substantive legal principles.
                    As noted by Louis D’Souza in “An Experiment in Informal Justice:
                    The Small Claims Tribunal of Singapore” [1991] 3 SAcLJ 264
                    (“D’Souza’s Article”) at p 266:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>(c)  Simplicity</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The small claims process strives for simplicity. In most jurisdictions,
                        there were no rigid and complex rules governing the procedures of the
                        courts. “Only the general outlines of procedure were specified and
                        the details were left to the discretion of the judge. In particular, judges
                        were not to be bound by formal rules of evidence, <em>though
                            a decision were to be reached on the basis of substantive
                        law</em>.” The classic example of this is found in
                        section 12 (4) of the Singapore Small Claims Tribunals Act5 which
                        provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A tribunal shall determine the dispute according to the substantial merits
                        and justice of the case and in doing so <em>shall have regard
                            to the law but shall not be bound to give effect to strict legal forms
                            or technicalities</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       To my mind, the above view (<em>viz</em>, that although an SCT is not bound to give effect to strict
                    legal forms or technicalities, it must nonetheless determine disputes according
                    to substantive legal principles) is implicitly buttressed by
                        s 38(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SCTA which gives an
                    aggrieved party, who has obtained from the District Court leave to appeal (see
                    s 38(1B) of the SCTA), an opportunity to appeal against an order of the SCT
                    “on any ground involving a question of law” .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Referee then explained how the proceedings
                    before the hearing proper and at the hearing itself (which was on 12 March
                    2009) were actually conducted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The proceedings were
                            regulated in the following
                            manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    In respect of the
                            pre-hearing procedure, I introduced these steps to save time and costs
                            for all parties concerned:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    Around 2-3 weeks before the hearing, I
                                directed the SCT to record written statement of facts from the
                                Claimants and the Respondent. This was a necessary departure from
                                the usual SCT convention where parties orally relate their facts to
                                the Referee at the hearing itself. If the convention was followed,
                                the hearing would have taken an inordinately long time simply to
                                elicit the parties’ respective version of
                            events.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The SCT first took statement from the
                                Claimants. They recounted common facts as they were all course-mates
                                present at the same talks given by Dr. Chiang. They also relied on
                                the same Straits Times reports as evidence of their case. For this
                                reason, I did not think it necessary to inconvenience the Respondent
                                to tender 51 written statements in answer to each of the
                                Claimant’s statement. Instead, I prepared a brief chronology
                                of the Claimants’ facts (Summary of Claimants’ Statement
                                of Facts) and directed the Respondent to submit their written
                                response thereto (Respondent’s Statement of
                            Facts).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    On the day of the
                            hearing, I started by explaining my role as a Referee, the procedures in
                            conducting the hearing, and the reasons behind the use of the
                            statements. I then secured the parties’ consent to
                        proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The first witness called was Esther Tan Cheh
                                Hiang (the Claimant in SCT 9162/2008) who led evidence for the
                                Claimants. Esther Tan was selected because she gave testimony in
                                Mandarin. This enabled the Mandarin-only speaking Claimants to
                                understand and follow the proceedings. Moreover, Esther Tan was also
                                a party to all 3 Contracts [<em>ie</em>, the
                                Course, the Software and the Webinar] with the Respondent. Hence her
                                evidence would be relevant to all the issues covered in this
                                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   To begin, I read to Esther Tan the Summary of
                                the Claimants’ Statement of Facts and recorded her affirmation
                                on the contents therein. Thereafter, I obtained confirmation from
                                the rest of the Claimants that they similarly adopt the same
                                chronology of facts appearing in the Summary of Claimants’
                                Statement of Facts. In the course of the hearing, I also allowed
                                several other Claimants to testify on matters not mentioned in the
                                said Summary.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   After the Claimants’ turn, I called
                                Dr. Chiang to lead evidence for the Respondent. I read to him the
                                Respondent’s Statement of Facts and likewise recorded his
                                affirmation on its contents.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   In the course of the hearing, and in exercise
                                of my inquisitorial fact finding role as a Referee, I also
                                administered questions to the parties and recorded
                            answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At this stage, it would be useful to reproduce
                    the Summary of Claimants’ Statement of Facts and Freely’s Statement

                            (“the Preview”). At this Preview, [Dr Chiang] made

                    a Doctor of Philosophy, <em>ie</em>, a Ph.D in options
                    trading and had designed the Course around his Ph.D dissertation (the
                    “representation”). On its part, Freely did not dispute making the
                    representation as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Freely’s Statement of Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In reply to the Summary of Claimants’
                    Statement of Facts, Dr Chiang, on Freely’s behalf, stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    I am Clemen Chiang
                            Wen Yuan….[and] I am the authorized representative of the
                            Respondent in these
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    I am the Chief
                            Executive Officer and Speaker of the FREELY METHOD options trading
                            course in Freely Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    I
                            have read the Summary of the Claimants’ Statement of Facts and
                            wish to respond as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    I
                            disagree with paragraph 1 of [the] Statement of Facts
                        because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The “Once In A Blue Moon”
                                software is also known as “The Freely Method” in the
                                contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    I agree with
                            paragraph 2 of [the] Statement of
                            Facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    I agree with paragraph
                            3 of [the] Statement of
                            Facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 4 of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    I did not state that the PHD was from a
                                prestigious university;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The FREELY Method of options trading is easy
                                to learn as long as I facilitate the teaching process;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   I did not say that. I mentioned that
                                anything to do with investment is risky and going through the
                                programme saves time for the learning process and the application of
                                concepts;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   The contract stated clearly that the
                                programme is only for 3 days, anything after the programme is [a]
                                privilege between teachers and students, and not a contractual
                                promise; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    A variable discount off the seminar price is
                                given.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 5 of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The students signed up for the options trading
                                course based on their interest in the knowledge and not because of
                                my PHD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 6(a) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The music and screened movies were to prepare
                                them psychologically in the field of options trading;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   I did not teach students to do acts of
                                meditation. I played them a 20 minute CD called “Millionaire
                                Mindset” about hypnotherapy;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   I did not tell stories about “racing
                                history” and I do not know what this is referring
                            to;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   I did not get angry with students, nor behave
                                disrespectfully to them by calling them “idiots”. With
                                respect to my conduct to the students, the students have given
                                positive feedback such that I scored an average of 4.7 out of 5 in
                                the feedback forms from all the claimants. They gave encouraging
                                comments like “You are the best speaker I have seen”
                                and “Your seminar was very motivating and
                                informative”.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    There is also a money back guarantee (clause
                                20 of the Freely contract) and a refund can be given by 6 p.m. of
                                day one of the seminar. There have been genuine cases of students
                                who were refunded the full amount at the end of day
                            one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 6(b) of the Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    I did not hurry through the subject of options
                                trading. I did not evade questions but answered them until 4a.m. the
                                next day;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   I did not give a short demonstrations on
                                going online into the US market, but a detailed one;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   I did not provide less than one hour of
                                hands on practice. This part of the seminar lasted from 9 p.m.
                                – 1.30 a.m.;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   The course ended at 12 midnight on the first
                                two day and between 3 a.m. – 6 a.m. on the third day;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    I sold the products during lunchtime or
                                dinnertime of the third day, hence they could only purchase the
                                [S[oftware within the 60-minute period while the administrative
                                staff was still present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 6(c) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    I did not say that [the] claimants could not
                                carry out options trading successfully without the [S]oftware, only
                                that it would take lots of time to analyze the method. The
                                [S]oftware will reduce the time to 20 minutes, as it was aggregated
                                data from many websites to make it convenient for students to
                                analyze the [S[oftware.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    I agree with
                            paragraph 6(d) of [the] Statement of
                            Facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(j)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 6(e) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    I did not promise a gathering every three
                                months as I would be going away for studies, as stated in paragraph
                                4(g) of [the] Statement of Facts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The Google group is a privilege, from a
                                student-teacher relationship and not [a] contractual guarantee
                                stated in the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(k)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 7(a) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The matter is between the U.S. Universities
                                and the relevant authorities. I have produced the announcement from
                                Preston University in response to the allegations regarding Preston
                                University in [the] Straits Times.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(l)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 7(b) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The [S]oftware has a market value of
                                S$16,000.00 as money had to be paid for data feeding of the
                                information online to the [S]oftware;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The online portal contained accurate and
                                up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   Users of the [S]oftware have been able to
                                log in to the [S]oftware until now. This is reflected in the login
                                history we have; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   There have been regular software
                                updates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(m)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 7(c) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    This “Kick Start and Protégé”
                                web-seminar course is conducted via a “Web Ex
                                platform”, which allows the students to view the video at
                                home. Due to copyright issues, the viewing sessions are limited to
                                three views.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(n)    I disagree with
                            paragraph 7(d) of [the] Statement of Facts because:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The Google Groups discussion forum is still
                                around;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   I did not evade genuine queries from students
                                about options trading;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   I did not deliberately change the office
                                address and telephone numbers. Our tenancy expired in end of August
                                2008 and we had to downsize to a smaller premise[s]. The change in
                                address and telephone number is available on our
                            website;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   I did not cancel as I never promised to hold
                                a gathering in the first place;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    I did not teach other options trading
                                course[s];</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(vi)   I did not tell the claimants that Freely
                                School does not exist anymore; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(vii)  Freely School does not provide a course that
                                was far inferior to similar courses and this opinion is also in
                                direct contradiction to the feedback forms. One of the claimants
                                stated, “You are the best speaker I have
                            seen”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(o)    I disagree with

                                “link” to my PHD; I said that our standing in society

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The Preston University saga affected

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Referee’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After hearing evidence from the respective
                    parties, the Referee concluded that “[Freely] should bear liability
                    [under s 4(<em>a</em>) of the Consumer Protection
                    (Fair Trading) Act (Cap 52A, 2004 Rev Ed) (the “CPFTA”)]
                    for the unfair practice of misleading the [Claimants]” (see [25] of the
                    GD) and made the following orders (see [26] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     in respect of the Course, Freely was
                        to pay to each Claimant a sum equivalent to the price paid <em>less</em> S$885.00, the latter amount being how much a
                        pared-down version of Freely’s curriculum was worth in the market (see
                        [23(b)-(c)] of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     in respect of the Software and the Webinar, Freely was to
                        refund to each Claimant the <em>full</em> price paid
                        (see [23(b) of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Freely to pay each Claimant disbursements fixed at
                        S$10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Freely’s arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before me, Freely argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Referee had erred in his
                        conclusion of the limitation period under s 5(3)(<em>b</em>) SCTA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Referee had applied the wrong test for “unfair
                        practice” under s 4(<em>a</em>) read with
                            s 5(3)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    CPFTA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     there were
                        breaches of natural justice in the manner in which the SCT hearing was
                        conducted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        Referee had applied the wrong test in determining whether there was a price
                        advantage in respect of the Software;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     the Referee had breached s 28(4) of the SCTA in
                        producing his own evidence of a two-day course on options trading conducted

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The SCTA and CPFTA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the second reading in Parliament of the
                    Small Claims Tribunal Bill (Act 27 of 1984), the Minister for Labour and
                    Second Minister for Law and Home Affairs, Professor S. Jayakumar, elaborated on
                    the rationale behind the SCTA (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (24 August 1984) vol 44 at
                    cols 1999-2002:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The Minister for Labour and Second Minister for Law and
                            Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar)</b>: Mr Deputy Speaker,
                        Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now
                        read a Second time." The primary purpose of this Bill is to <em>provide for a speedy and inexpensive machinery to handle small
                            claims arising from disputes between consumers and suppliers</em>.
                        The Bill seeks to do this by authorizing the setting up of one or more Small
                        Claims Tribunals to deal with the settlement and adjudication of these
                        claims. The Small Claims Tribunal will be constituted as part of the
                        Subordinate Courts but will not be bound by strict rules of evidence or by
                        normal court procedures. To ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and that
                        a litigant will not be at a disadvantage because he is unable to afford
                        legal representation, the Bill provides that the parties to the proceedings
                        must present their own case and excludes representation by an advocate and
                        solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although this Bill is being introduced by the Ministry of Law, it has its
                        origin in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, whose <em>objective for the Bill is to create a new institution to help consumers
                            to protect themselves</em>. Before touching on specific aspects of
                        the Bill, I would like to <em>briefly restate Government's
                            basic thinking on consumer protection. The Government believes that the
                            consumers are best protected through free trade and competition in a
                            free market. Competition not only ensures that prices are the lowest
                            possible but also ensures good quality and service. However, this does
                            not mean that the consumer can make his purchases blindly. In order to
                            get the most out of the free market, the consumer has to be vigilant and
                            must shop around to compare prices, quality and services. He must also
                            be aware of his rights as a party to a contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Sir, our better informed consumers are now becoming
                            more conscious of their rights as consumers and are more ready to assert
                            their rights. Unfortunately, the market place is never always a perfect
                            one nor operated entirely by honest traders. Consumers who have
                            purchased defective products or have been given shoddy services
                            sometimes encounter recalcitrant traders or workmen whenever they seek
                            redress. Those who are confronted with this problem now have two courses
                            of action open to them</em>. They can seek the help of the
                        Consumers Association of Singapore…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second course is for consumers to seek their redress and remedies in
                        the courts. However, proceedings in the courts are often expensive,
                        time-consuming and subject to technical and procedural complexities. The
                        recovery of small claims, that is claims below $2,000, may therefore be
                        hardly worth the effort. Cost is involved and is prohibitive and may well
                        exceed the amount which the successful litigant could recover.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, therefore, <em>a clear need for a cheaper and
                            less formal forum to deal with such small claims</em>. As the
                        decisions of the Small Claims Tribunal become widely known, it will also
                        help consumers to become more aware of their rights. Sir, this Bill attempts
                        to assist a consumer who has a claim of up to $2,000 relating to the sale of
                        defective goods or to the provision of shoddy or unsatisfactory workmanship
                        to pursue such a claim in a Small Claims Tribunal. Claims above $2,000 will
                        be dealt with by the normal civil courts. <em>Through the
                            tribunals, it is hoped that such small claims can be [solved] quickly to
                            the satisfaction of the parties concerned</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The informality of the tribunal and its <em>simplified procedure</em> should enable any layman to present his
                        own case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Bill represents an important milestone in the field of consumer
                        protection, and I hope that Members will whole-heartedly support it.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As is clear from the foregoing excerpt, the
                    SCTA was to provide a simple, informal and inexpensive way for a complaint
                    involving a small claim to be heard (see also D’Souza’s Article at
                    p 269).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I now come to the CPFTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Given that all 48 of the present claims were
                    filed in the SCT between 29 October 2008 and 3 November 2008,
                    references to the CPFTA are to the 2004 Revised Edition of this statute and
                        <em>not</em> to the 2009 Revised Edition (<em>ie</em>, Consumer Protection (Fair Trading)
                    Act (Cap 52A, 2009 Rev Ed) which incorporated amendments to the CPFTA
                    (see Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Amendment) Act 2008 (No 15 of
                    2008)) which only took effect from 15 April 2009 (<em>ie</em>, after the claims in the present instance were
                filed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The CPFTA was passed on 11 March 2003 and
                    came into effect on 1 March 2004. Professor Ravi Chandran
                    (“Chandran”), in what appears to be the only local commentary on
                    the CPFTA thus far, <em>viz</em>, “Consumer
                    Protection (Fair Trading) Act)” [2004] S.J.L.S. 192 , has noted at
                    p 192 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>CPFTA</em> is to a large extent based on the
                        Saskatchewan <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>. However,
                        the <em>CPFTA</em> also bears some resemblance to the
                        Australian <em>Trade Practices Act</em>, the <em>Alberta Fair Trading Act</em>, the <em>British Columbia Trade Practices Act</em>, and the <em>New Zealand Fair Trading Act</em>… [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I should stress however, that although the
                    drafting of the CPFTA appears to have been inspired by equivalent legislation in
                    various jurisdictions, it would be inappropriate to import, <em>carte blanche</em>, <em>all</em> principles
                    applicable to the interpretation of the equivalent legislation in other
                    jurisdictions, unless these principles accord with the wording of our CPFTA and
                    Parliament’s intention in enacting the CPFTA in Singapore, the latter of
                    which I will now come to.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry
                            (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)</b>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg
                        to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, for some years now, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), as
                        well as several Members of this House, have advocated the enactment of a
                        fair trading law. <em>This is because while some particularly
                            offensive practices like cheating or intimidation are prohibited under
                            our criminal laws, many errant sales tactics, such as bait advertising,
                            misrepresentation, and hard selling, are not clearly covered by any of
                            our existing laws</em>. In 2001, a joint private and public
                        taskforce, co-led by CASE and MTI, was formed to study this issue. In 2002,
                        the Government accepted the recommendation of the taskforce to enact a Fair
                        Trading Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Key Provisions of the Bill</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill now before the House is <em>principally designed
                            to accord better protection to consumers by allowing them to seek civil
                            redress against traders engaging in unfair practices. The primary focus
                            is on small consumers who lack the expertise and resources to fend for
                            themselves against unfair practices</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Clause 4 of the Bill defines what constitutes an unfair
                            practice, and 20 such examples are listed in the Second Schedule. The
                            trader must not mislead the consumer. He should provide the consumer
                            with all relevant and material information in order that the consumer
                            can make an informed decision</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 6 of the Bill allows consumers aggrieved by unfair practices to
                        obtain civil remedies from the trader before the court. They can do so
                        within one year of the discovery of the unfair practice. As the Act is
                        intended primarily to protect small consumers, the claim amount will be
                        capped at $20,000. We expect most claims to be filed in the Small Claims
                        Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In determining whether or not the trader has engaged in
                            an unfair practice, the court will consider the reasonableness of the
                            trader's actions in the circumstances surrounding the unfair
                            practice</em>. The court shall also have regard to whether or not
                        the consumer made a reasonable effort to resolve the dispute with the
                        trader, and to minimise any loss or damage resulting from the unfair
                        practice. These provisions are in clauses 5 and 7 of the Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Balance between consumers and traders</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, in drafting this Bill, we are <em>mindful of the need
                            to balance the interests of the consumers and traders. On the one hand,
                            the Act must provide adequate safeguards for consumers and allow
                            them legal recourse to claim against unfair practices. On the other
                            hand, we do not want to over-regulate and add to business
                            costs</em>. Amongst traders, those who engage in unfair practices
                        are a minority. It will be unfair to impose undue regulatory costs on the
                        majority who conduct business ethically. This would also be bad for
                        consumers, for such costs will in the end be passed back to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have also chosen not to criminalise unfair practices. This is because
                        the more serious offences are already covered by existing legislation. There
                        are no criminal sanctions in our proposed legislation. Instead <em>the Bill will hold traders accountable for unfair practices by
                            making them liable for civil restitution</em>. This will empower
                        consumers to seek civil remedies against errant traders, without having to
                        rely on or wait for the Government to take action. Besides allowing for
                        quick redress, this approach of self reliance will encourage greater
                        consumer responsibility and pro-activity.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In his closing remarks at the conclusion of
                    the second reading, the Minister also elaborated on the underlying philosophy
                    behind the enactment of the CPFTA (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (11 November 2003)

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry
                            (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)</b>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am
                        very pleased that this particular Bill has generated such interest among
                        Members. I think it bodes well for the Bill, as a key thrust of the Bill is
                        to raise awareness of the issues involved in consumer protection. I have
                        listened very carefully to all the suggestions. In particular, I would like
                        to thank Members for the support that they have given to the Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>But let me just put things in perspective to begin
                            with. What is the underlying philosophy when we drafted this Bill?
                            Basically two</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>One is that the principle of caveat emptor remains.
                            That is the operating paradigm. What does it mean when we say "buyers
                            beware"? It means that, as a society, we believe that the individual
                            should take responsibility for his or her own action when he or she
                            enters into a transaction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Two, we must all be aware that it is not just one
                            interest here, but two interests to balance off. On the one hand, yes,
                            we would like to give adequate protection for the small consumer not to
                            be taken advantage of and enter into an unfair transaction. On the other
                            hand, it is businesses and traders. There should be business certainty
                            and not undue costs in complying with this proposed Act. So, let us bear
                            that in mind, because this informs the Act and the drafting of the
                            Act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… So, the context is quite different. What we have done here - and
                        as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said in his speech - is <em>really
                            to enable the consumer to seek civil redress, if there has been an
                            unfair practice</em>. Criminal offences are already in the books
                        for the more serious offences, such as cheating, touting, false labelling.
                            <em>So, the Bill is really quite similar to the other
                            consumer protection legislations that we have in Singapore today such as
                            the Misrepresentation Act, Unfair Contract Terms Act, Hire Purchase
                            Act</em>. In none of these consumer protection Acts have we
                        created a body to police these Acts. And the fact that there has been no
                        agency created for these has not affected the effectiveness of the Act. The
                        intent and purpose of the Act have been fulfilled.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The interplay between the SCTA and the CPFTA
                    can be found in s 7(1) CPFTA which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1">The above provision in the CPFTA referring to the SCTA is significant
                    because the SCTA itself does not expressly refer to the CPFTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Limitation period</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having touched upon the legislative framework
                    surrounding the respective enactments of the SCTA and the CPFTA, this would be a
                    convenient juncture to refer to the relevant limitation period as this point was
                    raised by Freely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 12(1) of the CPFTA states:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">whichever occurs later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The applicable provision is
                        s 12(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) CPFTA. On the other hand,
                    s 5(3) SCTA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5</b>. —(3) Except where this
                        Act expressly provides otherwise, the jurisdiction of a tribunal shall

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) after the expiration of one year from
                        the date on which the cause of action accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Referee applied s 12(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) to the Claimants’ claims. He was of the view
                    that the date of accrual of their cause of action for the purpose of the SCTA
                    was the date they had knowledge that Freely’s representation was
                    misleading. This was the date of publication of the article in the Straits Times
                    of 29 August 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     While I accept that s 5(3) SCTA should
                    logically incorporate the knowledge provision of s 12(1)(<em>b</em>) CPFTA, it does not. In other words, the terms of s 5(3)
                    SCTA do not explicitly state that the date of the cause of action is the date
                    the consumer had knowledge that the supplier had engaged in the unfair practice
                    in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Accordingly, it is arguable that the Referee
                    was not correct when he effectively applied s 12(1)(<em>b</em>) CPFTA to s 5(3) SCTA. However, although counsel for
                    Freely invited me to make a ruling on the point as it was likely to be relevant
                    for the other pending claims, I declined to do so for the time being. Counsel
                    for the Claimants had declined to present any argument on the point since it was
                    irrelevant to the Claimants he represented as they did not face an issue of
                    limitation unlike the other claimants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Class action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the present instance, the Referee had
                    invoked s 26 of the SCTA, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Claims may be heard together</b>

                            them;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the claims arose out of the same cause of action; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) it would be in the interests of justice,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the tribunal may order that such claims be heard at the same time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The power conferred by this secton may be exercised by a tribunal
                        notwithstanding that he hearing of one or more the claims has begun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">for <em>all</em> 51 (which, as mentioned above,
                    was the original number of claims supposed to be heard) claims to be heard
                    together in a single sitting because “it would have been highly
                    impractical and uneconomical for the SCT to host 51 separate hearings especially
                    since the claims involve common question[s] of law and fact” (see [5] of
                    the GD). The Referee had also likened the present proceedings to a “class
                    action” (see [2] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I am not entirely convinced that a class
                    action should be dealt with by an SCT under s 26 of the SCTA, which is
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with s 20 of the Hong
                    Kong Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance. Indeed, the Class Actions Sub-committee of
                    The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (“Hong Kong Law Reform
                    Commission”), in its recent Consultation Paper on Class
                        Actions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> published on 5 November
                    2009, recommended at p 243, that an SCT should <em>not</em> be empowered to hear class action proceedings. It noted at
                    p 242, [9.36] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.36  The <em>function of the Small
                                Claims Tribunal is to enable individuals to enforce small claims by
                                way of an uncomplicated procedure. For this reason, it is suggested
                                that the Tribunal should not be empowered to hear class
                                actions</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Given that the SCTA was established to
                    provide, <em>inter alia</em>, a <em>simple</em> way for a complaint involving a small claim to be heard,
                    the view of the Hong Kong Law Reform Commission may be said to apply with equal
                    force in the Singapore context. In addition, the total quantum of claims in a
                    class action may exceed the monetary limit for any one of such claims (<em>ie</em>, $10,000 at the material time) by a large margin, as
                    was the case before me. Be that as it may however, given that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     the view of the Hong Kong Law Reform
                        Commission was <em>only</em> a <em>recommendation</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     section 26 of the SCTA, as presently worded, is
                        sufficiently wide, on a literal reading, to encompass the class action in
                        the present instance,</p>
<p class="Judg-1">it seems that an SCT may hear a
                    class action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, Parliament may wish to review whether
                    the machinery of an SCT is indeed intended, and well equipped, to deal with
                    class actions especially where they involve allegations of misrepresentation.
                    Such actions may become more prevalent in the future. As already mentioned,
                    there are more than 400 claims pending against Freely before an SCT. Parliament
                    may also want to consider whether the machinery of an SCT should apply to class
                    actions where the total quantum of claims exceeds the monetary limit of any one
                    of such claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 4(a) of the CPFTA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I now move on to examine what constitutes an
                    “unfair practice” under the CPFTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The material provision which underpinned the
                    Referee’s decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Course was
                        s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Section 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA closely resembles s 5(<em>a</em>) of the Saskatchewan Consumer Protection Act (S.S. 1996,
                    c. C-30.1)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    (“SCPA”) which reads as follows:</p>

<b>Unfair practices</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    It is an unfair
                            practice for a supplier, in a transaction or proposed transaction

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As to how s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA should be interpreted, Chandran concludes at
                    pp 201-203 that “whether…conduct has been misleading or
                    deceptive has to be tested against the standard of a reasonable man”,
                        <em>ie</em>, objectively:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 52 of the Australian <em>Trade Practices
                            Act </em>provides that: “A corporation shall not, in
                        trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is
                        likely to mislead or deceive”. In this regard, <em>several Australian cases</em> [<em>per</em>
                        Gibbs C.H. in <em>Parkdale v PUXU</em> (1982)
                        42 ALR 1 at 6 and <em>per</em> Northrop J. in
                            <em>Annand &amp; Thompson v TPC</em> (1979)
                        25 ALR 91 at 111. See also the New Zealand Case of <em>Marcol Manufacturers Ltd v Commerce Commission</em>
                        [1991] 2 NZLR 502] <em>have held that whether the

                            “reasonable” does not appear in the Australian statute. A
                            fortiori, since the Singapore statute specifically refers to
                            reasonableness, clearly the test is objective</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In addition Australian cases have held
                            that intention to mislead is not a necessary ingredient</em>. For
                        instance, in <em>Parkdale v. P.U.X.U</em>. [(1982)
                        41 ALR 1 at 5], Gibbs C.J. stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There is nothing in the section that would confine it to conduct
                            which was engaged in as a result of a failure to take reasonable care.

                                liability imposed by s 52 . . . is thus quite unrelated to
                                fault</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Similarly, in <em>Global Sportsman v.
                            Mirror</em> [(1984) 55 ALR 25 at 30], the court
                        stated,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>Whether or not s 52(1) is contravened does not
                                depend upon the corporation’s intention or its belief

                            whether the statement in fact contains or conveys a meaning which is
                            false, that is to say whether the statement contains or conveys a
                            misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This also appears to be the position in Canada [referring to <em>Findlay v Couldwell and Beywood Motors</em> (1976)
                        5 W.W.R. 340 at 345 and <em>Mikulus v Milo European
                            Cars Specialists Ltd</em> (1993) CPR (3d) 1 at 10] and
                        New Zealand [referring to <em>Marcol Manufacturers Ltd v
                            Commerce Commission</em> [1991] 2 NZLR 502 at 508].
                        Thus, it is likely that Singapore courts would also adopt this stand in
                        relation to conduct which is misleading. In fact this position in Canada,
                        Australia and New Zealand, is not only in respect of civil liability but
                        also criminal liability. In Singapore there is only civil liability and no
                        direct criminal liability for the breach of any of the provisions of the
                            <em>CPFTA</em>. Thus <em>a
                            fortiori</em>, <em>the lack or presence of
                            intention should be irrelevant</em>. This view is further
                        fortified by the fact that in Singapore, some of the specific provisions
                        under Second Schedule [such as clauses 4, 5, 13, 17 and 18] require…
                        knowledge or intention in order to give rise to liability. This suggests
                        that where there is no express reference to knowledge or intention in the
                        section or where the words themselves do not by implication raise the
                        need for intention or knowledge, which is clearly the case with
                        section 4(a) in so far as it deals with misleading conduct, knowledge
                        or intention should be irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, in relation to the word “deceived”,
                        there is some suggestion in Australia that that may involve some element of
                        fault. For instance in <em>Henjo Investments Pty. Ltd. v.
                            Collins Marrickville Pty. Ltd</em> [(1989) 79 ALR 83 at
                        92]]., Lockhart J. stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“misleading” and “deceptive”, are plainly
                            not synonymous <em>. . .</em> .
                            “Mislead” does not necessarily involve an element of
                            intent and it is a word of wider reach than “deceive”.
                            However, it is difficult, in my opinion, to read the word
                            “deceive” in s 52 other than as involving some degree
                            of moral turpitude as it does in ordinary English usage. Trickery, craft
                            and guile . . . are typically at the heart of this second element of the
                            statutory provision directed to the protection of the public from unfair
                            trading practices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This can be contrasted with <em>the position
                            in Canada where cases have held that an action can be deceptive even

<em>Of the two views, it is suggested that the position in
                            Canada is to be preferred. The emphasis in section 4(a), too, seems
                            to be on the effect on a reasonable consumer rather than on the intent

                        stated above is adopted, it may not really make much of a practical
                        difference. This is so because even if deception cannot be established
                        because of a lack of intention, the conduct is likely to be misleading
                        nonetheless and hence the supplier may still be liable.</p>

                        (BCCA)], the British Columbia Supreme Court said that <em>a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The view that the supplier’s state of mind or

                            practice under s.5(a) is consistent with the objective quality of the
                            wording that both the British Columbia and Saskatchewan legislation
                            employ… However, the doctrinal waters on this point are muddled
                            by the vaguely worded s.7(5) [of the SCPA] [which is in pari materia
                            with s 5(3)(a) of the CPFTA], which provides that, “In

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no equivalent of s.7(5) in British Columbia or elsewhere. In
                        provinces other than Saskatchewan, a supplier is apparently not excused by
                        acting reasonably if his or her conduct is misleading or deceptive.
                        …</p>

<em>The implication of the statutory qualification found in
                            s.7(5) [of the SCPA] is unclear. While it appears that a supplier is
                            exonerated of responsibility for deceptive or misleading conduct if he
                            or she acted reasonably, the Act offers no guidance [as in the
                            CPFTA] as to what is or is not reasonable, nor how reasonableness
                            relates to state of mind. Is a supplier who honestly believes a
                            misrepresentation about her product to be true, but could by making
                            inquiries have determined its falsity, liable under s.5(a)? Is a
                            supplier whose conduct is consistent with ordinary business practices
                            excused, even though that conduct might reasonably mislead a consumer?
                            Has a supplier committed an unfair practice if she believes that a
                            particular consumer is not being misled, though the conduct in question
                            has the capacity to mislead a reasonable consumer? The unique problems
                            presented by this provision require careful consideration on the part of
                            those charged with its interpretation and application. Although s.7(5)
                            offers some comfort to suppliers faced with the challenges of the new
                            legislation, the ambiguity it creates exacerbates the already difficult
                            task of determining whether a particular incident or course of conduct

                            arose in the very early misleading conduct case law. In its first major

                                prohibition is concerned with consequences as giving to particular
                                conduct a particular colour” and hence in claims based on
                                s 52, ‘nothing turns…upon the intent’ of the
                                defendant. Like the tort of passing off, it was said, s 52 is
                                designed to ensure that ‘trading must not only be honest but

                                Ltd</em>, the Full Federal Court noted that <em>the essential characteristic of misleading or deceptive conduct is
                                that it ‘contains or conveys a meaning which is false’
                                and that where the impugned conduct consists of a ‘statement
                                of past or present fact’, the speaker’s ‘state of
                                mind is immaterial’ to whether the conduct embodied such a
                                meaning. Nevertheless, the court commented, ‘[m]any
                                statements, for example, promises, predictions and opinions, do
                                involve the state of mind of the maker of the statement at the time
                                [it] was made’. A decision as to whether such conduct conveyed
                                a false meaning will therefore necessarily involve consideration of
                                whether ‘the maker of the statement had a particular state of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>3.11</b>]    The relevance of
                            intention in such cases has been widely acknowledged. In <em>Bridge Stockbrokers Ltd v Bridges</em> [(1984)

                            may be necessary, concerning ‘the intent of the alleged
                            offender…in determining whether conduct is misleading or
                            deceptive’. While acknowledging that intent was ‘not an
                            essential element in the notion of misleading or deceptive
                            conduct’, his Honour expressed the view that
                            ‘deceptive’ in s 52 could bear the meaning of
                            ‘cheating, ensnaring or deliberately misleading’ and
                            envisaged circumstances ‘where there will be deceptive conduct
                            only where the intention of the [defendant] is established’.
                            Lockhart J gave the example of conduct which is intentionally designed
                            to create mere confusion in order to avoid contravening the prohibition.
                            The ramifications of these dicta have not been explored in subsequent

                            dishonesty may convert what would otherwise not be misleading conduct

                            in the impugned activity, a separate question arises as to the
                            significance of a finding to that effect. Indeed, it is in relation to
                            the latter issue that Lockhart J’s comments in [<em>Bridge Stockbrokers Ltd v Bridges</em> [(1984)

                            regarding intention appear to have provoked a response in the form of
                            subsequent acceptance that proof of intention to mislead may have
                            probative value in establishing that the prohibition has been
                            breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The high point to date of that recognition was the Full Federal
                        Court’s decision in <em>Telmak Teleproducts (Aust) Pty
                            Ltd v Coles Myer Ltd</em> [(1989) 89 ALR 48], in which
                        it was accepted that proof of an intention to deceive, whilst not of itself
                        establishing that conduct was misleading or deceptive, was ‘of
                        powerful evidentiary value’ in the finely balanced factual matrix of
                        the case, tipping the scales in favour of a holding that s 52 had been
                        breached. To date, however, the persuasive worth of such proof has been
                        explored principally in relation to [Australian Trade Practices Act] claims
                        resembling passing off actions at common law, and accordingly the matter
                        will be explored further in that context below.</p>

                                prohibition can also be distinguished from another general law
                                analogue, that of negligent misrepresentation, in so far as the
                                fault of the defendant is concerned. While liability under the
                                general law action is founded upon the defendant’s negligence,
                                questions as to the level of care taken by the defendant to avoid

                            In [<em>Parkdale v PUXU</em> (1982)
                            42 ALR 1], for example, Gibbs CJ, in a comment that has never
                            been doubted, noted that <em>there was ‘nothing in
                                [s 52] which would confine it to conduct which was engaged in as a
                                result of a failure to take reasonable care. Further, neither
                                knowledge of the misleading character of the conduct nor a lack of
                                good faith are necessary for the prohibition to be
                                breached</em>.</p>

<em>The significance of proof of fault</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>3.14</b>]    In contrast to
                            the developments regarding intention which were discussed in the
                            preceding paragraphs, the courts have rarely acknowledged that proof of
                            a lack of care by the person who allegedly engaged in misleading conduct
                            can have evidentiary significance in the determination of whether the
                            prohibition has been contravened. The proposition that
                            ‘carelessness on the part of the respondent is not a necessary
                            element of a s 52’ claim [as stated in <em>Neilsen v Hempston Holdings Pty Ltd</em> (1986)

                            occasional hints that proof of carelessness may be of assistance in
                            establishing a breach of the prohibition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services

                        was conduct of the proscribed character. In view of the paucity of reference
                        to the issue in the case law to date, however, the role that evidence of
                        carelessness might play in a court’s decision as to whether conduct is
                        misleading or deceptive, or likely to have that effect, remains to be

                    than the common law of negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation, both of which

                            Consequently, s 52 can be contravened even though, when engaging in
                            the conduct in question, the respondent had no intention of misleading
                            or deceiving the audience to whom it was directed and had taken all

                            imposes strict liability. For this reason, the section is likely to
                            provide the victims of misrepresentation with a means of redress that is

                            FLR 340 at 348]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“[s.9] is a comprehensive provision of wide impact, which does
                            not adopt the language of any common law action. It does not purport to
                            create liability; rather it creates a norm of conduct, failure to
                            observe which has consequences provided elsewhere in the same statute or
                            under general law. In my view effect should be given to the ordinary
                            meaning of the words used. They should not be qualified or (if it be
                            possible) expanded by reference to establish common law principles of
                            liability. At the same time, known concepts such as those concerning the
                            torts of deceit and passing off and the analyses made of them over the
                            years, may prove useful in deciding a case under [s.9]…Intention
                            is not a necessary ingredient…The tort is more objective, but
                            [it] is not precisely correct to apply the concept of the hypothetical
                            reasonable man. One looks to the audience, of the relevant parts of it,
                            and absurdities aside, ask whether the conduct complained of was to them
                            misleading or deceptive, but the question is not simply whether they (or
                            he) were (or was) mislead. Whether the conduct was misleading or
                            deceptive is a matter for the court…Doubtless the audience to be
                            considered can be classified as “consumers”. Conduct will
                            not mislead or deceive a person having a conscious awareness of the true
                            facts of the correct information.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 9 is the central provision of the Fair Trading Act. There has
                        been a marked reluctance in Australia to read down the words of the
                        equivalent section (s.52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Aust)).
                        What is misleading or deceptive is a matter of fact to be resolved in the
                        circumstances and context of each case. The trend in Australia is that the
                        prohibition is being applied in an ever widening range of circumstances. It
                        has generally superseded the torts of deceit and passing off and is being
                        used more frequently in contractual misrepresentation situations.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cases under s.52 [in Australia] are legion…Many turn

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Given the foregoing, this would now be an
                    appropriate juncture to summarise, what in my view are <em>some</em> (<em>ie</em>, non-exhaustive)
                    principles applicable to s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA,
                    bearing in mind the differences in wording between this provision, s 52 of
                    the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974, s 9 of the New Zealand Fair
                    Trading Act 1986 and any similarity with the SCPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether conduct has been misleading
                        or deceptive under s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA,
                        which specifically refers to the word “reasonable”, has to be
                        tested objectively, in relation to one or more identified sections of the
                        public, the Court considering all who fall within an identified
                        section of the public, including the astute and the gullible, the

                        poorly educated, men and women of various ages pursuing a variety of
                        vocations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     it
                        would appear, from a plain reading of s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA which makes no express reference to
                        knowledge or intention, that an intention or knowledge to mislead or deceive
                            (<em>ie</em>, a fault element) is not a necessary
                        ingredient. The emphasis in s 4(<em>a</em>) of the
                        CPFTA is on the effect on a reasonable consumer rather than on the state of
                        mind or knowledge of the supplier. In this case, the absence of a state of
                        mind requirement gives s 4(<em>a</em>) of the
                        CPFTA a wider ambit than other analogous common law causes of action,
                            <em>viz</em>, fraudulent and negligent
                        misrepresentation, which are founded on the fault of the defendant. That
                        said, while the supplier’s state of mind is not an essential element
                        in the notion of misleading or deceptive conduct, a decision as to whether
                        the supplier’s conduct conveyed a misleading or deceitful meaning may
                        involve consideration of whether the maker of the statement had a particular
                        state of mind when the statement was made (<em>ie</em>,
                        it is probative in establishing whether s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA has been breached).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the emphasis in
                            s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA is on the effect
                        on a reasonable consumer is consistent with Parliament’s underlying
                        philosophy behind the enactment of the CPFTA (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), <em>viz</em>, that there
                        should be a balancing of the interests of consumers against that of
                        businesses and traders. If the emphasis in s 4(<em>a</em>) of the CPFTA was on the effect on <em>any</em> consumer, not only would this be inimical to the
                        principle of <em>caveat emptor</em> emphasised by
                        Parliament, this would also be contrary to its intention in ensuring that
                        “[t]here should be business certainty and not undue costs in
                        complying with [the CPFTA]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     Pursuant to s 5(3)(<em>a</em>)
                        of the CPFTA, it would appear that a supplier who has engaged in an unfair
                        practice may be excused by acting reasonably although the CPFTA offers no
                        guidance as to what is or is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Referee said (at [10] of the GD) that the
                    representation mentioned that Preston University had awarded Dr Chiang the
                    Ph.D in 2004 on his dissertation on options trading. The representation also
                    indicated that the taught method of options trading was designed around his
                    doctorate dissertation. He said (at [11] of the GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Against these assumptions, it is my finding that a
                            reasonable consumer would read the representation to mean

                            Chiang is an academic expert by reason of him possessing a credible PhD
                            from a credible university. Conversely without a credible PhD, Dr.
                            Chiang cannot claim to be an academic expert. Hence, the credibility of
                            his PhD comes into issue.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Referee found (at [12a] of the GD) that a
                    reasonable consumer with the belief that Dr Chiang is an academic expert on
                    options trading would be materially influenced by the representation. He also
                    found (at [13] of the GD) that the representation was misleading. He concluded
                    there was unfair practice on the part of Freely (see [17] of the GD) and, in
                    doing so, he said he considered (at [17] of the GD) whether Freely’s
                    actions were reasonable in the circumstances but did not think that they
                    were.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Yet, Freely submitted that the Referee had
                    erred in law. Freely’s ground was that the test was the reasonableness of
                    its action. While Freely elaborated as to why its conduct was reasonable, this
                    was a question of fact and the Referee did have valid reasons for his
                    conclusion. Therefore, I rejected this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breaches of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Freely also alleged various breaches of
                    natural justice by the Referee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     First, Freely alleged that it had very little
                    time to respond to the claims. On the other hand, the Claimants pointed to a
                    schedule of Freely’s attendances to dispute this. Dr Chiang had
                    attended on three dates of consultation for the claims, <em>ie</em>, 10, 11 and 13 November 2008. Subsequently, a Notice of
                    Hearing dated 26 February 2009 was issued. The Notice stated the hearing to
                    be on 12 March 2009. It was clear to me that given that Dr Chiang had
                    already attended consultation sessions since early November 2008, he had enough
                    time to respond to the claims by 12 March 2009. Moreover, it was undisputed
                    that Freely did not ask for the hearing date to be postponed. The first
                    allegation was without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The second allegation of breach of natural
                    justice was that the Referee had contravened s 28(4) SCTA when he decided
                    not to give copies of the individual statement of evidence from each Claimant to
                    Freely and instead prepared a summary. Section 28(4) SCTA must be read
                    together with s 28(3) SCTA. They state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>28</b>. —(3) A tribunal may, on its own
                        initiative, seek and receive such other evidence and make such other
                        investigations and inquiries as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) All evidence and information received and ascertained by the tribunal
                        under subsection (3) shall be disclosed to every party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As can be seen, s 28(4) was not
                    applicable because it refers to s 28(3) which in turn refers to evidence
                    which an SCT receives from its own initiative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As for the making of a summary, I was of the
                    view that the Referee was entitled to have one prepared and forwarded to the
                    other side under the informal and expeditious process envisaged under the SCTA
                    so long as the summary was an accurate one and Freely knew what it had to
                    respond to. There was no suggestion that it was either an inaccurate summary or
                    a vague one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The third allegation of a breach of natural
                    justice was that the Referee was biased or that there was an appearance of bias
                    when he stated the following in a sarcastic manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">“You’re a
                        celebrity”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">“Your students must have liked you very
                            much”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">“Come on Clemen, you must be smart enough to
                            know…(that Preston University is not
                        accredited)”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">4.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">“Wah…you scored straight As in your
                            PhD transcript”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">addressed to the Respondents present –
                            “so, you just treat this $880 as paid for a lesson on motivation,
                            entertainment, (pause), and options trading”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     There was no verbatim record of the
                    proceedings before the SCTA. However, even if the alleged remarks had been made
                    and had been made sarcastically, which was not necessarily the case, I was of
                    the view that they did not demonstrate bias or gave an impression of bias, even
                    though they would have been inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The next allegation about bias was that the
                    Referee appeared to have made up his mind even before the hearing was concluded
                    as he had a prepared text of his decision thereafter which took him about two
                    hours to read (with translation into Mandarin). Yet, Freely’s counsel
                    accepted that it was not uncommon for a tribunal to prepare a draft text of the
                    decision and amend it, if needs be, as a hearing progresses in the interest of
                    efficiency. That would explain how a tribunal is able to come up with a prepared
                    text soon after a hearing. However, he submitted that this point should not be
                    seen in isolation and, considered together with the other allegations about
                    breaches of natural justice, it demonstrated bias on the part of the Referee. I
                    did not agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having considered all the allegations of such
                    breaches, I was of the view that they were not made out and that there was no
                    bias, apparent or otherwise.</p>

                    full) to another party, the more interesting question, in the context of
                    damages, is what exactly is the measure of these damages? Should a tortious or
                    contractual measure of loss or damages be adopted? Also, must the unfair

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>10.3</b>]    … For the
                            purpose of discussing causation in misleading or deceptive conduct law,
                            it is sufficient to consider briefly the manner in which [the matter has
                            been] approached in analogous common law causes of action, particular
                            deceit and negligent misstatement. <em>Where a number of
                                acts or events have contributed to the loss claimed, the
                                defendant’s fraud or negligence need not be the sole cause of
                                the loss claimed in order for it to be identified as a ‘legal
                                cause from the mass of necessary conditions’. Instead, the
                                relevant question is whether the defendant’s act was a cause
                                of the plaintiff’s loss. Hence, although a plaintiff in deceit
                                or negligent misstatement must prove that ‘he was induced [by
                                the misrepresentation]…to alter his position in a manner
                                affecting his material, temporal or physical interests’ to
                                establish causation, proof that the fraud or negligence was the only

<b>Causation and reliance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>10.8</b>]    As Burchett J has
                            noted, ‘the language of s 52 [of the Australian Trade
                            Practices Act] evokes the question: misled or deceived into what?’
                            The section proscribes conduct having a particular effect upon the
                            mind of its victim, which does not in itself constitute loss or damage.
                            Rather, damage will be suffered by action or inaction under the
                            influence of the error induced by the breach. Hence, in <em>Wardley Australia Ltd v WA</em> [(1992)
                            175 CLR 514], Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ
                            commented that where misleading conduct consists of a misrepresentation,
                            ‘as at common law, acts done by the representee in reliance on the
                            misrepresentation constitute a sufficient connexion to satisfy the
                            concept of causation’ for s 82 [of the Australian Trade
                            Practices Act] purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clearly, then, establishing reliance is a means of proof of causation in
                        the [Australian Trade Practices Act] setting. Nevertheless, some doubt
                        remains as to whether reliance must be proved to establish causation under
                        the [Australian Trade Practices Act]. There are no reported misleading
                        conduct decisions in which causation has been established without proof of
                        reliance, but there seems to be no objection in principle to the proposition
                        that reliance, although ‘plainly sufficient to support the necessary
                        causal connexion between conduct and loss…is not…a necessary
                        element’ of causation under the [Australian Trade Practices Act]. The
                        issue awaits further consideration by the courts in novel fact settings. It
                        is also noteworthy that immediately after the statement quoted above from
                        Wardley, their Honours remarked that if acts of reliance ‘result in
                        economic loss…that economic loss will ordinarily be recoverable under
                        s 82(1) [of the Australian Trade Practices Act]’, which suggests
                        that proof of reliance alone will not establish causation in that setting.
                        The court must also be satisfied that the loss or damage claimed resulted
                        from the acts done in reliance on the conduct.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court has a discretion as to whether or not to grant
                        relief. However, to qualify for an award of damages under s 43(1) and
                        (2) [of the New Zealand Fair Trading Act 1986] the plaintiffs must show
                        that the loss or damage claimed was caused by Connell Wagner’s
                        misconduct. This causal link between conduct and loss is often found where a
                        plaintiff has acted in reliance on a representation made to the plaintiff by
                        the defendant. However, in <em>Commerce Commission v Bennett

                        absence of reliance does not necessarily mean a link does not exits. In
                        delivering the judgment the Court of Appeal, McKay J stated at (a

                            deceptive conduct, the need for a causal link would obviously be
                            satisfied if a person to whom the representation was made relied upon it
                            and suffered loss in consequence. The Judge found that this was not
                            alleged in the present case. With respect, however, it does not follow
                            that the representation could not, as such, have caused the loss.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the recent decision of <em>David v TFAC Ltd</em> [2009] 3 NZLR 239 , the New Zealand
                    Court of Appeal considered the elements required to establish that the conduct
                    in question was “misleading or deceptive” under s 9 of the
                    New Zealand Fair Trading Act 1986 and stated at [40]-[41] that the critical
                    question was whether there was misleading or deceptive conduct that caused the
                    loss suffered by the plaintiff. It cited <em>AMP Finance New
                        Zealand Ltd v Heaven</em> (1997) 8 TCLR 144 at 152 where the
                    Court of Appeal stated that whether there was such conduct should be determined
                    by asking whether:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the conduct at issue was capable of being
                            misleading;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff was in fact misled;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have been
                            misled.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     What then is the position in Singapore? I
                    accepted that the unfair practice need not be the sole cause of the loss or
                    damage. As for reliance, s 6 SCTA is worded differently from s 82(1)
                    of the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974. The latter provides that,
                    “A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that
                    was done in contravention … may recover the amount of the loss or damage
                    by action…”. Section 6 SCTA does not refer to loss or damage
                    “by conduct of another person”. It simply states and I reiterate,
                    “A consumer who has entered a consumer transaction involving an unfair
                    practice may commence an action …”. From a literal interpretation,
                    there is no suggestion that the consumer needs to establish that the unfair
                    practice caused him to enter into the transaction. Section 35(1) SCTA which
                    is the provision on the orders which an SCT may make does not take the matter
                    further. The Referee said (at [8(e)] of the GD) that Chandran suggests that
                    reliance is only relevant in so far as it forms part of the court’s
                    inquiry under the objective test at the liability stage (<em>ie</em>, the question being whether a reasonable consumer would have
                    relied on the representation to make the contract). The Referee concluded (at
                    [20(a)] of the GD) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The Respondent says that the Claimants signed up
                            for the Course based on their interest in the subject and not because of
                            the PhD. As the law stands, this is not a defence. In any event, I have
                            already decided that the Claimants were in fact influenced by the
                            representation to enter into the Contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The situations under which a claim may be made
                    under the SCTA are diverse. Nevertheless, I was of the view that, generally
                    speaking, it is not sufficient to show that a reasonable consumer would have
                    relied on the representation. A claimant must also show that he did rely on the
                    representation. For example, he cannot claim relief under s 6 CPFTA if he
                    was not even aware of the representation or thought nothing of it. Otherwise the
                    balance would tilt too much in favour of consumers. Accordingly, I am of the
                    view that the Referee erred when he said that it was not a defence to say that
                    the Claimants did not sign up for the Course because of the Ph.D. Nevertheless,
                    this was not a ground of appeal, presumably because he nevertheless concluded
                    that the Claimants were in fact influenced by the representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I pause here to caution that this is one
                    aspect of a class action that requires attention. An SCT should be careful and
                    consider whether each and every claimant relied on a representation. While this
                    may make an SCT hearing more tedious, it is a route that must be travelled. This
                    may well be part of the reasons why an SCT is not suited to hear a class action,
                    especially of one involving allegations of misrepresentation, but I need not say
                    more for now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     While Freely did not raise the absence of
                    reliance as a ground of appeal, one of its other grounds was that the Referee
                    was incorrect in concluding that there was no price benefit to the Claimants in
                    purchasing the Software. Freely submitted that the correct test was whether the
                    Software was worth more than the price at which it was sold, <em>ie</em>, $960 and not whether the software was worth the $16,000 that
                    Dr Chiang had mentioned the usual price of the Software to be. I did not
                    agree with Freely. Dr Chiang had suggested that the usual price for the
                    Software was $16,000. This was shown to be untrue. This was an unfair practice
                    (see also para 7 of the Second Schedule of the CPFTA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I now move on to examine the appropriate
                    measure of damages to be awarded where there is an unfair practice and
                    reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Chandran suggests, pointing to Australian and
                    New Zealand decisions in support, that the correct measure to be adopted is the
                    tortious measure of damages. That this is the appropriate measure of damages
                    under the CPFTA was also accepted by the Referee (see [8(f)-(g)] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In this vein, <em>Lockhart</em> makes the following observations, at pp 333-335,
                    on the tortious measure of damages (footnotes omitted):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3    ‘THE AMOUNT OF LOSS OR
                            DAMAGE’</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>A general measure?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>11.17</b>]    The only express
                            reference in s 82 [of the Australian Trade Practices Act]…to
                            the quantum of damages recoverable by a victim of misleading conduct is
                            that the award must be for the ‘amount of loss or damage’
                            suffered by the proscribed conduct. Consequently, whilst emphasising
                            that the assessment of [Australian Trade Practices Act] damages is
                            essentially a question of statutory construction which is not
                            necessarily confined by general law rules, <em>the courts
                                have generally turned to analogous causes of action in tort for
                                guidance regarding the quantification of loss in claims based on
                                misleading conduct. The analogy which has been most commonly invoked
                                for that purpose is the measure of damages where deceit has induced
                                entry into a contract which remains on foot. In that context, a rule
                                of practice operates by which the difference between the value of
                                what has been purchased and what was paid is awarded and the rule
                                has also been said to operate in similar claims based on misleading
                                conduct</em>. The rule seemingly also applies where the breach
                            has induced the sale of an asset at below market value. <em>Similarly, it has been suggested that where a breach has
                                induced entry by a developer into a building contract the price paid
                                less the value obtained is the ordinary measure of damages. In
                                [Australian Trade Practices Act] law, as in deceit, however, the
                                rule is a ‘starting point but not necessarily the finishing
                                point] of the assessment and does not preclude the recovery of other
                                losses that ‘flowed directly’ from the wrongful
                                conduct…</em></p>

                            contravention. Accordingly, the loss of damage suffered in such cases
                            will usually be measured by simply quantifying the loss which flowed

                        immediate and direct consequential losses caused by the respondent’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For the same reasons offered by Chandran and
                        <em>Lockhart</em>, I accepted that the appropriate
                    measure of damages under the CPFTA for loss or damage which arises from unfair
                    practice is, generally, the tortious measure of damages, <em>viz</em>, the difference between the value of what has been purchased
                    and what was paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Course</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the present instance, the Referee
                    calculated the measure of damages in respect of the Course in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em><u>(1) Course Contract</u></em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    In the circumstances, the correct measure of
                            damages in respect of the Course Contract would be the price paid less
                            the price of an equivalent options trading course conducted by a
                            credible institution (without the hypnotheraphy and motivational
                            components).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Under section 28(3) and (4) [SCTA], a
                            tribunal may, on its own initiative, seek and receive such other
                            evidence and make sure other investigations and inquiries as it thinks
                            fit provided all such evidence and information received is disclosed to
                            every party. I have therefore investigated what credible options trading
                            courses are available in the market. The most reasonable of which is a
                            seminar conducted by the local Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
                            Incidentally, Dr. Chiang mentioned that this course is conduced by 2 of
                            his ex-students who do not possess PhDs in options trading. This
                            therefore gives me some indication as to how much a pared-down version
                            of the Respondent’s curriculum is worth in the
                        market.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The NTU course is priced at $590 for the public
                            for 2 full days (or $295 per day). I have adopted this public rate
                            rather than the subsidised rate enjoyed by NTU members. I would also
                            give the Respondent an extra day’s credit in recognition of their
                            higher overhead costs in comparison to NTU. Using this guide, I hereby
                            award damages to the Claimants at a sum equal to price paid less ($295 x
                            3 days at $885). This computation I think best serves the interests of
                            justice in a Small Claims proceedings where the tribunal is not bound by
                            strict rules of evidence and can inform itself on any matter in such
                            manner as it thinks fit: section 28(1) [SCTA].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     As may be seen, the method of calculation of
                    damages adopted by the Referee, <em>viz</em>, price
                    actually paid for the Course less the actual value of the Course accords with
                    the tortious measure of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Software and Webinar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The “unfair practice” in
                    relation to the Software and Webinar was expressed by the Referee in the
                    following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>Software and Webinar Contracts</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    The unfair practice in respect of the PhD also

                            Contracts. Additionally, I detected the presence of another unfair
                            practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    [Freely] claimed that the Software had an original
                            value of $16,000 but was on offer for $960. Under s 4(d) [of the
                            CPFTA] read with paragraph 7 of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            Schedule, the representation that a price benefit exists where it
                            actually does not, constitutes an unfair practice. I asked [Freely]to
                            explain why he [<em>ie</em>, Dr Chiang]
                            claimed the Software was worth $16,000. His answers were vague and
                            indeterminate, leading me to conclude that the purported value of
                            $16,000 was fictitious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    He claimed to have offered the Software for sale
                            at $16,000 to financial institutions but have never sold one at that
                            price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    To justify the value at $16,000, he included the
                            value of past video recordings of his Webinars at $1500 to $2000 but
                            admitted that the [respondents] would not be able to view those past
                            recordings even though they purchased the Software.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    He even ascribed a value of US$1,500 to the very
                            instructions on how to use the Software.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the present instance, the Referee had
                    calculated the measure of damages in respect of the Software and the Webinar
                    Contracts in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    
              <em><u>Software Contract and Webinar
                                Contract</u></em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    In respect of these contracts, the products are
                            still substantially intact. These are essentially licenses given to the
                            [Respondents] to use software or web platforms. All expenses incurred by
                            the Respondent in producing the Software and Webinar are essentially
                            overhead costs incurred prior to the sale of those products. In other
                            words, those expenses were business costs that the Respondent would
                            have…expended regardless whether they sold any Software or
                            Webinar. Although there is a CD given for the Software Contract and
                            hardcopies of course materials furnished, I do not see any bars to a
                            full refund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In calculating the amount of damages in
                    relation to the Software and the Webinar, the tortious measure of damages was
                    not explicitly referred to by the Referee. Was the full refund ordered by the
                    Referee then in accordance with the tortious measure of damages? With regard to
                    the Software, it would appear from the respondents’ evidence on record
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no technical
                            support<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     many respondents could not log on to the
                            website<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     the password was only given to the students on
                        17 May 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These factors, in
                    addition to the Claimants’ evidence (see [7(b)] of the Summary of
                    Claimants’ Statement of Facts at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above) that all or most information contained in the Software was <em>freely available</em> on the Internet as they were links to
                    online websites (which was not disputed by Freely), all mean that the actual
                    value of the Software, which some of the respondents had purchased for S$960,
                    was negligible. In accordance with the tortious measure of damages, this
                    effectively translates to a full refund of the price actually paid for the
                    Software.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     With regard to the Webinar, the evidence on
                    record was that it was <em>only</em> for three
                        views<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. It was also
                    undisputed by Freely that after the Straits Times report was published, Freely
                    stopped sending the Claimants (who had purchased the Webinar) materials and
                    sessions on the Webinar (see [7(c)] of the Summary of Claimants’ Statement
                    of Facts at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). In these
                    circumstances, as with the Software, the actual value of the Webinar was
                    negligible. In accordance with the tortious measure of damages, this effectively
                    translates to a full refund of the price actually paid for the
                Webinar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On the issue of damages in respect of the
                    Course, Freely submitted that the Referee had adduced evidence of his own
                    investigation of a 2-day course on options trading without giving Freely an
                    opportunity to address such evidence, contrary to s 28(4) SCTA which I have
                    set out above (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>). However, the notes
                    of evidence showed that the Referee did raise such evidence with Dr Chiang.
                    Furthermore, it was for Dr Chiang to adduce his own evidence on the issue
                    of the quantum of damages, without prejudice to Freely’s denial of
                    liability, but he did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As for damages for the Software, Freely
                    submitted that there should only be minimal damages but did not show how the
                    Referee had erred in law in his decision to order a full refund. There was also
                    inadequate elaboration as to why the damages should be nominal. I rejected this
                    ground of appeal as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no reason
                    to disturb the Referee’s decision against Freely.</p>
