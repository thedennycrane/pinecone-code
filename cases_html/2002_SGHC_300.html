<p align="justify" xmlns="">HELD, JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFFS :</p>
<p xmlns="">(1)    It was not possible to identify any illegality. The sanctity

of a contract freely entered into should not be invalidated without good legal reason.

Where the doctrine of public policy is invoked, there is a need for the court to be

circumspect. In this case, even though the subletting was done without the approval of JTC

and there was subletting of open space, nevertheless, JTC was not without its remedies.

However, instead of exercising its rights, JTC had chosen to give all concerned time to

unscramble. The court would decline from venturing into the proper province of public

policy in relation to subletting of industrial properties in respect of which JTC is,

professionally and administratively, the best statutory agency to make the calls of

judgment (See [10]-[16]).</p>
<p xmlns="">(2)    The preponderance of documentary evidence supported the

plaintiffs’ claim for the licensing fees. The plaintiffs’ claims for

reimbursement of the costs for the removal of the debris were also allowed as the hardcore

debris were incontestably left behind by the sub-tenants of the defendants and there was

evidence to show that it was the defendants and/or their sub-tenants and not the

plaintiffs who were responsible for the clearance of the debris. On the other hand, the

evidence demonstrated that the expenses claimed by the defendants under the Management

Agreement were actually incurred by and for the benefit of the defendants themselves and

hence, their claims for such expenses were rejected (See [18]-[20]).</p>
<p xmlns="">(3)    The Licensing Agreement had provided for its termination on the

expiry of 4 months’ notice. In this case, the defendants<b> </b>were given ample

notice and they had, in fact, more than the 4 months to vacate. They did not suffer any

damages and accepted the notice to vacate because they were fully aware that that was the

requirement of JTC. The plaintiffs were, therefore, not in repudiation of the Licensing

Agreement (See [21]-[24]).<b></b></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The sawmills in the Sungei Kadut area, each of

which occupied more than 4 acres of valuable industrial land, became a sunset industry.

After they stopped sawmilling and carpentry operations, they sublet their premises. In

this case, the problems were compounded by partnership disputes. The plaintiffs therefore

licensed a substantial part of their property to the defendants so that the latter could

in turn sub-licence to third parties. They also engaged the defendants to manage their

business, which was principally sub-lettings to their own sub-tenants. As will be seen,

the arrangements have spawn this piece of litigation. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        In this action, the plaintiff partnership, for

which a Receiver and Manager was appointed by Order of Court made on 25 September 1998,

claim from the defendants the sum of $912,154.25 or such other sum that may be found to be

due for the balance of the monthly fee payable to the plaintiffs by the defendants for the

use of the woodworking factory area and the open space area for the period between 13

February 1997 to 11 February 1999. According to the plaintiffs the gross licensing fee was

$1,753,428.60 and they gave credit to the defendants for the payment of $841,274.35

already made. They further claim the sum of $198,631.08 due from the defendants to the

plaintiffs for the expenses incurred by the Receiver for the dismantling of the

unauthorised structures and for the removal of the debris from the plaintiffs’

premises. They also claim interest on all moneys found to be due to the plaintiffs at the

rate of 6% per annum from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment and

costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        According to the defence, the gross licensing

fee for the period of 2 years should be $1,184, 437.20 and not the sum of $1,753,428.60 as

the plaintiffs have alleged. The defendants further claim that under another agreement

they had with the plaintiffs, namely the Management Agreement, they were entrusted with

the management of the property and they claim the expenses of $589,497.18 which are

particularised in exhibit P2 and elaborated in exhibits D2 and D3. All three exhibits were

documents in the nature of Scott’s Schedule which I had directed to be prepared for

ease of reference. They were schedules of items, the amounts, the grounds why the

plaintiffs have rejected them and the reasons which the defendants rely on in support of

their claims for reimbursements. Thirdly, and finally, the defendants counterclaim

liquidated damages in the sum of $944,524.20 which they allegedly suffered by reason of

the plaintiffs’ wrongful termination and repudiation of the licensing agreement.

Alternatively, the defendants seek the entry of an interlocutory judgement for wrongful

repudiation and for damages to be assessed by the Registrar. I now turn to the background.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The plaintiffs were at all material times the

lessees of the industrial premises at No. 44, Sungei Kadut Street, Singapore ("the

premises") of which the lessor was the Jurong Town Corporation ("JTC").

They were a partnership firm dealing in, until the events hereinafter recited, sawmilling

and carpentry works. The partnership encountered partnership disputes and they were

dissolved by an Order of Court on 25 September 1998 and Mr Don Ho Mun-Tuke ("Mr Don

Ho") was appointed the Receiver and Manager. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        Sometime in early 1997, the defendants, which

were associated with one of the partners by ties of kinship, were invited by the

plaintiffs to help manage the premises. This was necessary because the partners were at

loggerheads and matters of the firm suffered. Matters deteriorated, arrears of rent from

their subtenants mounted and the premises were left in a state of disrepair. The

plaintiffs granted a licence to the defendants to use a substantial portion of the

premises for differentiated monthly licence fees and they also appointed the defendants to

run the business of the plaintiffs, which was then solely the business of subletting, and

to maintain the premises, keeping them in a state of tenantable repair.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The Licensing Agreement ("the Licensing

Agreement") was entered into under an agreement dated 13 February 1997. Under it, the

defendants agreed to use up to 30,000 square feet of the woodworking factory area

("the woodworking area") and up to 100,000 square feet of the open space area

("the open space area") for a period of sixty (60) months with effect from 13

February, 1997, expiring on 12 February 2002. Both areas were delineated in a plan. The

monthly licence fee for the woodworking area was $1.20 per square foot and for the open

space area was 60 cts per square foot. The Licensing Agreement conferred on the defendants

the right to sub-license their portion of the premises to third parties. A schedule of the

defendants’ various sub-licensees is attached to the affidavit evidence in chief of

Mr Lim Lung Tieng.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        It was also agreed that the defendants were to

pay to the plaintiffs all utilities charges by meter reading promptly on demand upon

presentation of the invoices for the same by the plaintiffs to the defendants. That was

because the plaintiffs continued to pay for the utilities to the Public Utilities Board. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        There was a termination clause. Under it, the

defendants or the plaintiffs were entitled to give the other party four (4) months’

notice in the event that either party wished to terminate the Licence Agreement and in the

event the plaintiffs were to terminate the Licence Agreement upon giving the requisite

four (4) months’ notice, the defendants were allowed to use and occupy the

woodworking and open space areas without the need to pay the plaintiffs the monthly

service and supervision fee during the notice period. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        By the Management Agreement between the parties

hereto and dated 30 March, 1997 the defendants agreed to assist the plaintiffs in carrying

out various matters in relation to the maintenance of the premises and the running of the

plaintiffs’ business. The relevant portion of the Management Agreement stated:</font></p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Preliminary Issue</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        At the beginning of the trial, I acceded to the

joint application of both counsel that I address a preliminary question. I was told and I

was of the same view, having read the trial papers in advance, that the determination of

the preliminary question would save a considerable amount of time. The preliminary

question was whether the plaintiffs’ claim for the sum of $912,154.25 allegedly due

under the Licensing Agreement and the defendants’ counterclaim for repudiatory breach

of it ought to be dismissed because the Licensing Agreement is unenforceable. Initially,

the defendants relied on two grounds for unenforceability, namely illegality and public

policy. The Jurong Town Corporation Act (Cap. 150) ("the Act") did not

criminalise or even prohibit subletting of industrial properties under JTC leases or

licence, unlike the case of subletting of residential properties under JTC leases is

unlawful under section 51 read with section 36 of the Act. It was not possible to identify

any illegality. Therefore public policy remained as the sole ground for unenforceability.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        For the purposes of the preliminary question,

some further facts were agreed. Under the then applicable JTC guidelines, the subletting

of JTC land and industrial building was subject to the approval of JTC and the relevant

Government authorities. A party applying for approval was required to pay to JTC a

subletting fee and administrative fee. The application would have to be completed by both

the lessee/applicant and the proposed sub-tenant and submitted by the lessee/applicant to

JTC. Under the JTC 21 Policy, which came into force in or about August 1997, the

subletting of open land was not allowed. It was also common ground that no application for

approval was submitted to JTC in respect of the Licensing Agreement. The Licensing

Agreement included open space.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        It was submitted on behalf of the defendants

that it would be contrary to public policy to allow the claim. He relied on the agreed

facts which established that JTC, the principal engine for industrial development in

Singapore, did not permit the subletting of open space and did not permit any subletting

without its prior approval. But JTC was not without its remedies. The lease prohibited

subletting and JTC had its rights, including the rights of forfeiture. For reasons of good

industrial and sensitive management, they elected to give all concerned time to

unscramble. It was fully aware of the subletting but it allowed them sufficient time for

arrangements to be made to enable unauthorised sub-tenants to find alternative premises.

For myself, I would decline from venturing into the proper province of public policy in

relation to subletting of industrial properties in respect of which JTC is professionally

and administratively, armed with all relevant data and institutional knowledge and staffed

by experienced officers, the best statutory agency to make the calls of judgment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The sanctity of a contract freely entered into

should not be invalidated without good legal reason. Where the doctrine of public policy

is invoked, there is a need to be circumspect for under its guise courts may rush in where

angels fear to tread. There are a number of reported cases where public policy has been

shown to be an unruly horse. In this connection, the following dicta of Asquith LJ in <i>Monkland

v Jack Barclay, Ltd</i> [1951] 1 All ER 714, at p 723A is helpful: "Certain specific

cases of contracts have been ruled by authority to be contrary to the policy of the law,

which is, of course, not the same thing as the policy of the government, whatever its

complexion-e.g., marriage brokerage contracts, contracts for the sale of honours,

contracts in restraint of trade and so on. The courts have again and again said that,

where a contract does not fit into one or other of these pigeon-holes but lies outside

this charmed circle, the courts should use extreme reserve in holding a contract to be

void as against public policy, and should only do so when the contract is incontestably

and on any view inimical to the public interest:…".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        The defendants rely on <i>Tan Seng Huat v

Golden Seal Pte Ltd</i> [Suit No. 1632 of 1996]. The decision of the High Court was

delivered on 30 April 1998. It is not reported. The High Court in that case dismissed the

plaintiffs’ claim for vacant possession of their JTC factory, reinstatement costs and

mesne profits and at the same time dismissed the counterclaim of the defendants for

damages resulting from the plaintiffs’ breach of an alleged tenancy agreement. The

High Court noted that both parties were aware that JTC approval to sublet had not been

obtained and that they had taken the risks of moving into the premises anyway. According

to the High Court, neither party deserved the Court’s sympathy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        At para 56 of the judgment, which dealt with a

whole hosts of other facts not relevant for present purposes, the Court stated:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Consequently, the plaintiff

    is not entitled to the reliefs he has claimed against Golden Seal nor Golden Seal to its

    counterclaim. The profit should not profit from Golden Seal’s occupation of the

    premises and neither should Golden Seal be reimbursed any of its costs and consequential

    loss in moving into and then out, of the factory; both sides were equally blameworthy-they

    were aware of and took the risk of Golden Seal’s moving in without the blessings of

    the JTC and without TOP; neither deserve the Court’s sympathy".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        The reasoning in terms and in language was not

grounded on public policy. I am not sure that there was an explicit ruling that the

contract of sub-tenancy was contrary to public policy. If public policy was the ground for

not enforcing the rights of the parties in the claims and counter-claim, I am ineluctably

driven to say that the scope of public policy invalidating the sub-contract cannot go that

far. It was an extension of public policy which, for my own part, I would not make. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The claims and counterclaims</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        Before I deal with the claims and

counterclaims, I should recite the facts as gleaned from the evidence of the witnesses.

Though Mr Don Ho had come upon the scene after his appointment as the receiver and

manager, he attended the premises immediately after his appointment. The plaintiffs had

ceased sawmilling and carpentry business. He ascertained that the gross area of the

premises was 400,000 square feet. The defendants were in occupation and use of the whole

of the woodworking factory area and the open space within the plaintiffs’ premises

from 13 February until 27 September 1999. A small number of the subtenants of the

plaintiffs remained. On 27 September 1999 the defendants delivered possession of the

plaintiffs’ premises to Mr Don Ho in response to his demands to vacate and deliver up

vacant possession after JTC had set the deadline. In the correspondence it was very clear

that JTC had required the plaintiffs to remove all the sub-tenants. It was very clear from

the evidence and correspondence disclosed in 2AB384, 391, 402 to 405 and 418 <i>that the

defendants in truth and in fact were given and had taken about 8 months to deliver vacant

possession which was required by JTC. </i>After they had left, the premises were sold by

Mr Don Ho. The plaintiffs sold their residue of 6 years interest in the JTC leasehold.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        I now turn to the plaintiffs’ claim for

the monthly licence fees. According to Mr Don Ho he had perused copies of the documents,

including the warehousing agreements which the defendants had entered with various other

sub-sub licencees. He was able to ascertain that the monthly fees payable to the

plaintiffs by the defendants for their use and occupation of the premises was

$1,753,428.60. He prepared a spreadsheet from the documents produced by the defendants

during the discovery process. It is marked DHMT-1 and appeared as Schedule A annexed to

the RE-Amended Statement of Claim. His evidence was not dented in cross examination. Mr

Lim Lung Tieng gave evidence for the defendants. He said that the defendants’ monthly

statements were furnished to the receiver and manager. He disclosed that the defendants

earned a gross profit of $31,484.14 per month on the basis of the highest occupancy rate.

That highest occupancy rate occurred during the latter part of 1998. I should be noted

that the management lasted from February 1997 to September 1999. The preponderance of the

documentary evidence support the plaintiffs’ claim for the licensing fees. I reject

the defendants assertion that the gross licensing fees were less.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        I next turn to the defendants’ claims for

deduction of expenses from the amounts they had to pay the plaintiffs. The expenses were

said to total $589,497.18 less some items which the parties had expressly agreed before

me. The plaintiffs prepared the Schedule of Disputed claims where they set out their

reasons for rejecting the claims. The schedule is marked as exhibit P2. In my judgment,

based on the totality of the evidence, it was demonstrated by the plaintiffs all expenses

were actually incurred by and for the benefit of the defendants. The reasons are all set

out in the third column of exhibit P2. I need not repeat them. The defendants’ claims

for the so-called expenses are therefore rejected, save for those which the plaintiffs

have agreed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are

liable to pay to them the debris disposal charges which they had paid to remove them. They

totalled $198,631.08. The hardcore debris were incontestably left behind by the

sub-tenants of the defendants. There were photographs showing the debris. They were left

behind by Hong Wee Construction Pte Ltd ("Hong Wee"). Mr Kelvin Lim, a witness

for the defendants, explained that Hong Wee was the sub-tenants of Hean Nerng Holdings Pte

Ltd ("HNH"). HNH was a related company of the defendants. Mr Kelvin Lim in cross

examination admitted that the defendants were responsible to clear the debris left behind

by their sub-tenants. He said Hong Wee had wanted to re-cycle the debris but did not do

so. In fact, HNH had sued Hong Wee in the Subordinate Courts for the self-same costs for

the removal of the debris. Another witness of the defendants, Mr Lim Heng Choon, told the

court that it was the defendants and/or their sub-tenants and not the plaintiffs who were

responsible for the clearance of the debris left behind by the defendants’

sub-tenants. I therefore allow plaintiffs’ claims for reimbursement of the costs for

the removal of the debris.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        I turn to what is superficially a substantial

counterclaims of the defendants for damages by reason of the wrongful repudiation of the

Licence Agreement. They in effect counterclaim for loss of profits for the residue of the

Licence Agreement of 2 years and 6 months. The first matter to note is that the Licence

Agreement provided for its termination on the expiry of the 4 months’ notice.

Further, the defendants continued to enjoy the premises for 8 months before they vacated

in September 1999. In fact, the defendants knew full well that JTC wanted the clearance of

the site of all authorised sub-tenants. They left without any demur.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        In <i>Gunton v Richmond-Upon-Thames London

Borough Council</i> [1981] 1 WLR 448 the plaintiff was dismissed without compliance with a

contractually binding procedure. The damages to be assessed was only up to the expiry of

the contractually due notice of one month notionally served on the day when the proper

disciplinary procedure, if followed, could have been concluded. Again, this rule was

previously invoked by the Privy Council in <i>British Guiana Credit Corporation v Da Silva</i>

[1965] 1 WLR 248. The respondent was offered employment by the appellant as their general

manager under a 6 year contract (though a 3 year contract was found on appeal) and in

either case, the contract was terminable upon 6 months’ notice. The appellant

repudiated the contract and the respondent sued for damages. The Privy Council concluded

that the claim for damages should be limited to 6 months. The Gunton’s rule is

consistent with principle. To rule otherwise would render otiose the earlier termination

clause. It is not permissible to ignore the clear bargains in a contract. Counsel for the

defendants in his response filed in court by way of his letter of 19 November 2002

submitted that in <i>British Guiana Credit Corporation</i> there was no express term that

the contract of service could be terminated by 6 months’ notice. In my view, this was

immaterial to the principle of assessment of damages. The controversy in that case, where

the respondent was appointed but yet did not take office before his dismissal, proceeded

on the basis that it was contemplated by both parties that there would be a termination

clause. The negotiations contemplated the finalisation of the terms of contract. As for

what was the reasonable period, the respondent himself had suggested 6 months in one of

the documents. The ruling was that damages would be for the period of the notice if one

had been given in accordance with the contract. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        The defendants rely on <i>In re London and

Colonial Company Ex parte Clark</i> [L.R.] 7 Eq 550. It was submitted that the fact that a

fixed term contract was terminable by notice does not ipso facto bar the innocent party

from claiming damages in relation to the unexpired term of the agreement. The court ruled,

it was pointed out, that Mr Clark was entitled to his salary for the remaining period of

his service agreement and not just for the 6 months’ period. In that case, the

contract between the limited trading company and Mr Clark was that he as an agent would be

paid a salary of oe750 a year for a period of 5 years from the day of his arrival at the

colony. In addition, he was to be allowed certain commission on remittances in money or

produce which should be made by him to England. Mr Clark was to pay up at once oe2 per

share of fifty shares of oe100 each, which he had been required to take up in the company,

and the company agreed from time to time to place oe8 per share, as well as all other sums

that might become due from the agent, to his debit on account of the calls to be made to

him on the shares. It is clear that this was an agency agreement coupled with a separate

share subscription agreement involving part paid shares with calls upon the agent from

time to time during the period of the appointment. That case is miles away from the

instant case. Although the reasons were not altogether transparent in the report, it seems

to me the contract required Mr Clark to be paid the full salary to enable him to pay on

the calls for the shares. Accordingly, the case does not assist the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        In my view, the defendants were given ample

notice and they had more than the 4 months to vacate. They did not suffer any damages.

They were quite happy to vacate. They accepted the notice to vacate because they were

fully aware that that was the requirement of JTC. The plaintiffs were not in repudiation

of the Licence Agreement. Finally, I accept the contention of the plaintiffs that if there

was any repudiatory breach on their part the same had been waived by the conduct of the

defendants. They had accepted the situation and they left, though they did so only after 8

months without any demur or protest whatsoever.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        In the premises, there will be judgment for the

plaintiffs as claimed. The claims of set-off and counterclaims of the defendants are

dismissed with costs. The parties are directed to settle the Order and submit the same for

my approval.</font></p>
