        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The matter before us concerned a criminal
                    reference that had been taken out by the Public Prosecutor (“the
                    Applicant”) pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”). The genesis of this
                    application was the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”)
                    setting aside the conviction of Rangasamy Subramaniam (“the
                    Respondent”) under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the RTA”) for
                    driving while under the influence of drink (see <em>Rangasamy
                        Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] 1 SLR(R) 719
                    (“the GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Before proceeding to consider the question
                    reserved for our decision in the present application, it would be appropriate
                    that we first set out briefly the specific background of the case. The facts
                    were relatively straightforward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 2 December 2007, at about 10.00pm, the
                    Respondent went to a coffee shop at Tanjong Pagar. He claimed that he drank a
                    bottle of beer which he finished by 11.00pm but that he remained at the coffee
                    shop for a while thereafter. The Respondent admitted that on 3 December
                    2007, at about 2.00am, he got into his car and started to drive
                        home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, whilst
                    travelling along the Pan-Island Expressway (“the PIE”), he felt
                    sleepy and nauseous. After stopping his car at the road shoulder, he fell asleep
                    in his car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At 3.54am, the police received a telephone call
                    from someone who stated that “there is a car parked on the PIE with the
                    driver’s door open and he is partially coming out of the
                        car”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The police despatched a patrol car to
                    the scene where they found the Respondent. His speech was found to be slurred
                    and his eyes were bloodshot. Consequently, at 4.42am, the police proceeded to
                    administer a breathalyser test on him. He failed the test and was
                    arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent was then brought back to the
                    Traffic Police Division Headquarters where a breath evidential analyser
                    (“BEA”) test was administered on him at 5.42am pursuant to
                    s 70(1) of the RTA. His breath alcohol content was found to be
                    43 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml of breath, which was above the
                    legal limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 ml of breath. Both
                    the breathalyser test and the BEA test were administered on the Respondent more
                    than 2 hours after he had stopped driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The police charged the Respondent for driving
                    while under the influence of drink pursuant to s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA. The charge read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rangasamy Subramaniam</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NRIC No.: S-[xxx]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Male, 56 years old (D.O.B.: 29 Dec 1951)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 3rd day of December 2007, between
                        2 am and 3.54 am, along Pan Island Expressway 14.5 km towards
                        Tuas, Singapore, when driving motor car SGG 4774 D, did have so
                        much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath, to wit,
                        not less than 43 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
                        breath, exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in
                        100 millilitres of breath, and you have thereby committed an offence
                        punishable under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act,
                        Chapter 276.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The police relied on the results of the BEA test and the assumption in
                    s 71A of the RTA to show that the Respondent’s alcohol level exceeded
                    the legal limit at the material time. There was no other evidence of the
                    Respondent’s alcohol level. Section 71A provides that in proceedings
                    for an offence under ss 67 or 68, the proportion of alcohol in an
                    accused’s breath at the time of the alleged offence shall be assumed to be
                    not less than that in the specimen of breath provided by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During trial, counsel for the Respondent
                    submitted that there was no evidence that the Respondent’s alcohol level
                    during the material time (between 2.00am and 3.54am) exceeded the legal limits.
                    He submitted that the assumption in s 71A of the RTA could not apply in the
                    circumstances to show that the Respondent’s alcohol level had exceeded the
                    limit at the material time because by the time the Respondent was found by the
                    police, he was no longer driving. He also invited the court to amend the charge
                    to one under s 68 of the RTA for being in charge of a motor vehicle when
                    under the influence of drink. Significantly, s 68, unlike s 67, does
                    not provide for disqualification from driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The District Judge held that the assumption in
                    s 71A of the RTA applied and convicted the Respondent. She sentenced him to
                    a fine of $3,000 (in default 15 days’ imprisonment) and disqualified
                    him from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles for
                    a period of 2 years (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Rangasamy
                        Subramaniam</em> [2009] SGDC 30). The Respondent appealed
                    against both the conviction and the sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before the Judge, the Respondent again submitted
                    that under the RTA, the assumption in s 71A could only be used in support
                    of a charge under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) if the offender
                    was stopped while he was driving or attempting to drive a vehicle, as opposed to
                    a situation where he was merely in charge of a vehicle within the meaning of
                    s 68. The Judge allowed the appeal. He quashed the Respondent’s
                    conviction with respect to the offence under s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) and set aside the sentence imposed. Instead, he found that
                    there was sufficient evidence of the Respondent having been in charge of a motor
                    vehicle when under the influence of drink. Accordingly, he convicted the
                    Respondent of a lesser charge under s 68(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA and sentenced the Respondent to a fine of $2,000 (in
                    default 10 days’ imprisonment).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> There were two
                    main reasons why the Judge decided to quash the Respondent’s conviction
                    that had been imposed by the District Judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     On a charge under s 68(1) of the
                        RTA for being in charge of a motor vehicle when under the influence of
                        drink, it was open to the accused (here, the Respondent) to prove the
                        circumstances in s 68(2) of the RTA, <em>viz</em>,
                        that at the time he was driving the vehicle, his alcohol level was not over
                        the limit, even though by operation of s 71A(1) of the RTA, his alcohol
                        level at the time he was apprehended would be assumed to be not less than
                        the level found in the specimen given by him. If s 71A(1) of the RTA
                        were applicable to a charge under s 67(1) of the RTA in the
                        circumstances of the present case, the accused would be deprived of the
                        defence available to him under s 68(2) if he had been charged under
                        s 68(1) of the RTA instead (see the GD at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     If s 71A(1) of the RTA was
                        applicable where a person, apprehended while he was in charge of a vehicle
                        (as opposed to while he was driving it), is charged with an offence under
                        s 67(1) of the RTA, then it would mean that he was better off refusing
                        to provide a breath or blood specimen. That was because without the result
                        from the specimen, that person could only be convicted of an offence under
                        s 68(1) of the RTA as opposed to the more severe offence under
                        s 67(1) of the RTA (see the GD at [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Following the decision of the Judge, the
                    Applicant applied by way of Criminal Motion for a question of law of public
                    interest to be referred to us. The question was phrased as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether the assumption under Section 71A of the Road Traffic Act
                        applies to an accused charged under Section 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Road Traffic Act where the accused was not driving
                        a vehicle at the time of the arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary objection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his Statement of Case, the Judge expressed
                    his view that the true question that arose from his decision was, instead, more
                    appropriately phrased as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hether the assumption under s 71A of the Road Traffic Act
                        (“RTA”) applies to an accused person charged under
                            s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA where he was
                        arrested in circumstances under which a charge of s 68(1) of the RTA
                        was made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, as the Applicant was not inclined to alter the question, and
                    as s 60 of the SCJA required the court to certify any application by the
                    Public Prosecutor, the Judge made an order in terms in relation to the motion
                    and reserved the question (as set out in the preceding paragraph) for
                    determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Respondent submitted, as a preliminary
                    point, that the question posed by Applicant ought to be rephrased in accordance
                    with the Judge’s wording (see above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>) or as a question of whether, given facts such as those in
                    the present case, s 67 or s 68 of the RTA was the more appropriate
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The principles governing the refashioning of a
                    question posed in a criminal reference were set out in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Fernandez Joseph Ferdinent</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 1 as follows (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] refashioning of a question being posed by an applicant to this court
                        in a criminal reference is neither novel nor inappropriate. The overriding
                        task of this court in any criminal reference is to clarify questions of law
                        of public interest. It should not be forgotten that the primary objective of
                        such a process is to allow this court an opportunity to provide an
                        authoritative articulation of the applicable principles for future cases.
                        This purpose would undoubtedly be frustrated if this court is compelled to
                        decide on questions that may be of insignificant utility as a result of the
                        use of inappropriate nomenclature by an applicant. For that reason, where a
                        question is couched in a manner which would inadvertently mask its true
                        import… the court retains a discretion to pose the question in a
                        manner which will be more appropriate and which will ensure that the
                        substance of the question is rendered clear, save that the refashioned
                        question has to remain within the four corners of s 60 of the
                        SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Bearing the above principles in mind, we were of the view that the
                    question posed by the Applicant need not be rephrased. The question as worded by
                    the Judge simply queried whether the assumption in s 71A of the RTA ought
                    to apply to an offence under s 67 of the RTA where an offence under
                    s 68 of the RTA has been made out. It did not address situations where an
                    offence under s 68 of the RTA had not been made out but where there was a
                    time lag between the driving and the breath test. The narrowness of the
                    Judge’s question made it, in our view, less helpful than the current
                    question posed by the Applicant which was also broad enough to cover the
                    Judge’s question. The question as phrased by the Judge would not furnish
                    guidance in situations such as where a driver who was drunk stopped his car and
                    walked away from the vehicle but was subsequently arrested on suspicion of
                    either having been in charge of a car when under the influence of drink or for
                    driving while under the influence of drink (<em>ie</em>,
                    drink driving). We were also of the view that the question posed by the
                    Applicant ought not to be rephrased as a question of whether, given facts
                    similar to the present case, s 67 or s 68 was the more appropriate
                    charge. The power to decide whether to prosecute under a particular charge lies
                    squarely with the Public Prosecutor. In any event, the question suggested by the
                    Respondent did nothing to clarify the true import of the public interest
                    question posed by the Applicant, <em>ie</em>, the
                    circumstances under which the assumption in s 71A of the RTA would apply to
                    a driver accused of an offence under s 67 of the RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Having heard the submissions of both parties,
                    we held that the question posed by the applicant ought to be answered in the
                    affirmative. We now give the detailed grounds for our decision.</p>

                provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The UK Criminal Justice Act 1925, UK Road Traffic Act 1930
                and Straits Settlement Road Traffic Ordinance 1941: one provision combining drink
                driving and being in control while under influence of drink</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The modern day RTA has its genesis in the Road
                    Traffic Ordinance of 1941 (No 17 of 1941) (“RTO 1941”),
                    which was modelled on the contemporary UK provisions of that period. In both the
                    local and UK provisions, the offence of driving while under the influence of
                    drink was indistinguishable from the offence of being in charge of a motor
                    vehicle while under the influence of drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Indeed, an early provision did not even refer
                    expressly to the specific action of driving (or attempting to drive) a motor
                    vehicle. This is a significant point which we will return to below (at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>) inasmuch as it accords with both logic and
                    commonsense that when one is driving a motor vehicle, one is <em>necessarily</em> also in charge of it. However, as we shall also
                    elaborate upon below, it does <em>not necessarily</em>
                    follow that if one is in charge of a motor vehicle, one must simultaneously be
                    driving it. This (early) provision was, in fact, s 40 of the UK Criminal
                    Justice Act 1925 (Cap 86) (“UKCJA 1925”), which read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        respect of each offence to imprisonment for a period not exceeding four
                        months or to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or to both such imprisonment

                    just one isolated provision on drink driving. The first substantive UK statute
                    dealing with road traffic offences proper appears to be the UK Road Traffic Act
                    1930 (Cap 43) (“UKRTA 1930”), to which our attention now

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">During the second reading of the UK Road Traffic Bill on
                    16 December 1929, Lord Raglan proposed an amendment in favour of
                    excluding the words “or when in charge of” from
                    subsection (1) of the above provision. He pointed out that (see <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) - House of Lords</em>
                    (16 December 1929) vol 75 at col 1337):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… thousands of people are left in charge every day who have never
                        driven or had any intention of driving a car. These persons, who are merely
                        sitting in a car to prevent any one stealing it, would, if they are slightly
                        under the influence of drink, be liable under this clause as it stands to
                        four months imprisonment and a fine of £50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Eventually, the amendment was withdrawn. However, the parliamentary
                    speeches in relation to this proposed amendment are instructive. Earl Russell
                    opined thus (see <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) - House of
                        Lords</em> (16 December 1929) vol 75 at
                    cols 1337–1338):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Without these words a great many people who cannot be properly convicted
                        would escape conviction because you would not be able to convict unless
                        there was actual evidence that the person had been driving or had attempted
                        to drive. That is, unless someone has seen him doing so, whereas the
                        policeman who found him had no doubt he was driving or intended to drive. I
                        think I dealt with the point before. If a car was found smashed against a
                        lamppost and a man was found asleep in the ruins of it you might then say he
                        could properly be convicted for the words would cover his case. The Home
                        Secretary attaches great importance to these words. His advice from the
                        police of the country is that a great many who ought to be convicted would
                        escape unless they were left in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response to a hypothetical situation by Earl Howe regarding a
                    young lady who found herself unable to drive and was discovered asleep in the
                    vehicle without having attempted to drive, Earl Russell replied (see
                        <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) - House of
                        Lords</em> (16 December 1929) vol 75 at
                    col 1338):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think it is perfectly clear that in such circumstances the court ought
                        not to convict. First of all, if I were the chief constable I should not
                        authorise a prosecution in a case of that sort, but if he has authorised it
                        I do not know that the court is bound to convict, if she has done no act to
                        show that she was in charge of the motor car. She might have been a
                        stranger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The above extracts reveal that, when the
                    provision was first drafted in the UKRTA 1930, it was envisaged that a
                    person who had been drink driving could be convicted even if he had ceased
                    driving at the time of arrest. However, a person who had fallen asleep in the
                    vehicle as a result of the influence of drink<em>, but who had no
                        intention to operate the vehicle</em>, was <em>not</em> intended to be caught by that provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 15 of the UKRTA 1930 was
                    imported into Singapore largely unchanged in the form of s 27 of the
                    RTO 1941, which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Driving while under influence of drink or
                            drugs</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        driving or attempting to drive <em>or sitting in the driving
                            seat of a motor vehicle</em> on a road or other public place is
                        under the influence of drink or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable
                        of having proper control of such vehicle shall be liable on conviction to a
                        fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
                        exceeding four months and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction
                        either to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to such imprisonment
                        as aforesaid or to both such fine and imprisonment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that no person found sitting in the driving seat of a motor

                        of the conviction for holding or obtaining a driving licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the purpose of the present analysis, the main difference between
                    the two provisions is that in s 27 of the RTO 1941 the words
                    “or when in charge of” were replaced with “sitting in the
                    driving seat of a motor vehicle”. The Report of the Select Committee
                    appointed by the Straits Settlements Legislative Council to review the draft
                    Road Traffic Bill (on 14 October 1940) as well as the Minutes of the
                    meeting of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council (on 14 February
                    1941) relating to the Road Traffic Bill are silent on why these changes were
                    made. Nevertheless, it is plausible, in our view, that the insertion of the
                    words “sitting in the driving seat of the motor car” and (in
                    particular) the proviso to s 27(1) were intended to avoid the conviction of
                    an accused in situations such as that posed in the hypothetical situation
                    suggested by Earl Howe, where persons who had taken alcohol <em>but had no intention to drive</em> were found in a motor
                    vehicle (see above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). Section 27
                    of the RTO 1941 was subsequently renumbered as s 26 of the Road
                    Traffic Ordinance 1955 (“RTO 1955”), and the amount of the
                    fine that could be imposed was raised, but otherwise the provision remained the
                    same until the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961 (“RTO 1961”) came
                    into force.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The UK Road Traffic Act 1956, the UK Road Traffic Act 1960
                and the Singapore Road Traffic Ordinance 1961: separate provisions for driving under
                influence of drink or drugs and being in charge of motor vehicle when under the
                influence of drink or drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The UK background: the UK Road Traffic Act 1956 and the UK
                Road Traffic Act 1960</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The offence of driving under the influence of
                    drink and being in charge of a motor vehicle when under the influence of drink
                    remained one and the same in the UK until the UK Road Traffic Act 1956
                    (“UKRTA 1956”) was enacted. The <em>decoupling</em> of the two offences appears to have come about as a
                    result of a growing sentiment that was aired in the UK Parliament to the effect
                    that to treat both offences as being equally culpable offences was unreasonable.
                    In the words of Lord Brabazon of Tara (see <em>Parliamentary
                        Debates (Hansard) - House of Lords</em> (21 December 1954)
                    vol 190 at col 608):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…these words “or when in charge of” are causing great
                        injustices up and down the country. The sort of thing which has occurred is
                        this. A man goes out to a party, perfectly sober. At the party he may drink
                        too much, and he comes to the conclusion that he is not fit to drive back.
                        He sits in the back of his car and gives the ignition key to somebody else.
                        He is prosecuted for being in charge of that motor-car. That is a travesty
                        of justice; and, what is more, it is an encouragement to the man to drive
                        when he has made the sound resolution in his mind that he is not capable of
                        driving… At some stage I should like to see the words “or when
                        in charge of” deleted from the Act, because it is a definite
                        encouragement to people to drive when they should not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And, as observed by Earl Jowitt (see <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) – House of Lords</em>
                    (21 December 1954) vol 190 at col 633):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I heard of a case of a man who left his car on the road outside his house
                        and did not turn on his lights. He proceeded to dine at his own house, not
                        wisely but too well, and was rather drunk after dinner. He was wearing his
                        pyjamas when the police came along and wanted to know who was the owner of
                        the car. They wanted to have the lights turned on. Down went the gentleman
                        in his pyjamas to turn the lights on, the police saw he was drunk and they
                        prosecuted him for being drunk in charge of a car. I cannot think that that
                        kind of thing is desirable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Finally, in the words of Earl Howe (see <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) - House of Lords</em> (14 March
                    1955) vol 191 at col 1006):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, since we had our last debate upon this subject, a most curious
                        case has arisen. It was reported in various newspapers on March 9 that
                        an undergraduate of Oxford went to a party keeping the ignition key of his
                        car, and leaving his car outside a public place. He was charged with being
                        drunk in charge of a car. It was urged on his behalf that he was on private
                        property, and that he was not trying to drive the car at all. Furthermore,
                        the moment the police arrived and found him he handed over the ignition key
                        of the car. The report went on to say that he was none the less fined
                        £20, ordered to pay £20 costs and disqualified from driving for
                        twelve months. I join with everybody who has spoken on this subject: I have
                        no use whatever for people who try to drive a motor car while under the
                        influence of drink or drugs, and I yield to no one in my detestation of that
                        offence. Nevertheless, I do feel that, under the existing law, it is
                        possible for an injustice to occur, as has been so well put by the noble
                        Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     During the Second Reading of the UK Road
                    Traffic Bill on 12 June 1956, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (The
                    Earl of Selkirk) had this to say about the decoupling of the two offences (see
                        <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) - House of
                        Lords</em> (12 June 1956) vol 197 at col 846):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 9, a new clause, seeks to resolve a problem with which we are
                        very much concerned – to distinguish between “driving under the
                        influence” and “drunk in charge”. This point was
                        brought very forcefully to our attention by the noble Lord,
                        Lord Brabazon of Tara, and the discussions which we then had have laid
                        the foundation for the proposals now in this clause. <em>Broadly, the offence of being drunk in charge is now treated as a
                            separate offence to which there is a statutory defence that the driver
                            had not, in fact, driven the car and that there was no likelihood of his
                            doing so</em>. I very much hope that this solution will commend
                        itself to the House. It has been very carefully examined. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Having regard to the background set out above,
                    it appears clear that the two offences were <em>decoupled</em> in order to prevent the injustice that would result
                    from the conflating of drink driving with (a) the situation where a person
                    was drunk and in control of a motor vehicle but had not driven it; and
                    (b) the situation where a person was drunk but had not driven and could not
                    have been said to have been in control of a motor vehicle in any other than an
                    extremely technical sense. More importantly (for the purposes of the present
                    proceedings), it is clear that this decoupling was not intended to detract
                    – in any way – from the need to proscribe (in no uncertain terms)
                    the first offence, <em>viz</em>, drink driving, which, by
                    its very nature (as demonstrated, <em>inter alia</em>, by
                    s 40 of the UKCJA 1925 (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>)), <em>necessarily entails</em> the
                    accused being <em>in charge</em> of the motor vehicle
                        <em>in the first place</em>. Looked at in this light,
                    the second offence is <em>much narrower</em> inasmuch as it
                    refers to a situation where the accused, whilst also being in charge of the
                    motor vehicle and intending to drive it, <em>has not, at the time
                        of being apprehended, yet driven it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     To summarise, there was a <em>decoupling</em> of offences with the result (in substance) that
                    whilst the accused is in charge of the motor vehicle in the case of <em>both</em> offences, the <em>first</em>
                    offence relates to <em>actual</em> drink driving (which is
                    obviously more serious as the danger to the safety of others would be a very
                    real and immediate one) whereas the <em>second</em> offence
                    relates to a situation where the accused is apprehended before he or she has
                    actually driven the motor vehicle. However, <em>legislative
                        safeguards</em> were required with respect to the <em>second</em> offence in order to <em>exclude</em>
                    from prosecution persons who, whilst unfit to drive the motor vehicle concerned,
                    had in fact <em>not</em> driven it and could be shown to
                    have <em>no intention of driving</em> it, lest injustice
                    occur. <em>It was this injustice that was the subject of much
                        criticism in the UK Parliament</em> (as set out above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>) and which the UKRTA 1956 in general and s 9
                    thereof in particular were supposed to meet. It is also important to note, at
                    this juncture, that <em>the Public Prosecutor would have the
                        discretion as to which one of these two offences it wished to charge the
                        accused with</em>. Indeed, since the first offence, of actual drink
                    driving, necessarily entails the accused being in charge of the motor vehicle in
                    the first place, it is clear that the accused could potentially be charged with
                        <em>either</em> offence (which was precisely the fact
                    situation that arose in the present proceedings). How that discretion is to be
                    exercised is a matter for the Prosecution, having regard to all the
                    circumstances of the case (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Returning to the UKRTA 1956, the new
                    s 9 read, in fact, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        pounds or to such imprisonment as aforesaid or to both such fine and

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that a person shall be deemed for the purposes of

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) that at the material time the circumstances were such that
                            there was no likelihood of his driving the vehicle so long as he
                            remained unfit to drive; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) that between his becoming unfit to drive and the material
                            time he had not driven the vehicle on a road or other public
                            place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this subsection the expression “unfit to drive” means
                        under the influence of drink or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable
                        of having proper control of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) On a second or subsequent conviction of an offence under this
                        section the offender shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit
                        to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order
                        a longer period of disqualification, be disqualified for a period of twelve
                        months from the date of the conviction for holding or obtaining a licence;
                        and a person disqualified by virtue of a conviction under this section or of
                        an order made thereunder for holding or obtaining a licence shall, for the
                        purposes of Part I of the Act of 1930, be deemed to be disqualified by
                        virtue of a conviction under the provisions of that Part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) In subsection (1) of section fifteen of the Act of 1930 the
                        words “or when in charge of” shall cease to have
                        effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It can be seen that s 9 of the
                    UKRTA 1956 attempts to capture the situation where the accused is in charge
                    of a motor vehicle insofar as he or she has not driven it but is apprehended at
                    a point in time when he or she can be shown to have the intention of driving it.
                    As a corollary, it also attempts, therefore, to <em>exclude</em> from its ambit persons who can be demonstrated not to
                    have driven the motor vehicle <em>and to have no intention of
                        driving it</em>. Whereas there is <em>potential</em> danger to other persons in the former situation, there
                    is <em>no</em> danger to other persons at all in the latter
                    situation, and this would justify the exclusion of such a situation from the
                    ambit of s 9 altogether. It should be reiterated that s 9 did
                        <em>not</em> appear to have been intended to impact (in
                    any way) the <em>quite separate</em> offence of <em>actual drink driving</em> under s 15 of the
                    UKRTA 1930 (reproduced above at [18]), which was an offence that presented
                        <em>even greater potential</em> danger to other persons
                    and hence entailed <em>more severe penalties</em>. Indeed,
                        s 9(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) and (ii) capture situations
                    such as those in the English decisions of <em>Jowett-Shooter v
                        Franklin</em> [1949] 2 All ER 730 and <em>Jones v English</em> [1951] 2 All ER 853, which were
                    decided pursuant to s 15 of the UKRTA 1930 and which, in order to do
                    justice to the accused concerned, entailed the court concerned exercising its
                    discretion under that particular provision to order that the accused <em>not</em> be disqualified from holding a driving
                    licence.</p>

                        a longer period of disqualification, be disqualified for a period of twelve
                        months from the date of the conviction for holding or obtaining a driving

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The amendments were introduced to bring the
                    provisions of the RTO 1961 “into line with Federation and United
                    Kingdom legislation” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, 14 June 1961, vol 14 at col 1640
                        (<em>per</em> the Minister for Labour and Law,
                    Mr K M Byrne)). Section 27(2) of the RTO 1961 was
                    repealed in 1968 and ss 27 and 38 of the same Act were renumbered as ss 28
                    and 29, respectively, but otherwise these provisions remained largely the same
                    in the Revised Edition of the Road Traffic Act of 1970
                    (“RTA 1970”). These sections were again renumbered, this time
                    as ss 29 and 30, in the 1973 Reprint of the Road Traffic Act
                    (“RTA 1973”). The fact that the local provisions <em>replicated</em>, in both letter <em>and</em> purpose, the corresponding provisions in the UK is a point
                    of the first importance. Put simply, the distinction between the offences of
                    drink driving and being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of
                    drink in the UK and the reasons for such a distinction apply with equal force
                    locally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   The Road Traffic Act 1976: introduction of blood and urine
                testing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Prior to 1976, there was no provision in our
                    local Road Traffic Act for blood, urine or breath testing. The statute also did
                    not require persons to submit to medical examinations. Provisions for blood and
                    urine testing were first introduced in the 1976 amendments to the RTA 1973.
                    It became obligatory for a person arrested under s 29 (for drink driving)
                    or s 30 (for being in control of a motor vehicle when under the influence
                    of drink or drugs) of the RTA 1973 to provide a specimen of his blood or
                    urine for a laboratory test if required to do so by the police. The relevant
                    provisions read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Blood and urine test</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>30A. –</b> (1) A person who has been
                        arrested under section 29 or 30 of this Act may be required to provide
                        at a hospital a specimen of his blood or urine, or both, for a laboratory
                        test if the police has reasonable cause to suspect such person of having
                        alcohol or a drug in his body; but a person shall not be required to provide
                        a specimen of his blood for a laboratory test under this subsection if a
                        medical practitioner in immediate charge of his case is not first notified
                        of the proposal to make the requirement or objects to the provision of such
                        specimen on the ground that its provision would be prejudicial to the proper
                        care or treatment of the patient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A person who without reasonable excuse fails to provide a specimen for
                        a laboratory test in pursuance of a requirement imposed under subsection (1)
                        of this section shall be guilty of an offence and if it is shown that at the
                        time of any accident or of his arrest –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) he was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road
                        or other public place, he shall be liable to be punished as if the offence
                        charged were an offence under section 29 of this Act; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) he was in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or other public
                        place, he shall be liable to be punished as if the offence charged were an
                        offence under section 30 of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) For the purposes of any proceedings for an offence under
                        section 29 or 30 of this Act or subsection (2) of this section, a
                        certificate purporting to be signed by a medical practitioner that he took a
                        specimen of blood or urine from a person with his consent shall be evidence
                        of the matters so certified and of the qualifications of the medical
                        practitioner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that such certificate shall not be accepted as evidence for the
                        prosecution unless a copy thereof had been served on the accused not less
                        than seven days before the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) A police officer shall, on requiring any person under this
                        section to provide a specimen for a laboratory test, warn him that failure
                        to provide a specimen of blood or urine may make him liable to imprisonment,
                        a fine and disqualification, and if the police officer fails to do so, the
                        court before which that person is charged with an offence under
                        subsection (2) of this section may dismiss the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Presumption of incapability of having proper control of
                            motor vehicle</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>30B. –</b> Any person who has been
                        arrested under section 29 or 30 of this Act shall be presumed to be
                        incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle if the specimen of
                        blood provided by him under section 30A of this Act is certified by a
                        medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration in excess of
                        110 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 30B of the RTA 1973 (reproduced above) created a
                    presumption that if a person’s blood was tested and found to have an
                    alcohol blood concentration in excess of 110 mg of alcohol in 100 ml
                    of blood, that person was incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle.
                    This presumption, however, could be rebutted by evidence that the accused was
                    capable of having proper control of a motor vehicle. The introduction of this
                    provision was welcomed by Members of Parliament as certifying whether or not a
                    person was intoxicated under the previous law was difficult and depended on the
                    individual judgment of the medical practitioner concerned (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (25 March 1976) vol 35 at col 965 (<em>per</em> the Member of Parliament for Kim Seng, Dr Ong Leong
                    Boon)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   The Road Traffic Act 1985: introduction of breathalyser
                screening</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the 1985 Reprint of the Road Traffic Act,
                    ss 29, 30, 30A and 30B were renumbered as ss 68, 69, 70 and 71
                    respectively. Parliament made two further amendments to these provisions in the
                    same year as a result of the increase in serious and fatal accidents involving
                    drivers and motorcycle riders who were under the influence of alcohol (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (30 August 1985) vol 46 at col 326
                        (<em>per</em> the Minister for Home Affairs and Second
                    Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar)). First, the blood alcohol
                    concentration limit in s 71 was lowered from 110 mg of alcohol in
                    100 ml of blood to 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. This was
                    done because, as the Minister for Home Affairs, Professor Jayakumar
                    explained, “[a]mending the legal blood alcohol content level from the
                    existing 110 mg/100 ml to 80 mg/100 ml will serve to deter
                    motorists from driving if they consume alcohol excessively” (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (30 August 1985) vol 46 at col 327).
                    Secondly, the use of breathalysers was introduced as a screening (as opposed to
                    an evidentiary) measure by way of s 71A. Prior to the introduction of
                    breathalysers, where a driver was suspected to be under the influence of
                    alcohol, he had to be brought to a hospital for blood and urine tests.
                    Professor Jayakumar observed that this was “a troublesome as well as
                    an unpopular procedure – both for the individual and the Police”
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (30 August 1985) vol 46 at col 326). With
                    the introduction of breathalysers, the driver would be brought to the hospital
                    for confirmatory blood and urine tests only where the reading of the
                    breathalyser exceeded the legal prescribed limit. In the 1985 Revised Edition of
                    the Road Traffic Act (“RTA 1985”), ss 68, 69, 70, 71 and
                    71A were renumbered as ss 67 (driving while under the influence of drink or
                    drugs), 68 (being in charge of a motor vehicle when under the influence of drink
                    or drugs), 69 (blood and urine test), 70 (presumption of incapability of having
                    proper control of motor vehicle), and 71 (breath tests), respectively.
                    Section 71 read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                    increase the sentence that could be imposed for the respective offences. In
                    1993, s 67A was inserted to empower the courts to impose a range of
                    punishment on persons who had been convicted multiple times for specific
                    offences, of which drink driving was one. In Parliament, the Minister for Home
                    Affairs, Professor Jayakumar, observed as follows (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (18 January 1993) vol 60 at col 429):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Repeat offenders of drunken driving must be dealt with severely...

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Following the 1996 amendments, s 71A
                    provided for the use of the results of a BEA test as evidence for offences under
                    s 67 and s 68. Unlike s 70 of the RTA 1994, the new
                    s 71A provided that the BEA reading was not just a rebuttable presumption
                    but an assumption that would apply unless the exceptions in s 71A(2) were
                    made out. New offences (for driving or being in charge of a vehicle while having
                    so much alcohol in the body that the proportion of it in the breath or blood
                    exceeded the prescribed limit) were created in the form of
                        s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) and s 68(1)(<em>b</em>). The rationale for these extensive changes can be
                    found in the following extract from the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs,
                    Mr Wong Kan Seng (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (27 February 1996) vol 65 at
                    cols 722–724):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Streamline procedures for drink
                        driving</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presently, under section 70 of the Act, a person is presumed
                        incapable of having proper control of his vehicle if he has alcohol content
                        in his blood in excess of 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. To
                        ascertain this, police has to escort the motorist to the hospital for a
                        blood test and the result will only be known after two weeks. The current
                        procedure is therefore inefficient and manpower intensive. We thus propose
                        using a device called Breath Evidential Analyser (BEA) to assess the alcohol
                        level. This device measures the alcohol level in a motorist's breath and
                        produces a printout of the result immediately. The printout can also be
                        tendered in court as evidence. As the test can be performed by police
                        officers at any police station, there is therefore no need to bring the
                        motorist to the hospital for a blood test. The use of the Breath Evidential
                        Analyser is expected to save police about 1,500 man hours per year. The
                        breathalyser technique has been successfully used in UK, Sweden, Norway and
                        the United States.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact sections 69,
                        70, 71, 71A, 71B, 71C to deal with drink driving. Essentially, the new
                        sections are a re-enactment of existing sections but with suitable
                        modifications to give effect to the new regime of Breathalyser test and to
                        provide for its results to be admissible in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Other Amendments</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from the measures I mentioned above, we are also introducing other
                        amendments. These are meant to tighten the various provisions of the Road
                        Traffic Act. These are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    
              <em>Presumption of incapability for
                        drink-drivers</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, under existing section 70 of the Act, a person is presumed
                        to be incapable of having proper control of his vehicle if the amount of
                        alcohol found in his blood is above the prescribed legal limit. This has
                        given rise to a situation where the defence tries to rebut this presumption
                        by trying to prove in each case that the defendant did not lose control of
                        the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To prevent unnecessary debate, clause 9 of the Bill seeks to re-enact
                            section 67(1)(<em>b</em>) to make the presence
                        of alcohol exceeding the legal limit in a driver’s blood or breath an
                        offence in itself without linking it to the control of vehicle. The new
                            section 67(1)(<em>b</em>) makes it clear that
                        an offence is committed once the driver’s alcohol content exceeds the
                        prescribed limit. This provision is similar to the provisions in Malaysian
                        and UK legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    
              <em>Driving under the influence of intoxicating
                            substance</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presently, it is not an offence for a person to drive or to be in charge
                        of a vehicle whilst under the influence of an intoxicating substance. This
                        is an anomalous situation. To plug this loophole, the re-enactment of
                            section 67(1)(<em>a</em>) has been expanded to
                        make driving whilst under the influence of any intoxicating substance
                        specified in the Intoxicating Substances Act, such as Toulene which is
                        commonly known as glue, an offence. The same penalty for drunken driving
                        will apply to this new offence. The presence of or an intoxicating substance
                        in the body will be determined by a blood test in the same manner as it is
                        currently done for alcohol or drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>c</em>)    
              <em>Testing of alcohol content by medical
                            practitioners</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presently, the Road Traffic Act requires consent of the motorist to be
                        obtained before his blood can be taken to determine the alcohol content.
                        However, in some circumstances, the consent cannot be given or sought, such
                        as when the motorist is unconscious. In such cases, the alcohol content in
                        the blood of the motorist cannot be ascertained and the motorist cannot be
                        charged for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the new section 71B(1), the police will be given the power to
                        direct the doctor to send a sample of the blood of the motorist taken by him
                        while treating the injured motorist for a laboratory test to determine the
                        proportion of alcohol or drug or intoxicating substances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is clear, from the extract reproduced in
                    the preceding paragraph, that the BEA assumption was introduced as an
                    evidentiary measure to enable the Prosecution to secure the conviction of
                    persons committing offences under ss 67 and 68 of the RTA. No further
                    material amendments to ss 67–71C were made in the 1997 Revised
                    Edition of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA 1997”) but in the
                    (latest) 2004 Revised Edition of the RTA, s 71C was renumbered as
                    s 72.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purpose of RTA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The long title of the RTA reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An Act for the regulation of road traffic and the use of vehicles and the
                        user of roads and the operation of bus interchanges and for other purposes
                        connected therewith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The long titles of earlier versions of the Road Traffic Act, however,
                    shed more light on the legislative intention of the statute itself. The long
                    title of the RTO 1941, for example, stated that its purpose was, <em>inter alia</em>, “to make provision for the protection
                    of third parties against risks arising out of the use of motor
                    vehicles”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The protection of road users from the risks of
                    harm, particularly in relation to drink driving, is a theme that has been
                    reiterated in Parliament on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For example, the Minister for Home Affairs,
                    Professor Jayakumar, expressed the following view (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (28 March
                    1990) vol 55 at cols 958 and 960):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… we must be concerned over a group of what I term “high
                        risk” drivers who account for a significant proportion of some 25% of
                        accidents and who should be controlled if we want to make our roads safer
                        for all pedestrians, riders and motorists… I make no apologies for
                        proposing heavier penalties for drunk drivers. They have no business driving
                        on the roads, because drunk drivers when involved in accidents cause
                        needless injuries and deaths either to themselves or other road
                        users…. We must prevent such tragic accidents, which are totally
                        unnecessary. In fact, we must get every driver in Singapore to note that
                        when he is issued a licence, it is in fact a very special privilege and it
                        is granted on condition that he drives in a responsible manner bearing in
                        mind the interest of others. And certainly no driver in Singapore who drinks
                        can claim or should be able to claim that he was unaware of the serious
                        consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Professor Jayakumar reiterated his views
                    at a subsequent session of Parliament thus (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (18 January 1993)
                    vol 60 at col 429):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are concerned with offences like driving whilst under disqualification
                        or suspension, reckless or dangerous driving, causing death by reckless or
                        dangerous driving and drunken driving. These offences rank high amongst the
                        most serious offences…. Despite tougher measures taken in 1990, the
                        problem of drunken driving still persists and continues to rear its ugly
                        head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the question reserved for our determination</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Historical context and legislative purpose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We have set out a comprehensive account of
                    both the historical context of the RTA as well as its legislative purpose as an
                    understanding of both is, in our view, of the first importance in answering the
                    question reserved for our determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Looking at the <em>historical
                        context</em>, it is clear that what are now ss 67 and 68 of the
                    RTA are <em>both</em> premised on the accused having been
                    in charge of the motor vehicle concerned. Indeed, this is why both provisions
                    were part of a broad provision (in s 40 of the UKCJA 1925 (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>)), which referred only to an
                    offence of being drunk whilst in charge of a motor car (but which was clearly
                    targeted at both actual drink driving as well as being in charge of a motor car,
                    whilst drunk, with the intention of driving it). These two specific aspects
                    were, in fact, incorporated in s 15 of the UKRTA 1930 (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). <em>However</em>, because the second offence (<em>viz</em>, being in charge of a motor car, whilst drunk, with the
                    intention of driving it) could – in certain exceptional fact situations
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>) – catch conduct which Parliament never
                    intended to capture (hence, resulting in injustice), s 9 of the
                    UKRTA 1956 (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>)
                    was enacted. As we have seen, this last-mentioned provision (later re-enacted as
                    s 6 of the UKRTA 1960 (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>)) formed the basis for the substantive offences in
                    ss 27 and 28 of the (Singapore) RTO 1961 (reproduced above at
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>), which (in turn) constituted the
                    progenitors of both ss 67 and 68 of the RTA, respectively. In the
                    circumstances, therefore, having a common root or source, it is clear, in our
                    view, that s 71A of the RTA ought, in principle, to apply to <em>both</em> ss 67 and 68, regardless of whether or not the
                    accused was driving a vehicle at the time of the arrest. This conclusion is
                    buttressed by the objectives of the provisions relating to drink driving in the
                    RTA itself – a point to which our attention must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The issue that arises in the present
                    proceedings in relation to the purpose of the RTA is neatly encapsulated in the
                    following question: could Parliament have intended that the assumption under
                    s 71A of the RTA would not apply to an accused charged under
                        s 67(1)(<em>b</em>) of the RTA where the accused
                    was not driving a vehicle at the time of the arrest? Having considered the fact
                    that ss 67 and 68 of the RTA had been enacted (originally as ss 27 and
                    28 of the RTO 1961) <em>prior to</em> s 71A of
                    the RTA which was itself enacted as an evidentiary tool to assist in securing
                    convictions for these two offences in the appropriate fact circumstances, and
                    having taken into account the uniform (and strict) approach towards drink
                    driving as demonstrated in the relevant proceedings in Parliament (see generally
                    above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>–<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>), we are of the view that this could <em>not</em> have been the intention of Parliament. Further, s 67 of
                    the RTA plainly states that any person who, when driving or attempting to drive
                    a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, had so much alcohol in his body
                    that the proportion of it in his breath exceeded the prescribed limit shall be
                    guilty of an offence. There is nothing in that particular provision to suggest
                    that the offence abates just because the drink driver stops after a particular
                    point of time. Certainly, nothing in the Parliamentary Debates (see generally
                    above at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>) as well as in the relevant provisions suggest that those
                    who drive with excess alcohol could necessarily escape punishment just because
                    there was a lapse of time between the commission of the offence and the
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is now appropriate to turn to two other
                    issues which figured prominently in the arguments of counsel for the Respondent.
                    The first relates to the reasons given by the Judge in the court below for
                    arriving at the decision he did. The second relates to case authorities which
                    counsel for the Respondent sought to rely upon in support of his client’s
                    case. Let us consider each issue <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons in the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As just mentioned, counsel for the Respondent
                    relied on the reasons that the Judge in the court below gave for quashing the
                    conviction imposed by the District Judge. These have already been referred to
                    above (at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). To recapitulate, they were as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     First, the Judge was of the view that on a
                    charge under s 68(1) of the RTA, it was open to the accused to prove (by
                    way of a defence) that the circumstances in s 68(2), <em>viz</em>, that at the time he or she was driving the motor vehicle,
                    his or her alcohol level was not over the limit, even though by operation of
                    s 71A of the RTA, his or her alcohol level at the time he or she was
                    apprehended would be assumed to be not less than the level found in the specimen
                    given by him or her. In other words, if s 71A of the RTA were applicable to
                    a charge under s 67(1) of the RTA in the circumstances of the present case,
                    the accused (here, the Respondent) would be deprived of a defence that would
                    have been available to him under s 68(2) of the RTA if he had been charged
                    under s 68(1) instead (see the GD at [12]). However, where a single act
                    could constitute the basis for more than one offence, the Prosecution has the
                    discretion to choose which section to proceed under. If so, this particular
                    reason is, with respect, premature as the availability of a defence to the
                    accused becomes a relevant issue only <em>after</em> the
                    charge is preferred. Put simply, if a charge is preferred against the accused
                    under s 67(1) of the RTA, then no issue with regard to a defence under
                    s 68(1) can be raised in any event. A corollary of this is that the accused
                    is <em>still entitled</em> to (and is <em>not</em>, therefore, <em>deprived</em> of) his
                    or her defence under s <em>68(2)</em> of the RTA if
                        <em>he or she is charged under s 68(1)</em> of the
                    RTA. This brings us back to the question of prosecutorial discretion which is,
                    of course, a <em>quite separate and distinct</em> issue
                    altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Secondly, the Judge was of the view that if
                    s 71A of the RTA were applicable where a person, apprehended whilst he was
                    in charge of a vehicle (as opposed to whilst he was driving it), was charged
                    with an offence under s 67(1) of the RTA, it would mean that he was better
                    off refusing to provide a breath or blood specimen. This was because without the
                    result from the specimen, he could only be convicted under s 68(1) of the
                    RTA; if he gave a specimen and admitted that he had driven the motor vehicle
                    earlier, he could be convicted under the more severe offence under s 67(1)
                    of the RTA (see the GD at [17]). With respect, however, this particular reason
                    ignores the fact that, <em>in addition to</em> a conviction
                    under s 70 of the RTA, the failure to provide a specimen could also attract
                    (pursuant to s 69(4) of the RTA) a fine ranging between $1,000 to $5,000 or
                    a jail term of up to 6 months for a first time offender. In the case of a
                    repeat offender, the fine that could be imposed is increased to between $3,000
                    and $10,000 and the jail term could be one of up to 12 months. Arguably, as
                    a person refusing to provide a specimen could be sentenced to a longer period in
                    jail, he would not necessarily be better off refusing to provide a breath or
                    blood specimen even if by doing so he would be charged under s 68(1)
                    instead of s 67 and would not be disqualified from driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Therefore, we were not convinced that either
                    of the reasons relied upon by the Judge in the court below supported a negative
                    answer to the question referred to us in the present proceedings. On the
                    contrary (and as we have seen), the key factors centring on the historical
                    context as well as the legislative purpose embodied in the RTA support an
                    affirmative answer to the said question instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It was also argued that, if the assumption in
                    s 71A of the RTA applied even when a driver was arrested after having
                    stopped the motor vehicle, there would be no incentive for him or her to cease
                    drink driving once he or she had commenced. It was argued, conversely, that if
                    the assumption in s 71A did not apply, the driver would have an incentive
                    to stop because then he or she could only be charged with the lesser offence
                    under s 68 of the RTA which did not provide for disqualification of driving
                    licenses. However, an offence does not cease to be an offence just because the
                    accused, having already committed the act constituting the offence, decides to
                    refrain from <em>continuing</em> with the conduct
                    concerned. Further, it is not, strictly speaking, accurate to state that a
                    driver has no incentive to stop once he or she had commenced drink driving. If
                    the driver voluntarily arrests the risk he or she was hitherto posing to the
                    public in ceasing to drive, his or her initiative could well be taken into
                    account in mitigation. One would imagine that if the accused had only driven,
                    say, a few metres and stopped (so that there was, albeit only technically
                    speaking, an offence committed under s 67 of the RTA), the Prosecution
                    might even decide, in the special circumstances of the case, to prefer a charge
                    against the driver <em>under s 68 of the RTA
                        instead</em>. In any event, the parliamentary background (referred to
                    above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>–<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>) demonstrates, in no uncertain terms, that the provisions
                    in the RTA (in relation, <em>inter alia</em>, to drink
                    driving) were clearly intended to have a deterrent effect. Hence, the imposition
                    of more severe penalties as well as a strict application of the applicable
                    provisions would serve to help achieve this deterrent effect, which consists of
                    deterring all drivers from drink driving in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Let us turn now to a brief consideration of a
                    few relevant case authorities cited in both the local as well as English
                    contexts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Case law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Counsel for the Respondent cited two local
                    decisions for the proposition that in situations such as the present (in which
                    the accused had ceased driving at the time of the arrest), a charge under
                    s 68 of the RTA (and <em>not</em> one under s 67)
                    ought to be preferred against the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Turning to the first decision, in <em>Ho Chun Kow v Public Prosecutor</em> [1990]
                    1 SLR(R) 575, one of the issues that arose was whether s 68 of
                    the RTA 1985 (<em>ie</em>, being in charge of a vehicle
                    when under the influence of drink or drugs) was “an offence in connection
                    with the driving of a motor vehicle” within the meaning of s 42
                    which provided that any court “before which a person is convicted of any
                    offences in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case
                    except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so
                    required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
                    driving licence for life or for such period as the court thinks fit”.
                    Chan Sek Keong J held that it was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The basis of Chan J’s holding was
                    essentially that not all factual circumstances in which a s 68 offence
                    could be made out would fall within the context of being “in connection
                    with” the driving of a motor vehicle even though there may be some
                    overlap between the two. He rightly observed (at [7]) that to hold otherwise
                    “would mean that the existence of the discretionary power of
                    disqualification [in s 42] is dependent not on the nature of the offence
                    but on the circumstances in which the offence is committed”. The case,
                    however, should not be taken to stand for the entirely different proposition
                    that where the accused has ceased driving and a s 68 offence can be made
                    out, a s 67 offence should not be preferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Chan J observed thus (at [8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A s 68(2) offence may be committed by a person in a situation where
                        just before he takes or is in charge of the vehicle, he (a) has driven
                        it whilst unfit to drive due to the influence of drink, (b) has driven
                        it but [<em>sic</em>] fit to drive even though under
                        the influence of drink or (c) has not driven it for a substantially
                        long period. <em>Of course, a person who is driving a motor
                            vehicle is, ipso facto, in charge of it, but in that case, if he is
                            unfit to drive whilst under the influence of drink, he should be charged
                            under s 67 and not s 68(1)</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage in fact buttresses our view that even where the accused
                    has ceased driving at the time of his or her arrest, he or she may nevertheless
                    be convicted for the offence of driving under the influence of drink or drugs
                    under s 67 of the RTA, notwithstanding the fact that the elements
                    constituting an offence under s 68 of the RTA may also be made out. Indeed,
                    this is not surprising for, as the learned judge pertinently points out, an
                    offence committed under s 67 must <em>necessarily</em>
                    entail the accused being in charge of the motor vehicle which, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, constitutes an offence under s 68
                    as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the second decision, <em>Chong Pit Khai v Public Prosecutor</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 423, the appellant pleaded guilty at trial to a charge of
                    drink driving under s 67 of the RTA. In sentencing the appellant, the
                    district judge took into consideration an antecedent, <em>viz</em>, a prior conviction under s 68 of the RTA for being in
                    charge of a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The appellant then appealed on the
                    ground that the district judge should not have given any consideration to his
                    earlier conviction under s 68 of the RTA for the purpose of sentencing him
                    for an offence under s 67 of the RTA. Chan Sek Keong CJ allowed the
                    appeal. He held that while a conviction for an offence under s 67 was
                    deemed, under the RTA, to be a previous conviction for an offence under
                    s 68, the RTA did not deem a conviction for an offence under s 68 as a
                    previous conviction for an offence under s 67. It was in <em>that particular context</em> that Chan CJ observed thus (at
                    [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The following points may be noted on a plain reading of the two sections.
                        First, the penalty prescribed for a s 67 offence is about <em>twice as serious</em> as a s 68 offence. In fact,
                        the prescribed penalty for a <em>first</em> s 67
                        offence is the same as the penalty for a <em>second</em> s 68 offence. The reason for the different
                        treatment can be explained on the basis that, in a scenario involving a
                        s 67 offence, the risk of injury to life and limb as well as damage to
                        property is current (as he is driving or about to drive) whereas for a
                        s 68 offence, the risk is past and gone. The offender of a s 68
                        offence is being punished for <em>having driven</em>
                        even though he might not have caused any injury to life and limb. The
                        s 68 offence is <b><em>to deter people from driving in
                            those two situations prescribed by the section</em></b>. [emphasis in
                        italics in original; emphasis in bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As already mentioned, the learned Chief
                    Justice was <em>illustrating</em> the difference in
                    culpability between an offence under s 67 of the RTA and an offence under
                    s 68 of the RTA for the purposes of explaining why a conviction under
                    s 68 of the RTA could not be treated as a prior conviction for the purposes
                    of sentencing for an offence under s 67 of the RTA. The above extract
                    should therefore not be misread to stand for the proposition that, once a drink
                    driver has stopped driving, he or she cannot be charged under s 67 any
                    longer but can only be charged under s 68 instead. Indeed, the <em>converse</em> is true. As already noted (above at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>), the Prosecution has the discretion to
                    choose between preferring a charge under s 67 or, instead, under s 68.
                    Further, one should also note the reference by the Chief Justice to the
                        <em>purpose</em> of s 68 as centring on the need
                    “to <em>deter</em> people <em>from
                        driving</em> in those two situations prescribed [in
                        s 68(1)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>)]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Finally, we turn briefly to two English
                    decisions which were cited and (more importantly) distinguished in the court
                    below, <em>viz</em>, <em>DPP v
                        Williams</em> [1989] Crim LR 382 (“<em>Williams</em>”) and <em>Millard v
                        DPP</em> [1990] Crim LR 601 (“<em>Millard</em>”), respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In <em>Williams</em>,
                    police officers found a car parked near to an address where they found the
                    respondent at around 4am. The respondent admitted that he had driven the car and
                    said his last drink had been some 5 hours earlier. The respondent failed
                    the breath test that was administered and was charged for drink driving. The
                    respondent submitted that by his imprecise admission of having driven that night
                    he could have been indicating that he had driven before he drank and as such the
                    Prosecution had not proven that at the time of driving the respondent was in
                    excess of the prescribed limit. This was rejected by the High Court who held
                    that the respondent bore the burden of displacing the assumption that his
                    breath/alcohol proportion had exceeded the statutory limit. Once he had admitted
                    driving and once the specimen he gave showed that he was over the prescribed
                    limit at the time of sampling, s 10(2) operated to transfer the burden to
                    the respondent. Since that burden had not been discharged, the assumption
                    applied and the respondent was guilty of drink driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Millard</em>, the
                    defendant ate sandwiches and drank a bottle of white wine for lunch between
                    1.15pm and 3.45pm before returning to his office where he remained until 5.30pm.
                    After leaving his office, he drove his car to a public house where he drank
                    nearly all of a large whisky. He then left, returned to his car and, at about
                    6.10pm, drove to another parking place before returning to the public house.
                    After he had drunk most of a pint of beer there, police officers spoke to him
                    and invited him outside. He was asked to take a roadside breath test, which he
                    did. The test was positive and so he was arrested and taken to a police station.
                    At the police station, between 7.15pm and 8.15pm, he provided specimens of
                    breath and blood which were found to contain alcohol above the prescribed limit.
                    He was charged. At the conclusion of his evidence, it was submitted on his
                    behalf that the court should hear expert evidence for the purpose of calculating
                    retrospectively the effect of the whisky drunk by the defendant prior to driving
                    and the beer drunk by him after driving. The court held that it was not open to
                    the defendant to introduce evidence of such retrospective calculation. The
                    defendant chose not to adduce evidence relating to the beer he had drunk after
                    driving (by doing so he might have brought himself within the exceptions of the
                    UK equivalent of s 71A of the RTA so that the assumption would not apply)
                    and he was convicted of the drink driving offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Judge was of the view that the respective
                    accused in <em>Williams</em> and <em>Millard</em> were not arrested <em>whilst
                        driving</em> a motor vehicle (see the GD at [23]). This stems, in
                    fact, from the Judge’s observation that s 68 of the RTA
                    “caters for the situation where a person is not apprehended while driving
                    or attempting to drive a vehicle, but where he can be said to be in charge of
                    the vehicle, such as in the present case where he had stopped it at the road
                    shoulder and had fallen asleep in it” (see the GD at [5]). Whilst this
                    last-mentioned observation is correct, this does not meet the argument that, if
                    the accused has <em>already driven</em> under the influence
                    of alcohol or drugs, then he or she would, <em>ex
                        hypothesi</em>, have <em>already committed</em>
                    an offence under s <em>67(1) of the RTA</em>.
                        <em>More importantly</em>, as we have already explained
                        above<em>, such an offence does not thereby cease to be an
                        offence just because the accused had literally stopped driving the motor
                        vehicle</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     More importantly, perhaps, the Judge was also
                    of the view that the respective courts in both <em>Williams</em> and <em>Millard</em> had not
                    considered the reasons referred to in the preceding section of this judgment.
                    However, we have already explained why those reasons ought not to be accepted.
                    Indeed, it would appear to us that both <em>Williams</em>
                    and <em>Millard</em> are, indeed, relevant and buttress the
                    decision which we have arrived at in the context of the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Miscellaneous issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Respondent had suggested that a police
                    officer had to determine whether a 67 offence or a s 68 offence was
                    going to be proceeded with before the police officer procured the breath
                    specimen. We do not agree. Pursuant to s 69(5) of the RTA, all the police
                    officer needs is reasonable cause to suspect that either offence has been
                    carried out. A person arrested pursuant to s 69(5) may be required to take
                    a BEA or a blood test pursuant to s 70. The results of that test form the
                    basis of the assumption in s 71A of the RTA. On a literal reading, there is
                    nothing in s 71A stating that if the police officer initially procured a
                    breath specimen for a BEA with reasonable cause to suspect drink driving, it
                    could not subsequently be assumed that the accused had the same alcohol levels
                    as the breath specimen if a charge of being in charge of a vehicle when under
                    the influence of drink was preferred instead. Of course, as a threshold
                    requirement, it must first be shown that the accused had driven at the time of
                    the alleged offence before the s 71A assumption can apply to a charge
                    pursuant to s 67. The assumption can hardly apply to an offence if the
                    preliminary act forming the offence itself (<em>viz</em>,
                    that the accused had <em>driven or was driving</em> the
                    vehicle) is not made out in the first place. However, once the preliminary act
                    has been proved, the assumption regarding the results of a breath or blood test
                    under s 71A ought to apply regardless of whether it was procured in the
                    course of investigation into an offence under s 67 or s 68 of the RTA.
                    In the English House of Lords decision of <em>DPP v
                        Butterworth</em> [1994] 3 WLR 538, the accused refused to
                    provide a breath sample and contended that his conviction for failure to provide
                    a sample was unsound because at the time the request was made to furnish the
                    sample, the police were still uncertain as to which particular offence he had
                    committed. The House of Lords held that the police was entitled to investigate
                    generally whether an offence had been committed, and to contend that the police
                    had to have a particular offence in mind before a request for a sample could be
                    made would impose, on the police, an unnecessary burden at a point before they
                    even knew whether the person had exceeded the limit of whatever statutory
                    offence they were investigating. We would adopt the same approach in the local
                    context. It would be unduly restrictive to require the police to decide in
                    advance what offence an accused was going to be charged with when the whole
                    purpose of the taking of the breath and blood specimen was to determine whether
                    an offence under s 67 or 68 of the RTA was likely to have taken place in
                    the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Counsel for the Respondent also suggested that
                    the phrase “at the time of the alleged <em>offence</em>” [emphasis added] in s 71A of the RTA
                    referred to the time the accused was <em>arrested</em>. In
                    other words, the assumption is that the proportion of alcohol in the
                    accused’s breath or blood is not less than in the specimen at the time of
                    the arrest rather than at the time of the driving for the purposes of an offence
                    under s 67 of the RTA. We find this argument to be wholly without merit.
                    First, it equated (or, rather, conflated) the meaning of “offence”
                    with that of “arrest”. This cannot be correct as the act which
                    constitutes the “offence” is not the arrest as such but, rather,
                    the drink driving. Secondly, the purpose of establishing an assumption was to
                    assist the Prosecution in surmounting the (otherwise extremely difficult)
                    evidential hurdle of demonstrating that an accused was unfit to drive. This
                    purpose would be entirely frustrated if “time of the offence” were
                    interpreted to mean the point or time of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Exercise of discretion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As there is an overlap in the ingredients of a
                    s 67 offence and a s 68 offence, the Prosecution has an absolute
                    discretion to decide which offence it will charge the offender with in any
                    particular case. The court cannot interfere with its decision, but we would
                    imagine that if the Prosecution invariably uses s 67 of the RTA for every
                    case where a driver is found sitting or sleeping in a motor vehicle by the side
                    of the road, it may actually encourage drink drivers not to stop driving and
                    continue on his or her journey in the hope that he or she would arrive safely at
                    his destination. This is obviously a situation the Prosecution may want to avoid
                    and therefore we would think that it would take this consideration into account
                    in exercising its discretion in the circumstances of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     For the reasons set out above, we answered the
                    question posed by the Public Prosecutor in the affirmative and restored the
                    sentence of the District Judge.</p>
