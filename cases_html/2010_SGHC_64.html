<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This suit was a culmination of one of several
                    disputes involving Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd (“the
                    plaintiff”) and its shareholders and directors. In these proceedings, the
                    plaintiff is suing Lian Hwee Choo Phebe (“Phebe Lian”), its
                    shareholder and former director, for breach of director’s duties. The
                    plaintiff alleged that Phebe Lian had sent a letter to Malayan Banking Berhad
                    (“Maybank”) prompting Maybank to refrain from refinancing the
                    plaintiff’s banking/credit facilities, thereby causing loss to the
                    plaintiff. The plaintiff also accused Phebe Lian of acting in conflict of
                    interest by causing her company, Corporate United Limited (“CUL”),
                    to extend a $1m Standby Letter of Credit (“SBLC”) in favour of the
                    plaintiff at a cost of $53,664. The plaintiff sought substantial damages
                    ($15,666,372.76) from Phebe Lian in the alternative damages to be
                    assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is an investment holding company
                    with no business operations of its own. In January 2005, after encouragement
                    from her friend Benedict Kusni (“Kusni”), Phebe Lian made a
                    capital injection of $100,000 into the plaintiff through her corporate vehicle,
                    Phebe Investment Pte Ltd in return for 10% of the plaintiff’s shares,
                    thereby making her an indirect shareholder of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the material time, the plaintiff was managed
                    and controlled by one Seeto Keong (“Seeto”) and one Sebastian Wong
                    Cheen Pong (“Sebastian”). Seeto was the plaintiff’s director
                    and chief executive officer, while Sebastian was its financial controller. At
                    the trial (under cross-examination), Seeto agreed that Sebastian was a <em>de facto</em> director of the plaintiff. Both Seeto and Kusni
                    held shares in the plaintiff. Sebastian indirectly held shares in the plaintiff
                    through his wife and daughter because he was facing bankruptcy proceedings (and
                    was eventually made a bankrupt in early 2005).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In early 2005, the plaintiff was given the
                    opportunity to take over the lease of and to redevelop a hotel at 23 Beach View,
                    Sentosa (“the Hotel”). The Hotel was, at the time, owned by Sijori
                    Resort (Sentosa) Pte Ltd (“Sijori”) and the lessor of the land on
                    which the Hotel stood was Sentosa Development Corporation (“SDC”).
                    It was decided that the plaintiff’s subsidiary, Treasure Resort Pte Ltd
                    (“Treasure Resort”), would acquire the Hotel and have it managed
                    by the Movenpick group of hotel operators (which does not have a presence in
                    Singapore). Even though Phebe Lian was a minority shareholder of the plaintiff,
                    she provided substantial financial assistance for the acquisition apart from
                    which, the plaintiff relied almost entirely on borrowed funds. The financial
                    assistance rendered by Phebe Lian is summarised in the following three
                    paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 13 May 2005, Phebe Lian provided the
                    plaintiff with an SBLC for $200,000 which the plaintiff used as collateral for a
                    $200,000 credit facility from OCBC. The SBLC was provided by CUL and it was to
                    be discharged in six months <em>viz</em> by November 2005.
                    On 17 November 2005, through CUL, Phebe Lian also provided the plaintiff
                    with an interest free loan of $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 11 May 2006, Phebe Lian was made a
                    director of the plaintiff. The management of the plaintiff still remained
                    primarily in the hands of Seeto and Sebastian although Phebe Lian now had an
                    additional reason to assist the plaintiff. In June 2006, the plaintiff obtained
                    an $8m loan from Moscow Narodny Bank Limited which was subsequently renamed VTB
                    Bank Europe (“VTB”). In order to convince VTB to extend the loan,
                    the plaintiff had to demonstrate that it had funds of its own. To that end,
                    Seeto caused the plaintiff to borrow $1m from Sit Ley Timber Pte Ltd. The
                    plaintiff, however, could not meet the condition of Sit Ley Timber Pte Ltd to
                    pay $100,000 upfront as interest and the arrangement fell through. To assist the
                    plaintiff, Phebe Lian provided the plaintiff, again through CUL, an SBLC for
                    $1m, which enabled the plaintiff to obtain a $1m credit facility from the
                    Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”). The deadline for
                    this SBLC to be discharged was 30 November 2006 but, at the
                    plaintiff’s request, it was extended to 28 February
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Phebe Lian also stood as a guarantor for the
                    plaintiff. In November 2006, the plaintiff obtained a loan of $5m from
                    Maybank which was secured by (a) a joint and several guarantee for the sum by
                    Phebe Lian and Seeto and (b) two Insurance Guarantee Bonds for an amount
                    totalling $5m from See Hoy Chan Capital Limited
                (“SHC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 14 November 2006, Treasure Resorts
                    entered into a Novation Agreement with Sijori and a Supplemental Agreement with
                    SDC the effect of which was to make Treasure Resorts the lessee of the land on
                    which the Hotel stood. In the same month, Phebe Lian began making enquiries
                    about the plaintiff’s financial status. At the time, the plaintiff had (i)
                    an $8m loan from VTB; (ii) a $5m loan from Maybank; and (iii) a $1.2m loan from
                    the OCBC. Despite having substantial funds, the SBLC of $200,000 issued by CUL
                    in May 2005 was not discharged. Further, the date of repayment of Phebe
                    Lian’s loan of $100,000 (which had been extended for 2 weeks in November
                    2005) had to be extended yet again and was only repaid in May 2006; the date of
                    discharge of the $1m SBLC also had to be extended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Yet, Phebe Lian noticed that Seeto and Sebastian
                    were driving brand new seven and five series BMW cars respectively, which they
                    obtained in October and December 2006 from the local distributor Performance
                    Motors Ltd, on hire purchase financing, paid by the plaintiff. In
                    Sebastian’s case, he registered the vehicle in his daughter’s name
                    as by 13 January 2005, he had been adjudged a bankrupt. Further, Seeto and
                    Sebastian each acquired a condominium apartment. At that time, the plaintiff had
                    no income and while it had funds, these were all borrowed moneys a portion of
                    which came from Phebe Lian. Although there was also no agreement for directors
                    to be remunerated, in the course of Seeto’s cross-examination, it was
                    revealed that he paid himself $6,000 ‘allowance’ a month while
                    Sebastian was paid $5,000 by the plaintiff. Not surprisingly, Phebe Lian began
                    to harbour suspicions of the source of Seeto and Sebastian’s new found
                    wealth and started to make enquiries. She questioned Seeto and Sebastian as to
                    how the plaintiff’s funds were being utilised and how the plaintiff
                    intended to repay CUL. In addition, she sought to examine the plaintiff’s
                    accounts and to be made a co-signatory to the plaintiff’s bank accounts.
                    Seeto and Sebastian ignored her enquiries and her requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 19 January 2007, CUL sought repayment
                    of its loans. When the moneys were not repaid, Phebe Lian became more anxious
                    and suspicious as to how the plaintiff’s finances were being managed.
                    Phebe Lian was particularly anxious because not only was she a director of the
                    plaintiff, she was also a joint-guarantor of the plaintiff’s $5m loan and
                    had, through CUL, provided the plaintiff with financial assistance of a sum
                    totalling $1.3m without security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After further fruitless attempts to obtain
                    information from Seeto and/or Sebastian with regard to the plaintiff’s
                    financial status, Phebe Lian sent a letter to the plaintiff’s bankers
                    (including Maybank) dated 29 January 2007 (“the letter”) to
                    informed the banks that she would be making an inquiry into the
                    plaintiff’s financial affairs and that the banks should not act on the
                    instructions of the plaintiff unless those instructions bore her authorising
                    signature. In the letter, Phebe Lian mistakenly described herself as the
                    “managing director” of the company. On 7 February 2007, she
                    wrote to the banks to seek copies of the plaintiff’s bank statements and
                    to correct her earlier mistake in the letter by clarifying that she was only a
                    director of the plaintiff and not its managing director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 30 January 2007, Phebe Lian’s
                    lawyers wrote to Seeto expressing concern at the fact that she had yet to
                    receive any of the plaintiff’s financial reports and that her repeated
                    requests for information pertaining to the company’s finances had been
                    refused or ignored. Phebe Lian’s lawyers demanded that the
                    plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1)    furnish [Phebe Lian] with [the plaintiff’s]
                            financial accounts for the years 2005 and 2006;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2)    furnish [Phebe Lian] with a copy of all the minutes
                            and resolutions passed by the Board of Directors and shareholders in the
                            year 2006;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3)    furnish [Phebe Lian] with a copy of [the
                            plaintiff’s] bank statements for the year 2006; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4)    cause to be passed, the necessary directors’
                            resolution to remove sole signatories to [the plaintiff’s] bank
                            accounts and to authorise [the plaintiff’s] bank accounts to be
                            operated only by joint signatories, one of whom shall be [Phebe
                            Lian].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Legal action was threatened if the above conditions were not
                    satisfied within 5 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After Phebe Lian had written to the banks and
                    to Seeto, Seeto and Sebastian responded in several emails to try to assuage her
                    concerns. In an email sent on 30 January 2007, Seeto expressed his hope that
                    their business relationship will not “fall apart” and informed
                    Phebe Lian that he had already directed Sebastian to prepare board resolutions
                    to add her as a signatory to the plaintiff’s bank accounts. He also
                    apologised to her and in doing so stated the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, i offer my apology to you if i had probably cause you to feel
                        uneasy in anyway. I maintain my statement that you are the director of [the
                        plaintiff] i respected and will still be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sebastian also wrote to Phebe Lian in an email
                    dated 6 February 2007 stating, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that he would:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…change bank signatories for VTB Bank Europe plc (formerly known as
                        Moscow Narodny Bank) and Maybank to jointly between you and Seeto Keong
                        instead of singly any one and to add your signatory to OCBC to be signed
                        between yourself, Seeto Keong or Sebastian, any two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He also added that he would:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… improve corporate governance by setting up an Executive Committee
                        to veto and pass all capital expenditures and investments and also
                        appointment of Senior management staff for the group and its
                        subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Seeto’s reply to the letter of
                    30 January 2007 from Phebe Lian’s lawyers (quoted in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), however, manifested a different
                    attitude. He was evasive and stated that the request be redirected to the
                    plaintiff and not to himself in his personal capacity even though the
                    solicitors’ letter had expressly acknowledged the fact that Seeto was CEO
                    of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Despite this series of correspondence, Phebe
                    Lian still did not receive any information regarding the plaintiff’s
                    accounts. Instead, she was removed by Seeto as a director of the plaintiff at an
                    Extra-ordinary General Meeting held on 15 March 2007, with the support of
                    Sebastian’s daughter (who held shares in the plaintiff on his behalf) and
                    Kusni.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the same month, Sebastian’s
                    negotiations with Maybank’s Darren Tan to refinance its existing loans to
                    the tune of $15m failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In May 2007, Seeto and Sebastian transferred
                    their shares in the plaintiff to Roscent Group Holdings
                    (“Roscent”), a company controlled by one Tan Boon Kian
                    (“Rodney Tan”), who eventually became the majority shareholder and
                    a director of the plaintiff when the plaintiff could not repay his loans. In
                    that same month, CUL commenced legal action against the plaintiff to compel the
                    company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to the issuance of the SBLCs
                    amounting to $1.2m. The plaintiff eventually paid CUL $1.2m and CUL discontinued
                    its suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 2 August 2007, Maybank granted
                    Treasure Resorts a loan of $26.1m to enable the latter to refinance the loans
                    that the plaintiff had taken to fund Treasure Resorts’ acquisition of and
                    the necessary renovation and refurbishment works for the Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 8 January 2008, Phebe Lian and Kok Lan
                    Choo, the other minority shareholder of the plaintiff, commenced Originating
                    Summons No 18 of 2008 (“the OS”) against the plaintiff (as a
                    nominal defendant) and the controlling shareholders and directors of the
                    plaintiff (which included Seeto and Rodney Tan) seeking relief under s 216
                    of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies
                    Act”) for oppression. The OS was subsequently converted to Suit
                    No 75 of 2008. On 1 August 2008, Phebe Lian and Kok Lan Choo commenced
                    Suit No 536 of 2008 (“Suit 536”) against the plaintiff (as
                    nominal defendant) and the other directors/shareholders including Seeto,
                    Sebastian and Rodney Tan, for conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 11 September 2008, barely six weeks
                    after Suit 536 was filed, the plaintiff commenced the present action against
                    Phebe Lian for breach of her director’s duties by sending the letter to
                    Maybank, alleging that this had caused Maybank to refuse to go ahead with the
                    refinancing of its banking/credit facilities (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). Phebe
                    Lian was further accused of placing herself in a conflict of interest situation
                    by causing CUL to extend the $1m SBLC at a cost of $53,664 to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Not surprisingly, Phebe Lian denied the
                    plaintiff’s allegations. In her defence (Amendment No 2), she
                    contended that the directors of the plaintiff brought these proceedings in bad
                    faith with a view to enabling any one or more of them to lend money to the
                    plaintiff for the purpose of financing the proceedings and then to convert the
                    loan to equity in the plaintiff at an undervalue. She averred that such conduct
                    amounted to an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did Phebe Lian breach her director’s duties by sending the
                letter of 29 January 2007 to Maybank?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     From the outset, it was obvious that the
                    plaintiff’s case was weak and its many improbable allegations and claims
                    put forward by Seeto lent weight to Phebe Lian’s counsel’s
                    contention that these proceedings were nothing more than a retaliatory suit
                    brought in response to Suit 536. With regard to its claim that Phebe Lian had
                    scuttled the refinancing deal with Maybank by sending the letter, the
                    plaintiff’s pleaded case was that Maybank’s representative, one
                    Francis Wong, had <em>orally</em> informed Sebastian that
                    the bank would not be refinancing the plaintiff’s banking/credit
                    facilities because of what appeared to be a brewing shareholders’ dispute.
                    In other words, evidence of the causal link between the letter and
                    Maybank’s decision not to refinance the plaintiff’s bank/credit
                    facilities was reposed in Francis Wong and Sebastian. Yet, neither person was
                    called to testify. For that reason, Phebe Lian’s counsel invited the court
                    to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff under s 116(g) of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) for not calling Sebastian as a witness
                    even though he was still in the plaintiff’s employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, even if no such adverse inference
                    is drawn (although I did draw such inference), the plaintiff still could not/did
                    not prove its case. Its claim was a non-starter because, in the absence of
                    testimony by Francis Wong or Sebastian, there was insufficient evidence which
                    would have enabled this court to make a finding that Phebe Lian’s actions
                    had caused the plaintiff’s loss. On this point alone, the
                    plaintiff’s claim pertaining to its purported loss caused by
                    Maybank’s refusal to refinance fails <em>in
                        limine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I note that in his Affidavit of
                    Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), Seeto had deposed that Maybank’s
                    representative had orally informed Sebastian <em>and
                        him</em> of the reasons for Maybank’s decision. Seeto’s
                    evidence was an untruth. This was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case (which
                    was limited to the plea that Maybank’s representative had informed
                    Sebastian). In my view, this was an afterthought included by Seeto in his AEIC
                    to bolster the plaintiff’s flimsy claim. Indeed, this was one of many
                    instances where Seeto economised on the truth in the course of the trial. Under
                    rigorous cross-examination, Seeto finally conceded that there had been no letter
                    of offer or even a verbal offer in December 2006 from Maybank, to refinance the
                    plaintiff’s banking/credit facilities. Simply put, if there was no
                    evidence of an offer to refinance, there was nothing to scuttle. In this regard,
                    it may be possible in a case with more evidence, for a director to be found to
                    be in breach of his duties by acting in a way so as to jeopardize an inchoate
                    deal, but it will not be possible to make this finding here where the evidence
                    of any such deal was lacking and where there was nothing to show any causal link
                    between the acts of the director and the failure of the deal to
                    materialise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Further, in my view, not only did Phebe Lian
                    not breach her director’s duties, she had acted <em>consistently</em> within her duties and responsibilities as a
                    director by sending the letter to the banks. Phebe Lian had written to the banks
                    because she was concerned with the financial status of the plaintiff. Seeto and
                    Sebastian were stonewalling her inquiries by ignoring her repeated requests for
                    information (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). In the
                    circumstances, it was not only reasonable for Phebe Lian to write to the banks
                    but quite proper for her to do so as a director, to try to uncover any financial
                    irregularities given the suspicious circumstances (set out at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Counsel for the plaintiff sought to make much
                    of the fact that Phebe Lian had wrongly identified herself as the
                    “managing director” of the plaintiff in the letter. I accept Phebe
                    Lian’s explanation that this was an innocent mistake and note that her
                    explanation was supported by her subsequent letter of 7 February 2009
                    to the banks in which she clarified that she was merely a director of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is to be noted that on 2 August 2007,
                    Maybank had gone ahead to provide a $26.1m loan to Treasure Resorts, the
                    plaintiff’s subsidiary (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>
                    above). If indeed the letter had so shaken the faith of Maybank in the
                    creditworthiness of the plaintiff, it is highly unlikely that Maybank would have
                    extended a massive loan of $26.1m to its subsidiary. This was yet another reason
                    why I find the plaintiff’s claim to be unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Consequently, I dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    claim against Phebe Lian for breach of her director’s duties
                    pertaining to her sending of the letter to the banks and Maybank in
                    particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did Phebe Lian breach her duties by causing CUL to extend the $1m
                SBLC at a cost of $53,664 to the plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff’s counsel focussed his
                    energy in the course of the seven-day trial on the claim for $53,664 paid to CUL
                    in return for the $1m SBLC. Ordinarily, this would have been surprising given
                    the fact that this claim formed an insignificant percentage of the total claim
                    for damages of over $15m. However it was not, given the frivolity of the
                    plaintiff’s primary claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s case with regard to this
                    claim for $53,664 was that Phebe Lian had acted in conflict of interest by
                    causing CUL to extend the $1m SBLC at a cost of $53,664 to the plaintiff. The
                    plaintiff took the position that Phebe Lian had concealed her interests in CUL
                    so that the plaintiff’s other directors did not know that she was the
                    owner of CUL. However, Phebe Lian had testified that she had openly revealed her
                    status as owner of CUL to the staff who worked in the plaintiff’s office,
                    including Seeto and Sebastian. I believe her testimony. It is inconceivable that
                    Seeto and Sebastian could have been unaware that CUL was owned by Phebe Lian. It
                    bears noting that CUL had given the plaintiff financial assistance not once but
                    on numerous occasions. CUL had provided the plaintiff with SBLCs of up to $1.2m
                    followed by an interest-free unsecured loan of $100,000 on 17 November
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     When asked if he was curious as to why CUL was
                    rendering assistance to the plaintiff, Seeto claimed that he had thought that
                    CUL “was a really friendly party”. This answer was unconvincing if
                    not totally incredible. Seeto could not have been so naïve. The only reason why
                    CUL was willing to render financial assistance to the plaintiff, to the extent
                    of making an unsecured interest-free loan of $100,000, was due to the fact that
                    Phebe Lian was the owner of CUL. Phebe Lian caused CUL to help the plaintiff
                    because she was a director and shareholder of the plaintiff and Seeto and
                    Sebastian well knew this fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In fact, it was precisely because Seeto and
                    Sebastian were aware that Phebe Lian owned CUL that they had approached her on
                    2 December 2005 at her home in Telok Kurau to seek her help in getting CUL
                    to extend the date of repayment of the $100,000 loan for two months. Phebe Lian
                    had tendered in evidence a letter which Sebastian had prepared and which he and
                    Seeto had brought to Phebe Lian’s home for her to sign on that occasion.
                    The letter reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was subsequently discovered that such a
                    letter was not required for an extension of the loan because CUL’s account
                    with American Express Bank Ltd (“AMEX”) was an overdraft account
                    and there was no time limit for the loan to be repaid. Nonetheless, this letter
                    demonstrated that Seeto and Sebastian knew that Phebe Lian (referred to as
                    “Jennifer” which was her alternative name) was in control of CUL.
                    Seeto had raised the lame excuse that in his view, Phebe Lian was merely a
                    “link person to CUL” and that he did not know who owned CUL.
                    Again, I reject his explanation. I find that Seeto and Sebastian knew that Phebe
                    Lian was the owner of CUL and that this was why they had approached her to write
                    to AMEX to extend the $100,000 loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for the $1m SBLC, after the plaintiff had
                    agreed to pay the sum of $53,664 to CUL on 9 November 2006, Seeto had
                    attended an informal meeting with Phebe Lian, Kusni and Sebastian. At that
                    meeting, Sebastian produced two typewritten notes to explain the cash flow
                    situation of the plaintiff for November and December 2006. The note for November
                    2006 recorded, <em>inter alia</em>, a sum of $53,664 to be
                    paid as “Interest for $1 million (Jennifer)”. In my view, this
                    note, along with the evidence considered above (at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> to <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>) demonstrated
                    that the other directors of the plaintiff were aware all along that Phebe Lian
                    was the owner of CUL and that they had in fact sought assistance from her to
                    cause CUL to provide financial aid to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my view, the fact that the directors of the
                    plaintiff knew of Phebe Lian’s interest in CUL absolved her of any
                    liability for conflict of interest pertaining to CUL’s receipt of the
                    $53,664 in return for providing the $1m SBLC. Where the directors of a company
                    know of another director’s interest in a particular transaction, the
                    failure of that director to make a formal disclosure to the other directors does
                    not make the director liable for breach of his fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The above proposition is supported by the
                    Australian case of <em>Woolworths Ltd v Kelly</em> (1991) 4
                    ACSR 431 (“<em>Woolworths</em>”) where the
                    respondent, Kelly, was the chairman of the board of directors of a public
                    company. In February 1975, the board agreed to establish a pension scheme under
                    which Kelly would be entitled to $26,000 per annum. In 1979, the board decided
                    to increase the annual entitlement by $8,666 per annum to reflect the fact that
                    Kelly was owed $60,000 by the company for his provision of consultancy services.
                    There was a change in the board of the company and the new board resolved that
                    payments to Kelly should be substantially reduced. Kelly sued the company to
                    enforce his contractual right to receive his pension at the original rate. Kelly
                    succeeded at first instance; and on appeal, the company argued that Kelly had
                    failed to make a formal disclosure of his interest in the contract as required
                    by s 123 of the Australian Companies Act 1961 (which is in <em>pari materia</em> to s 156 of the Companies Act). The
                    Court of Appeal of New South Wales held, by a majority, that no disclosure was
                    necessary where the nature of the interest was known to the other directors.
                    Likewise, in <em>Lee Panavision Ltd v Lee Lightning
                        Ltd</em> [1992] BCLC 22 (“<em>Lee
                        Panavision</em>”), Dillon LJ (with whom the other members
                    of the English Court of Appeal agreed), doubted whether the non-disclosure of an
                    interest common to all the directors and <em>ex
                        hypothesi</em> known to all of them would be a breach of the English
                    equivalent of s 156(1) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff had cited the decision in
                        <em>Dayco Products Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ong
                        Cheng Aik</em> [2004] 4SLR(R) 318, in which the court (at [18])
                    regarded as unsustainable in law the proposition that informal disclosure or
                    knowledge is sufficient to satisfy the disclosure requirements under
                    s 156(1) of the Companies Act. However, that was not a case where there was
                    in fact informal disclosure to the board of directors of the errant
                    director’s interest in certain transactions. Further, no reference was
                    made in that case to the decisions in <em>Woolworths</em>
                    and <em>Lee Panavision</em> which I find persuasive. In
                    this regard I agree with the view expressed in <em>Walter Woon on
                        Company Law</em> (Singapore: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., 2005) at pp 287-288 and <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6
                    (Singapore: Butterworths Asia, 2000) at para 70.247 that there is no reason
                    why the position in <em>Woolworths</em> and <em>Lee Panavision</em> should not hold good in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Accordingly, I find that Phebe Lian was not in
                    breach of her director’s duties by causing CUL to extend the $1m SBLC in
                    favour of the plaintiff in return for the $53,664. I should add that I found the
                    position taken by Seeto on the stand to be reprehensible – he and
                    Sebastian had sought the help of Phebe Lian (having done so several times
                    previously) and had offered the payment of $53,664 to CUL in return for the $1m
                    SBLC which the plaintiff desperately needed. Yet Seeto subsequently took the
                    position that the defendant had acted in conflict of interest. That, in my view,
                    was an extraordinary act of ingratitude; it was a proverbial case of a dog that
                    bit the hand that fed it. Both Seeto and Sebastian (even before his bankruptcy)
                    were men of straw. Had Maybank called upon the joint and several guarantees
                    furnished by Seeto and Phebe Lian for its loan of $5m, Maybank would in all
                    probabilities have pursued Phebe Lian for its claim as Seeto’s guarantee
                    was unlikely to be worth the paper it was written on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     What this court found to be even more galling
                    was the fact that Seeto and the plaintiff’s other directors sued Phebe
                    Lian here over payment of a mere $53,664 for a loan from CUL of $1m that was not
                    repaid for more than a year. As a percentage of $1m, $53,664 was equivalent to
                    5%. Yet, they were prepared to and did use, the plaintiff’s borrowed funds
                    to pay one Wong Nam Sing interest amounting to $128,000 or 51% for a four week
                    loan of $250,000 which, calculated over twelve months, equated to a staggering
                    interest rate of 612% per annum. In addition, Seeto admitted that during the
                    hearing of Suit 536 before another court, he revealed that he and Sebastian had
                    taken a loan of $1.9m for the plaintiff from Rodney Tan in or about May 2007,
                    for which they agreed to pay Rodney Tan 5% interest per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Consequently, I dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    claims with costs to Phebe Lian to be taxed on a standard basis unless otherwise
                    agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I shall hear further arguments from the
                    parties as to why Seeto and the other directors of the plaintiff should not be
                    made personally liable for Phebe Lian’s costs. It is my finding that this
                    suit was indeed a retaliatory tactic by Seeto, Sebastian and Rodney Tan for what
                    they considered to be Phebe Lian’s temerity in suing them in Suit 536. As
                    it was instituted by the company’s directors in bad faith, I see no reason
                    why the plaintiff should be liable for and its funds used to pay, the costs due
                    to Phebe Lian.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Supplemental Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">19 April 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Pursuant to para 42 of my judgment dated
                    26 February 2010, Phebe Lian’s solicitors applied for arguments on
                    costs, and gave notice to the directors of the plaintiff, in particular Rodney
                    Tan, Seeto, Sebastian as well as Lim Kwee Wah (“Lim”) when the
                    court fixed a hearing date which was on 15 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff and its three directors were
                    present in court via their counsel. The three directors who were represented
                    were Rodney Tan, Seeto and Lim while Sebastian appeared in person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The court was informed by counsel for Phebe
                    Lian, Mr Srinivasan, that Justice Andrew Ang (“Ang J”)
                    had on 1 February 2010 delivered oral judgment in Suit 536 in favour of
                    Phebe Lian and her co-plaintiff Kok Lan Choo (‘Kok”). Ang J
                    found that Rodney Tan, Seeto, Lim, Sebastian together with the fifth defendant
                    in the suit, Cairnhill Treasure Investment (S) Pte Ltd (“Cairnhill
                    Treasure”) (a company which belongs to Rodney Tan) had conducted the
                    affairs of the plaintiff (the first defendant in Suit 536) in a manner
                    oppressive to Phebe Lian and Kok.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Consequently, Ang J ordered a buy-out of
                    the shares of Phebe Lian in the plaintiff by Rodney Tan and Cairnhill Treasure.
                    Ang J directed that an independent valuer was to be appointed by mutual
                    agreement to value the shares of Phebe Lian and Kok in that regard. Ang J
                    not only ordered costs to be paid to Phebe Lian and Kok by Seeto, Lim and
                    Sebastian for Suit 536 (being costs that followed the event) but went further to
                    direct that Rodney Tan, Seeto, Lim, Sebastian and Cairnhill Treasure were to
                    reimburse in full the plaintiff for all fees, costs, expenses and disbursements
                    that were incurred and charged to the plaintiff arising out of or in connection
                    with Phebe Lian’s and Kok’s complaints. He reserved costs until
                    final resolution of the matter with regard to the proceedings against Rodney Tan
                    and Cairnhill Treasure. I should point out that Rodney Tan/Cairnhill Treasure
                    and Lim have appealed against Ang J’s judgment in Civil Appeals
                    No 30 of 2010 and No 32 of 2010 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This court was further informed that
                    Ang J after delivery of his oral judgment in Suit 536 had, in a subsequent
                    hearing in March 2010, informed parties that the valuation date for the buy-out
                    of the shares of Phebe Lian and Kok would either be December 2007 or
                    1 February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Kronenburg (counsel for the plaintiff)
                    informed the court that his client adopted a neutral stand on the issue of costs
                    and left the decision to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Srinivasan referred to
                    Ang J’s judgment and informed the court that Ang J had set aside
                    the first rights issue but allowed the second rights issue of the plaintiff to
                    stand. Prior to the first rights issue (in January 2008) Phebe Lian owned about
                    18.18% of the plaintiff’s shares. Pursuant to the second rights issue (in
                    June 2008), her interest had been diluted to 3.42%. That being the case,
                    Mr Srinivasan indicated that Phebe Lian would not object if the court
                    ordered the plaintiff to pay her costs in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Although he accepted that O 59
                    r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”) gave the court full powers to determine by whom and
                    to what extent costs are to be paid, counsel for Rodney Tan argued (which
                    arguments counsel for Seeto and Lim adopted as applicable to their clients) that
                    this court should not make any order for costs against his client personally for
                    the reasons that appear in <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> to <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     First, orders for costs against non-parties
                    were exceptional and rarely appropriate. It should not be made without
                    sufficient (advance) warning to non-parties who are asked to pay the costs.
                    Here, no such notice was given by Phebe Lian save that in the concluding
                    para 34 of her opening statement dated 13 November 2009, she contended
                    that the plaintiff’s claim was “probably instituted by those in
                    control of the plaintiff in retaliation against the defendant for commencing an
                    action against them for their oppressive behaviour”. It was later raised
                    briefly by her counsel (in the midst of cross-examination of Seeto on
                    24 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>), when he indicated he would address this
                    court on third parties paying costs in the event his client won this suit.
                    Rodney Tan was not a witness in this case and had no opportunity to respond to
                    the allegation that this suit was a form of retaliation against Phebe
                    Lian.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Second, courts would be willing to order costs
                    against a non-party director where a company which is a party to litigation is
                    insolvent and where the non-party director had caused the company to improperly
                    prosecute or defend proceedings. This was not the case here as the plaintiff is
                    solvent and Phebe Lian would not be prejudiced by the usual order for costs to
                    be paid to her by the unsuccessful plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Third, the directors of the plaintiff had
                    sought and obtained legal advice not from one but two law firms that the
                    plaintiff had a valid claim against Phebe Lian before commencement of this suit
                    (see <em>In re Land and Property Trust Co plc No.2</em>
                    [1993] BCC 462).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Counsel pointed out that the plaintiff was
                    practically insolvent before Rodney Tan came into the picture in or about
                    May/June 2007 and injected $26m-$28m (which sum was disputed by Phebe
                    Lian’s counsel) into the plaintiff to recapitalise the company. None of
                    the other shareholders contributed funds to the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Because of the buy-out of her shares as
                    ordered by Ang J, Phebe Lian would not be prejudiced if the plaintiff was
                    ordered to pay her costs as, regardless of whether her shares were valued as of
                    December 2007 or 1 February 2010, the present costs order would come after the
                    two dates and the remaining shareholders of the plaintiff would be the ones
                    affected thereby, not she.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Counsel (Mr See Chern Yang) for Seeto
                    adopted for his client the arguments put forth for Rodney Tan (particularly on
                    the lack of notice). He complained that because of the lack of notice, Seeto was
                    deprived of the opportunity to seek independent legal advice personally. Counsel
                    raised another issue as to why Seeto should not be made to bear the costs
                    payable to Phebe Lian. He pointed out that case-law (citing <em>Symphony Group plc v Hodgson</em> [1994] QB 179) (<em>“Symphony”</em>) supported his proposition that
                    where a party is seeking costs against a non-party, that non-party should have
                    been joined to the proceedings. Here not only did Phebe Lian not join Seeto to
                    this suit, she was attempting to pierce the corporate veil by alleging that all
                    the directors had conspired to make use of the plaintiff as a front (see [22] of
                    the judgment) by financing these proceedings. Phebe Lian could have or should
                    have brought a counterclaim in conspiracy and included Seeto as a party. She
                    failed to do so and he considered her allegation frivolous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mr See then pointed out that Seeto had
                    given up active management of the plaintiff as of June 2007. Consequently, he
                    did not actively participate in prosecuting this suit. He contended that the
                    notice given on 24 November 2009 by counsel for Phebe Lian while
                    cross-examining Seeto was not a direct warning to Seeto that Phebe Lian would be
                    seeking costs from Seeto should she win this suit. He submitted that a
                    reasonable inference by anyone in Seeto’s shoes would be that the warning
                    to seek costs from third parties excluded Seeto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The arguments raised by counsel
                    (Mr Kumar) on behalf of Lim echoed those put forward for Rodney Tan and
                    Seeto. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat them save for one new submission
                    – counsel pointed out that Lim was neither a shareholder of the plaintiff
                    nor of its subsidiary Treasure Resort; he was only a director and was never
                    involved in this suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Counsel for Phebe Lian took umbrage with the
                    claim by his counsel in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> that Rodney Tan
                    was a white knight who had injected millions into the plaintiff and turned it
                    around from an insolvent to a solvent company. Mr Srinivasan pointed out
                    that there was no evidence in this suit or in Suit 536 of such huge injections
                    of capital. He refuted the argument that Phebe Lian could have/should have sued
                    the directors personally in conspiracy by pointing out that the company as the
                    plaintiff was controlled by its directors who initiated this action. It was the
                    company that could sue the directors but would not for obvious
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As for the alleged lack of notice to the
                    directors, Mr Srinivasan pointed out (as the court had indicated to counsel
                    for Rodney Tan) that the judgment was dated and released more than a month ago
                    (on 26 February 2010). This hearing was itself notice and adequate notice
                    at that, to the directors to make submissions on the issue of their possible
                    liability for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Having heard all the arguments of the parties,
                    I ordered costs payable to Phebe Lian to be borne by the plaintiff and left it
                    to the company to recover such costs from some or all of its directors as it
                    deemed fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I had however rejected the directors’
                    complaint that they had not been given notice or adequate warning of Phebe
                    Lian’s intention to seek costs from them personally. The judgment was
                    released on 26 February 2010 and collected by both parties the very same
                    day. I had clearly identified (in <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>) of
                    the judgment who were the directors who could possibly be made personally liable
                    to bear Phebe Lian’s costs; I did not mention Lim. All three named
                    directors (Seeto, Sebastian and Rodney Tan) had more than enough notice to
                    prepare themselves for the eventuality should this court make an order for costs
                    against one or more of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As I pointed out to counsel for Rodney Tan,
                    his client could have applied to court to intervene in these proceedings after
                    the judgment was released but he did not. He (as well as Seeto and Lim) could
                    also have written to this court to raise objections to [42] of the judgment but
                    he did not. The excuse of counsel that intervening after the trial was concluded
                    would have been too late is unpersuasive. It is noteworthy that Seeto was being
                    cross-examined when counsel for Phebe Lian gave notice in no uncertain terms
                    that he would be looking to third parties to pay her costs should she win this
                    case. I cannot fathom how Seeto (as his counsel submitted) could possibly think
                    from reading the transcript of the cross-examination of 24 November 2009
                    that the notice did not apply to him. He was the only director of the plaintiff
                    to testify; such conduct further contradicts his counsel’s submission that
                    he no longer played an active role in the company’s management. Why then
                    did Rodney Tan and Sebastian not testify?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As counsel for all the directors cited
                        <em>Symphony</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>) <em>in
                        extenso</em> to support the submission that a non-party should not be
                    made to pay costs as a rule, I turn now to examine the case
                briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Symphony</em>, the
                    plaintiff company employed the defendant (Hodgson) under a contract which
                    included a term restricting him from engaging in the manufacture or supply of
                    kitchen furniture for one year after termination of his employment with the
                    plaintiff. In April 1992, the defendant accepted an offer of employment from
                    H Ltd, a competitor of the plaintiff. On 1 May 1992, the defendant
                    gave notice to the plaintiff and left its services on 8 May 1992. On the
                    advice of the solicitors of H Ltd, he then wrote to the plaintiff claiming
                    it had repudiated his contract of employment. On 11 May 1992, the plaintiff
                    issued a writ seeking damages and an injunction against the defendant. The trial
                    judge found in favour of the plaintiff’s claims and because the defendant
                    was legally aided, he granted an order for costs against H Ltd on the
                    plaintiff’s application. H Ltd appealed against the order for
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In allowing the appeal of H Ltd, the
                    Court of Appeal held that H Ltd had been deprived of the procedural
                    protection to which it would have been entitled if it had been a defendant to
                    the action, that H Ltd had been disadvantaged by the failure of the
                    plaintiff to inform it of its intention to make the application and the
                    circumstances were not such as to justify the exercise of the court’s
                    discretion to make an order for costs against H Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Counsel referred to extracts (at 192-194) of
                    Balcombe LJ’s judgment where he spelt out nine guidelines for the
                    court’s exercise of discretion in relation to payment of costs by
                    non-parties. The guidelines included points made by counsel summarised at
                        <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>, <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> and <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above. Counsel
                    for Lim also drew the court’s attention to guideline No 8 where
                    Balcombe LJ held (at 194):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that an employee, or even a director or the managing director, of
                        a company gives evidence in an action does not normally mean that the
                        company is taking part in that action, in so far as that is an allegation
                        relied upon by the party who applies for an order for costs against a
                        non-party company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I noted (as did counsel for Phebe Lian) that
                    that the trial judge made H Ltd liable for the plaintiff’s costs in
                        <em>Symphony</em> because the defendant was legally
                    aided and (presumably) because H Ltd had induced the defendant to breach
                    his contract of employment with the plaintiff, I accept this was not the
                    scenario in our case as the plaintiff was said to be solvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Another case cited on Rodney Tan’s
                    behalf was <em>Karting Club of Singapore v Mak David &amp;
                        others</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 786. There, the intervener Wee
                    was the chairman of the plaintiff, an unincorporated club. The plaintiff sought
                    a declaration that the defendants be deemed to have retired as officers and/or
                    committee members of the club. Its claim was dismissed and costs were ordered
                    against Wee personally by the trial judge as the action was initiated by him as
                    chairman in the club’s name. Wee applied to intervene in these proceedings
                    to be added as a defendant. He submitted that the costs order was improperly
                    made as he was not a party to the action. Wee’s application was dismissed.
                    Chan Sek Keong J held that s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 1985 Rev Ed) read with O 59 r 2(2) of the Rules
                        (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>) conferred on the court the power to
                    determine who should pay costs, which power was completely unfettered though it
                    had to be exercised judicially. The learned judge added at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second reason why the application was misconceived was even more
                        obvious. The plaintiffs were an unincorporated association and the applicant
                        was its chairman. He and his fellow members were the plaintiffs. The
                        applicant was found by F A Chua J to have been responsible for
                        initiating an unwarranted action in the name of the club against the
                        defendants. Accordingly, if costs had been ordered against the plaintiffs,
                        it would have meant that the successful defendants and the other members had
                        to finance the unwarranted action brought at the instigation of the
                        applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I had entertained the same fears as the trial
                    judge in <em>Karting Club of Singapore v Mak David</em>. If
                    not for Ang J’s judgment in Suit 536, Phebe Lian would have been
                    prejudiced had I ordered costs against the plaintiff in which she held 18.18%
                    shares. The outcome of Suit 536 having overtaken this hearing on the issue of
                    costs, the possible prejudice against Phebe Lian no longer
                existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Consequently, I granted the usual order that
                    the unsuccessful party <em>viz</em> the plaintiff should
                    pay the costs of the action on a standard basis to the successful defendant
                    Phebe Lian to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.</p>
