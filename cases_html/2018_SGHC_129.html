The Plaintiff continued to distribute DSM products in Thailand and the distributorship arrangement was confirmed by the letter dated 31 July 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In these circumstances, I make the observation that there is some vagueness or lack of clarity on the core terms that governed the distributorship arrangement between the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant such as whether the Plaintiff was an exclusive distributor (and, if so, what exclusive distributor meant); reporting obligations; duties imposed on the Plaintiff to develop the Thai market; duties imposed on the 1st Defendant to assist the Plaintiff; and termination provisions including notice periods, rights of parties post-termination and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Take, for example, the basic question of whether the Plaintiff was appointed as an exclusive or sole distributor and in respect of what range of DSM products.

</div> it appears that this was not, in fact, the case. At the very least, it is unclear what is meant by “exclusive distributor” in this context. It is evident that the Defendants from time to time made decisions on which DSM products would be made available to any given appointed distributor for a given market. For example, the Plaintiff was in earlier years also a distributor for DSM personal care products in Thailand. As will be seen, towards the end of 2010, the decision was made to transfer that product range to another Thai distributor.

The Confidentiality Agreement expressly excludes confidential information which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, at the time of disclosure is in the public domain; which becomes part of the public domain after disclosure other than through breach by the receiving party; or which is developed by the receiving party independently from the confidential information received.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Duties imposed on the receiving party include the obligation to keep the confidential information confidential, as well as a duty not to use the confidential information for any other purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Clause 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement deals with the duration of the agreement.

</div> is that it was the 2nd Defendant who had taken the initiative to require a confidentiality agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is clear that by 2012, a considerable amount of information must have passed between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant in connection with orders for DSM products, customers, production issues, sales targets, market development and the like. A lot of information would have been disclosed at quarterly meetings between the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant. In addition, it is likely that the parties would have had specific discussions and communications on bespoke premix requests for some customers such as the formulation of the bespoke premixes as well as regulatory and other matters. It goes without saying that the 2nd Defendant, in particular, would have been concerned to safeguard any confidential information that it might disclose in relation to product formulations and production methods, whether these related to standard ingredients/premixes or bespoke premixes. This explains why the preamble to the Confidentiality Agreement states that DSM has developed and possesses certain proprietary information relating to <span class="font-italic">its products</span> whilst the Plaintiff has developed certain proprietary information relating to <span class="font-italic">its business</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This is the context in which the Confidentiality Agreement was raised, discussed, negotiated and eventually signed on 22 October 2013.

</div> Nonetheless, it does not appear that the Plaintiff disputes the fact that orders placed by the Plaintiff were subject to the GTC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Briefly, the GTC’s terms include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 1 deals with general provisions, including one stating that the GTC governs the offer, sale and delivery of all goods and services from the 1st Defendant to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 2.1 deals with quotations, orders and confirmation, and includes a provision that “[o]rders shall be deemed to be an offer by [the Plaintiff] to purchase the Products from DSM and are not binding until accepted by DSM in writing”, and that “DSM shall be entitled to refuse an order without indicating the reasons.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 3 deals with prices. It provides that prices are as set out in the confirmed order, and that unless prices are indicated as firm in the confirmed order, DSM is entitled in certain stated circumstances to increase the price of products yet to be delivered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 4 deals with payment and customer’s credit. It provides that unless otherwise stated in the confirmed order, payment is to be paid on the basis of net cash within 30 days following DSM’s invoice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Clause 22 deals with intellectual property and provides, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that “[a]ll intellectual property rights arising out of or in connection with the Products shall be the exclusive property of DSM.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Clause 19.1 of the GTC also provides an express choice for the laws of Thailand to govern the rights and obligations arising out of a confirmed order. In addition, cl 19.2 provides that the “any suits, actions or proceedings that may be instituted by any party shall be initiated exclusively before the competent courts of Bangkok … without prejudice to DSM’s right to submit the matter to any other competent court.” Unlike the Confidentiality Agreement which is governed by Singapore law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, the confirmed purchase orders between the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant are subject to the laws of Thailand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I note that there is nothing in the GTC which imposes on the 1st Defendant any obligation to accept an order placed by the Plaintiff.

Take, for example, a case where confidential information is imparted by X to Y under a contract and Y, in breach, discloses the information to Z. In such circumstances, Z may be subject to an equitable obligation of confidentiality even though he is not a party to the contract. There are, of course, many other cases where equity’s intervention is relied on to protect confidential information in the hands of a recipient or taker of confidential information (see <span class="font-italic">Invenpro</span> at [131]), but it is not necessary in the present case to examine this area in detail. The general point is that it is common for disputes over confidential information to be brought in both contract and equity. In many cases, the basic facts are the same or closely related. In some cases, the claimant is able to succeed both on the contractual claim for breach of confidence and also in equity. It is worth bearing in mind that whilst there can be no double recovery by the Plaintiff, the fact that the breach of duty is founded in both contract and equity can be significant for determining the available or appropriate remedies. This is perhaps especially so if there is a claim for an account of profits, a remedy readily available in equity but much less so for a straight breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the present case, reference has been made to the point that the parties entered into the Confidentiality Agreement a considerable time after they had established their distributorship arrangement. Long before the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties had been cooperating in the development of the Thai market for DSM products. There was a long-standing practice (if not a requirement) for quarterly meetings at which the Plaintiff would present reports on its performance, market developments and market/customer issues. The Defendants would also from time to time participate at exhibitions in Thailand with the Plaintiff at which they would meet Thai FB&amp;N producers. It is clear that even if there was no express confidentiality agreement between the parties prior to the Confidentiality Agreement, confidential information imparted to the 1st Defendant during meetings and discussions might be covered by implied contractual obligations or equitable obligations under the well-established principles elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Coco v Clark</span>. I will go into these principles in more detail where necessary to decide an issue before the Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Customer Information constitutes confidential information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The first question before this Court is whether the Customer Information constitutes confidential information with reference to the Confidentiality Agreement and the Defendants’ common law or equitable obligations. This lies at the heart of the Plaintiff’s claim and must be addressed bearing in mind the context and background of the relationship between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relationships between the parties and Thai FB&amp;N customers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I have emphasised the point that the parties had a long commercial relationship which stretched back more than two decades prior to the termination of the distributorship arrangement in 2014. But as I noted above at [33], there is a distinct lack of documentary material on the contractual terms of the distributorship such as reporting obligations, duties imposed on the Plaintiff to develop the Thai market, duties imposed on the 1st Defendant, parties’ right of termination, and so on. The Defendants have made the point that there were occasions when Thai FB&amp;N producers would approach the 1st Defendant directly for supplies of DSM ingredients.

</div> In other words, the fact that the Defendants on occasion interacted directly with Thai FB&amp;N producers supports the Defendants’ position that they had their own direct knowledge of Thai FB&amp;N producers. Indeed, the point can fairly be made that the Defendants had a real interest in becoming familiar with the Thai market and to have interaction with Thai FB&amp;N producers. Thai FB&amp;N producers who were using or wanted to use DSM ingredients in their products were just as much the Defendants’ customers as the Plaintiff’s, and the Plaintiff was not in a position to object to this direct contact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I am satisfied that whilst the Plaintiff had the front-line position in developing the market for DSM ingredients in Thailand, the Defendants also played a real role in supporting the Plaintiff’s efforts. Whilst the Plaintiff’s position is that the 1st Defendant was not concerned with the identities of the Plaintiff’s FB&amp;N customers who required DSM ingredients, I am satisfied that the 1st Defendant (also a Thai company), in carrying out its supportive role, would become aware of the main (or at least some) Thai FB&amp;N producers who were using or might be interested in using DSM ingredients. The information and knowledge could be acquired from discussions with the Plaintiff (such as at the quarterly meetings), by attending conferences and exhibitions in Thailand, and as a result of direct approaches by some Thai FB&amp;N producers (even if infrequent). There may also have been other ways whereby the 1st Defendant legitimately accumulated information on Thai FB&amp;N producers and their needs over the years, including through presentations on DSM products by the Defendants’ staff (for example, from the business development division) to Thai FB&amp;N producers.

It stands to reason that a newly developed bespoke premix for a food product which has obtained approval from the relevant food and drug authority can be very valuable in its own right. There was no evidence put before the Court by reference to which a determination could be made as to whether the intellectual property rights (if any) in the bespoke formulations belonged to the Thai FB&amp;N customers, the 2nd Defendant, the Plaintiff or some other party, but this is not a matter that arises for decision in the case before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Key Customers List</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I will now turn to take a closer look at the documents containing the Customer Information which the Plaintiff alleges to be confidential information, starting with the Key Customers List.

The email sent by the 2nd Defendant to the Thai producer on the day after the presentation attached a copy of the presentation slides, noted the problems raised regarding service, and concluded with the response that it was DSM’s goal to delight and exceed customers’ expectations and to “increase our DSM contribution to your business.” A copy of the presentation was sent to the Plaintiff on 22 June 2013.

For example, on 6 September 2013, Dr Nont sent an email to the 1st Defendant in response to information that the Plaintiff was approximately 2% behind budget as at August 2013, and in that same e-mail, he requested advice and support to achieve the budget for “this challenging year”. That said, it seems that by the end of 2013, the Plaintiff’s sales figures had improved such that there was discussion to bring forward January 2014 orders for delivery in December 2013.

Nothing is said as to what the proprietary business information relates to, and there is no mention of customer lists, customer requirements and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Confidentiality Agreement goes on to explain that the parties are willing to disclose to each other the confidential information for the purpose of the distribution arrangement between them.

</div>
</div>
</div> I pause here to comment that the Confidentiality Agreement does not state or purport to have the effect that any information in writing and marked “Confidential” is confidential under the agreement or principles of common law and equity. The Confidentiality Agreement does not mean that <span class="font-italic">anything</span> marked “confidential” is confidential as a matter of law (whether by agreement or otherwise), only that confidential information falls under the agreement <span class="font-italic">only if</span> it is reduced to writing and marked “Confidential”. For example, if a party states in writing in a document marked “Confidential” that the formula for water is “H2O”,<span class="font-italic"> </span>this does not make the formula of water confidential as such. Indeed, cl 3 goes on to state that “[t]he receiving Party’s obligations set forth hereunder shall not extend to any Confidential Information … which at the time of disclosure is in the public domain”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Whilst cl 3 is framed as an exclusion of the Party’s obligation of confidentiality, the more fundamental objection that the information is not confidential in any case remains. It is not necessary for this Court to come to a firm landing on when the “marking” of a document as “Confidential” or “Secret” will have the effect of placing obligations on the receiving party whether under a contract or by virtue of general principles of common law and equity. Much will depend on the precise wording of the marking, any relevant contractual provision on the effect of marking, and the overall circumstances and facts. As Peter Smith J observed in <span class="font-italic">Sports Direct International</span><span class="font-italic"> Plc v Rangers International Football Club Plc</span> [2016] EWHC 85 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Sports Direct</span>”) at [25], just “because the parties label matters as being confidential does not necessarily make it so. The principles of confidentiality are more restrictive than that.” For example, whilst a contract of employment may define confidential information in broad terms, issues of restraint of trade and public policy may arise especially post-termination which affect the enforceability of such a contractual provision. There are cases holding that where the parties have specified the information to be treated as confidential and the duration and nature of the duties imposed, the court will not ordinarily impose additional or more extensive equitable obligations: see <span class="font-italic">Duncan Edward </span><span class="font-italic">Vercoe and others v Rutland Fund Management Ltd and others</span> [2010] EWHC 424 (Ch) at [329]. On the other hand, equitable obligations of confidentiality may arise in appropriate cases where the contractual obligations and definitions are less clear: see <span class="font-italic">Sports Direct </span>at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the present case, many of the documents after November 2013 such as quarterly slide presentations on “win projects” and the Key Customers List are marked with confidentiality claims in the Thai language.

</div> The markings are generally clear and visible but only start appearing on quarterly reports after the Confidentiality Agreement. The question that remains is whether the information disclosed in each report, document or presentation is, in fact and law, confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Plaintiff’s view is that the fact of a Thai FB&amp;N producer’s use of DSM ingredients sourced through the Plaintiff qualifies as confidential information. Ms Chaitharatip referred to some sample invoices issued by the Plaintiff to a Thai FB&amp;N producer for “earlier purchases of DSM Nutritional Products (with a watermark containing a confidentiality statement subsequently added by [the Plaintiff] to emphasise the confidentiality of the information contained therein)”.

</div> It is not clear, however, what Ms Chaitharatip meant when she stated that the confidentiality watermark was subsequently added. The watermark in the sample invoice appears to have been added by the Plaintiff to the invoice specifically for the purposes of the use of the invoice for the current litigation. The watermark states that “[t]he details of customers and any other information which [the Plaintiff] has submitted to the court are the trade secret of the company” and mentions the present suit between the parties.

It was not a document provided to the 1st Defendant at or around the time when the invoice was issued. Further, whilst the Plaintiff suggests that some of its FB&amp;N customers did not want the fact that they obtained DSM ingredients to be made publicly known, there is no supporting evidence for this at all.

This is primarily a question of public accessibility. Absolute novelty or secrecy is not the touchstone.

Ultimately, the question is one of fact and degree.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Information does not have to be inventive to possess the necessary quality of confidence.

In these cases, the fact that the individual features or elements are already known does not mean that the end result does not possess the necessary quality of confidence. It may be a case where the end result is more than just the sum of the parts. Nevertheless, in these instances, the plea that the individual elements have been combined together in a way so as to produce something which is new in itself, is a plea that requires careful analysis and must be supported by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) To succeed, the claimant will have to show that the information alleged to be confidential is sufficiently well developed … Factors relevant to whether the information is sufficiently well developed include: whether the information (if said to embody a new idea) is realisable in actuality and whether it has been developed to the point where it acquires some commercial attractiveness. Ultimately, it is suggested that what is needed is for the claimant to show that the information has been developed to the point where it can be defined with sufficient objective certainty such that the defendant can understand the case being put to him …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the present case, there is little doubt that the information disclosed on the formulation of standard as well as bespoke premixes can easily be found to possess the necessary quality of confidence by reference to the principles summarised above. Indeed, there may well have been other items of information that had been disclosed between the parties on specific issues such as solutions to quality or manufacturing issues that possess the necessary quality of confidence. New marketing plans, details on emerging food fads or strategies for future business development might also qualify as confidential information in the appropriate circumstances. It is not, however, necessary for this court to come to a firm landing on these points; the heart of the dispute concerns the information on the Customer Information such as the identities of the Plaintiff’s key customers that was supplied to the 1st Defendant by way of the Key Customers List.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It may well be that the 1st Defendant would have been able to derive its own version of the Key Customers List with the aid of independent third-party FB&amp;N market researchers, Internet resources as well as the 1st Defendant’s own internal records built up over the history of their relationship with the Plaintiff. Indeed, the 1st Defendant suggested that many of the Plaintiff’s competitors (suppliers of ingredients to FB&amp;N producers) in Thailand would have their own lists of FB&amp;N producers including information on ingredients used. Mr Redman, however, quite properly accepted that whilst the 1st Defendant’s list of key customers might be similar, the lists would not be identical.

Given the long history of the commercial relationship between the parties it is unsurprising how difficult it is to determine the provenance of all the information in the Defendants’ possession. The fact that some records including those relating to minutes of quarterly meetings between the 1st Defendant and Plaintiff in earlier years were misplaced or lost by both the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff heightens the problem. The difficulties which the 1st Defendant asserts it encountered in locating more records to bolster its claim that Thai FB&amp;N producers had sometimes contacted or placed orders directly with the 1st Defendant (because of lapse of time and the digitisation of records)

These include reports on developing market trends and new products in Thailand. Indeed, whilst the matter was not examined in any detail, it appears likely that bespoke reports could be commissioned. Indeed, the point was made that the Plaintiff had even asked the 1st Defendant for a copy of a Mintel market trend report for 2014 that the 1st Defendant had acquired.

I am satisfied that even if the 1st Defendant had been able to construct its own list of key FB&amp;N producers in Thailand who were using DSM ingredients, there is no doubting the time and effort that would have been required. It is also unlikely that any list produced by the 1st Defendant simply from its internal records (such as purchase orders and quarterly reports) would be as comprehensive as the Key Customers List.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In <span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd and another v Brakes Bros Ltd and others</span> [2014] EWHC 3495 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions</span>”), two associated claimant companies brought claims in respect of the defendants’ misuse of their group’s confidential information. The claimants carried on business of providing employee benefit packages to other companies. The first defendant was a company that contracted with the claimants to provide insurance for its employees. It subsequently provided to the other defendants the list of all of its employees who had policies with the claimants, together with those employees’ gross premiums.

The list was not widely available and included “refined information” which showed who was willing to take insurance and at what price. Whilst the 1st Defendant would have been able to construct a similar list by asking each employee for the information, this would have taken time and depended on the cooperation of each employee. In these circumstances, the English High Court found that the information amounted to commercial intelligence which was of value to competitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 <span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions</span> subsequently proceeded to the assessment of damages hearing, and an issue arising over the scope of the assessment of damages resulted in an appeal to a differently-constituted High Court in <span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd and another vs Brakes Bros Ltd and others</span> [2017] EWHC 383 (QB).

In his answer to a question from the Court on confidentiality and the Key Customers List, Mr Redman’s response was that whilst the information was available from outside sources, such information was “fragmented” and that “it would take [a] long time … to get that information together.”

</div> This concession was fairly made by the witness. For example, it does not appear that the 1st Defendant would have been able to determine who the Plaintiff’s FB&amp;N customers were simply by looking at purchase orders which simply indicated the quantity of ingredients and did not reveal the identity of the FB&amp;N producers unless the order was unusual in some respect (such as quantity).

This point must be borne in mind when considering the later question of breach or unauthorised use. Where, for example, the defendant is only shown to have misused part of the information, it will ordinarily be necessary to show that the misuse relates to a “material part” of the information: see Tanya Aplin <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Gurry on Breach of Confidence</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012) at paras 15.10–15.13.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>This point is considered in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I note as well that this part of my reasoning regarding the confidentiality of the Key Customers List does not extend to the other documents, correspondence and information received by the Defendants. The rest of the Customer Information was generally accumulated over the years in a piecemeal fashion and was not collated in the same way as the Key Customers List was. However, Mr Redman accepted that information in the Ongoing Projects List and the reports on new products provided in April 2014 contained useful information for securing orders from new FB&amp;N producers and persuading existing FB&amp;N customers to extend their orders to other DSM ingredients,

The Plaintiff’s position is that the Defendants should have found the existing customers of DSM FB&amp;N products through their own effort and without use of confidential information provided by the Plaintiff over the years, and in particular, as set out in the Key Customers List.

</div> This answer was given in response to a question directed at whether the Key Customers List could be used for any purpose other than assisting the Plaintiff with developing its market share. Mr Redman’s response that it would not be right to simply give the list to Rama should be read in this context. To put the point in a different way: the question of whether<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>handing over the Key Customers List to a competitor of the Plaintiff for purposes unconnected with the Defendants’ need to engage and appoint a new distributor constitutes unauthorised use, is quite different from the question of whether handing over the list (or using the information) for the purpose of effecting a transition to a new distributor is an unauthorised use. This is especially if the only use made of the Key Customers List was to reference the names of the Thai FB&amp;N customers for DSM products and nothing more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Looking at the evidence as a whole, I find that the 1st Defendant only used the information in the Key Customers List so as to identify the Thai FB&amp;N producers who were key customers of DSM products and to send them the Notice. The evidence does not establish what (if any) further use was made of the Key Customers List by the Defendants, including whether a copy was passed to Rama or used by Rama to facilitate implementation of the new distributorship arrangements. Once the recipients of the Notice became aware of the change of distributorship, they would have had to obtain DSM products directly from the Defendants or from Rama if they desired them. Thereafter, it was unlikely that the 1st Defendant would have had any difficulties ascertaining the needs of the respective FB&amp;N producers for DSM ingredients. If a FB&amp;N producer wished to continue using DSM ingredients for its products, it would have provided information as to its requirements directly to the 1st Defendant or Rama. I note as well that Rama’s appointment was short-lived and terminated after just several months.

</div>
</div> It is of course not surprising at all that Thai FB&amp;N producers who wanted to use DSM ingredients in their products decided to deal directly with the Defendants, Rama or whomever was appointed as the new distributor for DSM products in Thailand. With the termination of the distributorship arrangement (transitional arrangements aside), the Plaintiff would no longer be able to supply DSM products to its FB&amp;N customers in the same way. The Plaintiff’s “loss” of all of its customers for DSM products was the inevitable consequence of the loss of its distributorship rights, and it bears repeating that it is not the Plaintiff’s case in the present action that the Defendants were prohibited from selling their products in Thailand or appointing a new distributor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101  In deciding whether the use made of the information in the Key Customers List was unauthorised, I reiterate the following points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff and Defendants had a long-standing relationship and shared interest in the Thai FB&amp;N market. Whilst the Plaintiff had invested much time, effort and financial resources in developing the market for DSM products, there is no doubt that the Defendants supported the Plaintiff’s efforts. The products being marketed by the Plaintiff were DSM products and were not marketed (in the sense of being branded) as the Plaintiff’s products.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Key Customers List was originally requested by the 1st Defendant for “reference purposes”, albeit in connection with assisting the Plaintiff develop the Thai market for DSM products. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There were no express terms on the termination of the distributorship arrangement, such as terms on the notice period, transitional arrangements for stock in trade, and so on. The Plaintiff could well have contracted for obligations to supply DSM ingredients to some of its key customers beyond the 10 July 2014 termination date. The 1st Defendant had proposed transitional provisions to the effect that where the Plaintiff had long-term binding supply commitments, the 1st Defendant would continue to supply products to the Plaintiff for up to two months. Other transitional arrangements proposed by the 1st Defendant included matters relating to the transfer and delivery up of authorisations/licences to import DSM products; the return of samples, sales promotion literature, training materials; and the sale-back of stocks already acquired by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The Plaintiff’s case is that the use of the Key Customers List for the purpose of notifying key customers of the impending termination of the distributorship arrangement went outside the purpose for which it was provided and is accordingly unauthorised. The difficulty with this is that the question of whether the use is unauthorised must be considered in light of the circumstances as a whole, including the relationships between the parties and their respective interests in the Thai market for DSM products. It stands to reason that where the parties have had a long manufacturer-distributorship relationship, the manufacturer would have a legitimate interest<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>in wanting to inform the market and its customers of the change of distributorship. For example, if the Defendants had simply taken out a series of newspaper advertisements in Thailand announcing the termination of the distributorship and setting out information on new sources of supply for DSM products, the Plaintiff on the case as presented would have no reason for any complaint at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the present case, the 1st Defendant informed the key customers of DSM products by way of the Notice. Whilst I accept the 1st Defendant was able to do this because of the Key Customers List, in my judgment, the use of the Key Customers List for this purpose was not unauthorised. Looking at the manufacturer-distributor relationship between the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant for DSM products in Thailand, I am satisfied that the 1st Defendant was implicitly authorised to use its knowledge of the key customers so as to inform them of the termination of the distributorship. The Key Customers List provided by the Plaintiff was not a general list of FB&amp;N producers in Thailand or a list of all the FB&amp;N producers which the Plaintiff had dealings with. It was a list of FB&amp;N producers who were supplied with DSM products by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In reaching this conclusion, I note the point expressed in <span class="font-italic">Gurry on Breach of Confidence</span> at para 15.05<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>that the question is whether a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the recipient would understand that the use made was not permitted. This depends on the facts and circumstances as a whole, including whether there was a limited purpose behind the disclosure. The weight to be attached to that limited purpose must of course depend on all the facts. Cases such as <span class="font-italic">R v Department of Health </span><span class="font-italic">Ex Parte Source Informatics</span> [2001] QB 424 at [31] tend to the view (at least where the action is in equity) that a touchstone of liability and misuse is whether the defendant’s conscience should be troubled: see R G Toulson &amp; C M Phipps, <span class="font-italic">Confidentiality </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2012) at para 3-173 which further states that there may be circumstances in which the confidant has a real need to use the confidential information, such as where the disclosure or use is fairly required for the protection of the party’s legitimate interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The decision of the English Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> Person</span><span class="font-italic">nel Hygiene Services Ltd and another v Rentokil Initial UK Ltd (t/a Initial Medical Services) and another</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 29 (“<span class="font-italic">Person</span><span class="font-italic">nel Hygiene Services</span>”) provides a helpful contrast. In this case, the claimant was in the business of providing clinical waste bins for hazardous waste material which involved collecting the waste bins and replacing them at regular intervals as well as disposal of the waste. To this end, rental agreements were entered into with the claimant’s customers. Servicing of the bins was done by sub-contractors. During negotiations over the appointment of the defendant in 2007 as sub-contractors, the claimant and defendant agreed to exchange information on their businesses under a confidentiality agreement, and the defendant was subsequently appointed as a sub-contractor. In 2012, the claimant gave notice of termination. The defendant accessed information of the claimant’s customers (names, addresses, contact numbers, service requirements, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) to contact the customers and make untrue and misleading statements about the claimant: at [7]–[16].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 On these facts, it is not surprising that the court in <span class="font-italic">Person</span><span class="font-italic">nel Hygiene Services</span> found that the customer information was confidential and that the duty of confidentiality continued during and after the sub-contract had come to an end: see [20] and [47]. Even though the express confidentiality obligation was for the purposes of covering the negotiations and the parties’ evaluation of each other’s businesses, the court found that the reasonable man would have regarded it clear that the information provided in relation to existing customers was intended to remain confidential under the sub-contract: at [25]. A non-user injunction was granted as there was a real risk that the defendant would re-launch its campaign targeting the claimant’s customers: at [52]. The non-user injunction did not amount to an unjustified restraint on competition as it did not have the effect of preventing the defendant from approaching the customers, provided it did not use any confidential information when making the approach. The injunction was limited to a specified period which was based on the court’s estimate of the latest date by which the defendant could have been expected to discover the identity of the claimant’s customers through publicly available sources: see [27] and [28].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 <span class="font-italic">Personnel Hygiene Services </span>can be distinguished from the present case. The defendant in <span class="font-italic">Person</span><span class="font-italic">nel Hygiene Services</span> was essentially using the customer information to contact the claimant’s customers in an effort to divert the servicing of the claimant’s waste bins back to itself. There was also nothing to suggest that the defendant had worked with the claimant to develop and expand the claimant’s business of supplying waste bins.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Defendants in the present case rightly submit that the Thai FB&amp;N producers had been purchasing products from the Plaintiff because they wanted to use DSM products to manufacture their FB&amp;N products.

</div>
</div> If the Plaintiff was not the local distributor, it would not have been in the position of conducting any business in respect of DSM products with those Thai FB&amp;N producers in the first place. It follows that after termination of the distribution arrangement, the Plaintiff did not have any legitimate interest in stopping the 1st Defendant from informing the FB&amp;N producers of the change of distributorship and where they should go if they wished to continue to use DSM products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I pause to note that the Plaintiff’s submissions referred the Court to several foreign decisions where liability arose in connection with the copying and/or unauthorised use of customer information. These include <span class="font-italic">Robb v Green</span> [1895] 2 QB 1; <span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions</span>; and<span class="font-italic"> DC Payments Pty Ltd v Next Payments Pty Ltd</span> [2016] VSC 315 (“<span class="font-italic">DC Payments</span>”). This Court does not doubt (and has indeed found) that customer lists can and have been held to constitute confidential information. Indeed, there are Singapore cases such as <span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy v Certact Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 835 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy</span>”) in which customer lists or customer information were found to be confidential on the facts, but these cases do not assist the Plaintiff for the reasons briefly set out below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Robb v Green</span>, the English High Court found that the names of the employer’s customers (over the length and breadth of Great Britain) and set out in an order-book was confidential information. The defendant employee was held liable for copying the list of names while he was still an employee, with the intent of using the list to compete with the employer post-employment. The defendant, by making the copy, was already acting in breach of his duty of fidelity to his employer even if he had not yet started to use the list to compete with his employer. He had no right to copy his employer’s list of customers for the purpose of competing with him at a time when he was still an employee. But this is clearly a rather different case as compared to the present one. The Defendants had a shared interest in developing the Thai market for DSM products together with the Plaintiff. The recipients of the Notice were customers for the DSM products which the Defendants had a legitimate interest in. By using the Key Customers List to obtain the names of those customers for the purpose of informing them of the change of distributorship, the 1st Defendant could not be said to have made an unauthorised use of the names such as to constitute misuse of the confidential information encapsulated in the Key Customers List.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The facts and issues in <span class="font-italic">Personal Management Solutions </span>can be distinguished as well. The English High Court found that the information in the list had been misused as a result of the first defendant sending a copy to the other defendants, and because of the use of the information in discussions on alternative insurance packages and premiums. The “interest” of the first defendant was in essence nothing more than the fact that the insured persons were its employees. In the present case, the Defendants’ interest arises from the fact they are the “owners” of the DSM ingredient products. The Defendants have the right to decide who they wish to appoint as their distributor and on what terms. Once a distributorship was terminated, the Thai FB&amp;N producers who wished to continue using DSM ingredients would naturally need to either contact the Defendants directly or their new distributor. The Plaintiff would not be able to offer those Thai FB&amp;N producers DSM products after the termination of the distributorship arrangement and the expiration of any transitional arrangements. The Plaintiff could not compete with the Defendants for the supply of <span class="font-italic">DSM</span> products in the Thai FB&amp;N market; it could only find alternative manufacturers of FB&amp;N ingredients and persuade customers to switch from DSM products to alternative products distributed by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Similarly, the other cases cited by the Plaintiff such as <span class="font-italic">DC Payments</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tang Siew Choy</span> are distinguishable from the present facts. Those cases involved situations where the respective plaintiffs’ confidential customer information was sent – either inadvertently or wilfully by former employees – to the defendants, who were each competitors of the respective plaintiffs and made use of the customer information for a business advantage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Each case must depend on its own facts and circumstances. In the present case, it is clear that the Defendants had a legitimate and longstanding concern with developing the Thai market which included helping the Plaintiff develop its penetration of the market for DSM products. The Defendants, over many years of engagement with the Plaintiff as the distributor of DSM products, naturally had a legitimate reason for wanting and needing to inform those Thai FB&amp;N producers of the change of distributor. It would also not be reasonable to expect the 1st Defendant to have deliberately ignored the Key Customers List that it already had on hand, and to have instead proceeded to spend time and resources figuring out the identities of the customers to whom they would send the Notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111  Whilst this Court accepts that the Key Customers List amounts to confidential information as a whole, the use established by the evidence was nothing more than use of the names of the FB&amp;N customers for DSM products for the purpose of notifying them of the change in distributor. There is no evidence showing that the Defendants revealed or used information as to what prices the Plaintiff may have charged those customers (the mark-up) for DSM products. Indeed, there is no information in the Key Customers List on the Plaintiff’s mark-up and prices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I note also that this was not the first time that the 1st Defendant had reached out to the Plaintiff’s customers for DSM products. The evidence establishes that the Plaintiff in earlier years was also the 1st Defendant’s appointed local distributor for DSM “personal care products”. In October 2010, the 1st Defendant notified the Plaintiff of its decision to appoint a new local distributor for these DSM products effective from 1 January 2011. The Plaintiff was requested to transfer back all related documents so that a “smooth transition” could be arranged for customers who needed a continued supply. This was followed by a notice sent on 1 January 2011 to Thai retailers and businesses who had purchased DSM personal care products. This notice was also addressed to “Dear Valued Customer” and set out information on the new distributor and the relevant contact persons.

</div> There is nothing to suggest that the Plaintiff took any issue at the time of this change of distributorship with the 1st Defendant sending the notice to its customers for DSM personal care products. It does not appear that any complaint was made, or that any legal action was instituted for misuse of confidential information.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Plaintiff’s general position is that the Defendants had acted “unfairly” in terminating the Distributorship arrangement on short notice, and it makes reference to the effort expended over many years in developing the market in Thailand for DSM products and the history of its performance. The Defendants, in the notice to the Thai FB&amp;N customers, accepted that the Plaintiff had been a good partner and that the change of distributorship was because of a change in company directions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Whilst the decision of Tan Lee Meng J in <span class="font-italic">Citrus World Inc v Neotrade Marketing Pte Ltd</span> [2000] SGHC 283 is not on all fours with the present facts, his general observation at [45] bears setting out:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[w]hatever expectations the defendants may have had in the past about their long-term relationship with the plaintiffs, it is common ground that … the defendants were appointed as distributors for only one year. As such, unless the agreement had been renewed, the plaintiffs were entitled to appoint a new distributor in place of the defendants. Whether or not the plaintiffs had been fair … is not relevant to the plaintiffs[’] right to appoint a new distributor …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Likewise, in the present case, the question as to whether the Defendants had acted fairly in deciding to change distributors is beside the point. This action is not for wrongful termination of the distributorship. Whilst the Plaintiff may assert that a one-month notice together with a further two-month transitional period for orders and long-standing customers of the Plaintiff was too short, it is clear that they do not (and indeed cannot) take the position that the distributorship arrangement could not be terminated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings and conclusions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 For clarity, I now set out a summary of the key findings of facts and conclusions that have been addressed in the preceding paragraphs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The key findings of fact relevant to the issues as pleaded and presented to the Court are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The distributorship arrangement between the parties that was acknowledged in a letter dated 31 July 2005 was not an exclusive distributorship. Under the distributorship arrangement, the 1st Defendant determined which DSM products the Plaintiff had rights to sell as the local distributor in Thailand. Whilst the Plaintiff had rights to sell a broad range of DSM FB&amp;N ingredients, there were some which were assigned to other distributors. The Defendants could and did re-allocate DSM products to different distributors from time to time. Orders placed by the Plaintiff for DSM products were subject to the 1st Defendant’s standard terms and conditions. There were no express terms on the termination of the distributorship arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Throughout the history of the relationship between the parties, there were regular meetings during which quarterly reports were presented and discussions held regarding matters such as the Plaintiff’s performance, problems that had been encountered, developments in the Thai market and new products or entrants into the Thai FB&amp;N market. The 1st Defendant set annual performance targets for the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whilst the Plaintiff was the local distributor and had incurred considerable expenses and put in sustained effort over the years to develop its business and the market for DSM products in Thailand, the Defendants also committed time and resources to work with the Plaintiff towards this end. Apart from its involvement in discussions on market developments including problems with supply and costs, the Defendants also participated at some FB&amp;N product exhibitions and made presentations to specific Thai FB&amp;N producers. The Defendants had a legitimate and sustained interest in monitoring (both in general terms and specifically in respect of the Plaintiff’s performance), understanding and interacting with the Thai market.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The 1st Defendant acquired a good deal of knowledge on the Thai market including the identities of the main Thai FB&amp;N producers who were customers for DSM ingredients. This information was acquired over a period of time from a variety of sources, including: (a) quarterly reports; (b) quarterly meetings and discussions with the Plaintiff; (c) attendance at FB&amp;N ingredient exhibitions in Thailand; (d) meetings/presentations with FB&amp;N producers; (e) meetings with FB&amp;N producers and requests for bespoke premixes; and (f) market intelligence reports.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Prior to the parties entering into the Confidentiality Agreement, at or around end-October 2013, the parties did not have a written confidentiality agreement. Exchanges of information at quarterly meetings and reports provided by the Plaintiff were not marked as confidential.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) At the time that the Key Customers List was prepared and handed to the 1st Defendant, the Confidentiality Agreement was operative and in force. The Key Customers List bore a confidentiality mark when it was sent to the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The Key Customers List set out the names of 42 key customers, and the types, applications and quantities of products they ordered per quarter. The Key Customers List did not set out the addresses or contact details of the customers, or the names of contact persons. The Key Customers List (as well as the Ongoing Projects List) does not set out any information on the prices or mark-ups charged by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Whilst the 1st Defendant (together with the 2nd Defendant) would have been able to construct a list of the Plaintiff’s customers for DSM products in Thailand through the sources of information set out in (d) above, time and effort would have been required to do this. There were many other Thai distributors of FB&amp;N ingredients such as Rama, with their own lists of key customers of FB&amp;N ingredients, and whilst there may have been overlaps between the lists, the lists of key customers for the different distributors were unlikely to be the same.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The 1st Defendant may have used the names of the customers in the Key Customers List to identify the Thai producers to whom the notice of change of distributorship was to be sent to, but the information on the contact persons and addresses (or e-mail addresses) was likely to have been taken from other sources including the records of the 1st Defendant and Rama. Whilst there was no evidence on this point, I note that trade directories and the Internet are also possible sources for detailed addressing information. There is no evidence suggesting that the 1st Defendant used any other information in the Key Customers List, such as the estimated quantities of products ordered by each customer. Whilst it was intended for Rama to replace the Plaintiff as the local distributor of DSM ingredients, Rama’s appointment was short-lived and terminated after several months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 On the basis of the factual findings as summarised above, the conclusions I have arrived at in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim for unauthorised use of confidential information can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The mere fact that there was no written agreement or express term of confidentiality imposed under the distributorship arrangement does not mean that no implied term of confidentiality or equitable obligations of confidentiality existed. Whether any information provided was confidential and caught by an implied or equitable duty of confidentiality depends on the facts and the general principles on the law of confidence as summarised earlier.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whilst many of the component items of information in the Key Customers List were available from public sources or from the 1st Defendant’s own sources, the information contained therein as a whole was not readily available to the public. The Key Customers List as a whole contained useful information of some commercial value. The 1st Defendant may have been able to produce a similar list, but this would have taken some time bearing in mind that the list was not just a simple list of the names of the FB&amp;N customers. On balance, I accept that the Key Customers List was a product of work, time and effort sufficient to make the list confidential as a whole, even though some or many of the component parts were in the public domain.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Given the above factors, as well as the fact that the Key Customers List bore a confidentiality mark (which, while not dispositive, is an indication of the parties’ intention to treat the information as confidential), I find that the Key Customers List constituted confidential information that was covered by the Confidentiality Agreement and relevant principles of equity. To use the language of equity, the Key Customers List as a whole possessed the necessary quality of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The question as to whether the Defendants made an unauthorised <span class="font-italic">use </span>of the confidential information requires that the Court bear in mind the nature, scope and reason why the Key Customers List is confidential. This is important since the only information used from the Key Customers List (or, for that matter, any other documents containing Customer Information) in sending out the Notice was the names of the customers. Where information is confidential only because of its collocation or compilation as a whole, it stands to reason that misuse only occurs if the defendant is shown to have used that collocation or compilation as a whole. Further, even if the Defendant is shown to have made use of a relevant part of the confidential information, it must still be shown that the use was unauthorised.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Any use of the Key Customers List made by the Plaintiff was not <span class="font-italic">unauthorised</span>. Under the Confidentiality Agreement, confidential information provided was to be used only for the purposes of “the distribution arrangement”. In my view, the use of the customer names for the purposes of notifying them of the change of distributorship is in connection with and falls within the purposes of the said distribution arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) It follows that the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants for unauthorised use of confidential information in respect of the Notice fails.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Although it is not necessary for me to decide, I nonetheless express the view that there is no basis for finding the 2nd Defendant liable for any misuse of confidential information by the 1st Defendant. The Notice was sent out by the 1st Defendant and not by the 2nd Defendant. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the Key Customers List was handed to the 2nd Defendant, or if that had taken place, whether the 2nd Defendant had any role in the use of the Key Customers List or other Customer Information to send out the Notice. I acknowledge the fact the 1st Defendant is under the corporate control of the 2nd Defendant, as well as the role played by DSM Group’s corporate legal counsel in the termination of the distributorship,

</div>
</div> but this is not sufficient in my opinion. The main point, of course, is that the 1st Defendant’s use of the Key Customers List did not in any event amount to an unauthorised use.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118  This is a case where the parties enjoyed a long commercial relationship, during which they shared the common interest and goal of supplying DSM ingredients in the Thai FB&amp;N market. The more FB&amp;N customers the Plaintiff was able to obtain orders from for DSM ingredients, the more orders it was able to place in turn with the 1st Defendant. Developing the market depended on a host of factors including: (i) the reputation and quality of DSM products; (ii) the marketing efforts of the Plaintiff; (iii) the reliability of the supply chain (deliveries, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>); (iv) the cost and price of DSM ingredients; and (v) the general support of the Defendants in the marketing efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The core finding of this Court is that whilst the Key Customers List constituted or contained confidential information, the Plaintiff’s claim fails on the ground that the Defendants did not make any <span class="font-italic">unauthorised</span> use of the confidential information. Given the nature of the distributorship arrangement and the dealings between the parties, the Plaintiff must have contemplated and understood that upon termination, the 1st Defendant would have a genuine need to inform Thai FB&amp;N customers of DSM ingredients of the change in distributorship by way of the Notice. There is insufficient basis to find that the Defendants used any other confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 For these reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s action. I also order that the costs of the proceedings be agreed or taxed, and paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Finally, whilst this case was fought hard, I take this opportunity to record the Court’s gratitude to learned counsel for the overall manner of conduct of the trial and for their helpful submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lin Weiqi Wendy, Liu Zhao Xiang and Mehaerun Simaa (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Ramesh Kumar s/o Ramasamy and Tseng Zhi Cheng, Sean Douglas (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
