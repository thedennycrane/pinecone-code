        Chan Seng Onn J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a dispute concerning the recovery of a
                    house without a land title by the landowner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Sometime in 1959, Ng Chwee Kim was permitted to
                    erect a single storey terrace house known as No 24 Meng Suan Road Singapore
                    779225 (the “house”) on part of a piece of land of 1957.1 sq m
                    with a 999 years leasehold tenure known as Lot 550P of Mukim 13 (the
                    “land”). The plaintiff, Ong Beng Chong, is presently the
                    registered proprietor of the land. The house is one of the units in a row of 9
                    terrace houses (Nos 20 to 28 Meng Suan Road Singapore) built on the
                land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By way of a deed of assignment dated
                    16 March 1983, the defendant, Goh Kim Thong, and his wife Lee Kui Want
                    (assignees) bought the 24 year old house (without the land) for a mere $10,000
                    from the then ground tenants of the land, Koh Kar Gat and Lee Yong Pow
                    (assignors). The assignment itself stated that the house had been erected on the
                    land owned by the plaintiff (and some predecessors in title of the plaintiff).
                    The defendant continued with the payment of ground rent to the plaintiff as the
                    landlord. The defendant recognised that the plaintiff is the owner of the land
                    on which the defendant’s house sits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant argued that he had not been in
                    arrears in paying the ground rent (and any arrears was in fact due to the
                    plaintiff’s refusal to accept his payment) and that he had not breached
                    the agreement dated 25 July 1959 whereby (a) Lian Aik Building &amp;
                    Company was authorised by Ng Chwee Kim to construct the house on the land at the
                    agreed price of $6,500; and (b) it was agreed that the “land rental of
                    seven dollars per month is to be directly collected by the landlord from the
                    owner of the house”. Based on this agreement, the defendant contended
                    that so long as he paid the ground rent of $7 per month, he was entitled to
                    squat on the land until the 999 years lease runs out in the year
                2883.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Notice to Quit </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 October 2009, the plaintiff served a
                    Notice to Quit on the defendant, giving him a month’s notice. The
                    plaintiff regarded the defendant as a month to month tenant paying a monthly
                    ground rent to him. On 30 November 2009, the plaintiff determined the
                    defendant’s ground tenancy and required the defendant to deliver up vacant
                    possession of the house. The defendant refused the offer of compensation of
                    $225,000 from the plaintiff and demanded instead $1.8 million to $2 million
                    dollars before he would vacate the house. As the plaintiff considered the sum
                    demanded to be unreasonable, the plaintiff took up this originating summons
                    requiring the defendant to deliver up vacant possession and pay the outstanding
                    monthly ground rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The legal position with respect to recovery of
                    possession in such cases is clear. In <em>Khew Ah Bah v Hong Ah
                        Mye</em> [1971-1973] SLR(R) 107, the defendant purchased an
                    attap house in 1934, which was built with the permission of the owner of the
                    land. The defendant had ever since been paying $3 per month as ground rent to
                    the landowner. In 1963, the landowner sold the property to the plaintiff who
                    acquired it subject to the existing rights of the defendant. In 1968, the
                    plaintiff landowner served a notice to quit on the defendant, contending
                        <em>inter alia</em> that the tenancy at the rental of
                    $3 per month had been determined and that he was not precluded from recovering
                    possession of the premises. Choor Singh J allowed the landowner’s claim
                    holding, <em>inter alia</em>, that the defendant had
                    certain rights in equity which the landowner must satisfy before he could
                    recover possession. He held that it was plain from the authorities that if the
                    owner of land allowed another to expend money on the land under an expectation
                    created or encouraged by the landowner that he would be able to remain there,
                    that raised an equity in the licensee such as to enable him to stay there. The
                    case of a tenant paying ground rent for the use of the land on which he has been
                    allowed to erect a dwelling house is even stronger. He has a tenancy coupled
                    with an equity. In such a case the landlord cannot recover possession of his
                    land by merely terminating the tenancy; he must also satisfy the equity. The
                    fundamental question in the case was how this equity was to be satisfied. Choor
                    Singh J came to the conclusion that the person who built the house must have
                    been led to believe that he would be allowed to remain on the land so long as he
                    continued paying the ground rent of $3 per month for otherwise he could not have
                    built his house on land which did not belong to him. For 34 years from 1934 to
                    1968, none of the defendant’s successive landlords took any step to
                    determine the tenancy. All successive owners of the land including the plaintiff
                    purchased it with notice of the defendant’s rights in respect of the land
                    and they continued to receive from him $3 per month as ground rent. After much
                    consideration, Choor Singh J concluded that the plaintiff should be allowed to
                    recover possession of the premises on condition that he made <em>reasonable compensation</em> to the defendant for what was, in the
                    words of Taylor J in <em>Kwek Kim Hock v Ong Boon
                        Siong</em> [1954] 1 MLJ 253 “tantamount to
                    expropriation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Court of Appeal in <em>Lee
                        Suat Hong v Teo Lye</em> [1987] SLR(R) 70 had occasion to
                    deal with a similar case. The defendant/respondent claimed to be entitled to
                    continued possession of the premises on the ground that the plaintiff/appellant
                    was estopped from denying the defendant’s right to remain in occupation of
                    the premises known as No 38A, Lorong Puntong, Singapore for as long as the
                    defendant and her family deemed fit. The Court of Appeal set out its views at
                    [13]-[23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    In our view, in
                            cases such as this where the defendant raises equitable estoppel to
                            restrict the plaintiff from exercising his legal rights as landowner,
                            the proper approach is to inquire first, whether any equitable estoppel
                            exists, and if so, the extent of the equity established by the estoppel,
                            before next considering how best that equity may be
                        satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    Whether there is an
                            equity and its extent will, in the normal case, depend simply on the
                            initial conduct said to give rise to the equity, although the court may
                            have to decide how having regard to supervening circumstances, the
                            equity can best be satisfied. If the equity so requires, the court may
                            declare the defendant to be entitled to possession until his outlay is
                            repaid, or even for so long as he
                            wishes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    With regard to the
                            creation of the estoppel, the general principle is that an estoppel
                            arises where one party (A) makes a representation or promise to another
                            party (B) intending (B) to act in reliance on the representation or
                            promise, and (B) does so act to his detriment. (A) will then be estopped
                            from acting inconsistently with his representation or
                        promise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    In this particular case,
                            the uncontrovertible facts show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    prior to moving to the present premises (38A),
                                the defendant and her family were staying at Lot 234 which belonged
                                to the defendant's elder sister, one Soh Thow Neo;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the house at 38A was built by the defendant's
                                late husband with the permission of the then owner of the land;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the defendant and her family had been residing
                                at 38A from 1956 or thereabouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17     However, the crucial fact in dispute was
                        the nature of the representation or promise made to the defendant and her
                        family which encouraged or induced them to move to 38A and expend money in
                        building a house on land which did not belong to them and thereafter to stay
                        on the premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    We would therefore restore the trial judge's
                            finding that no expectation that the defendant be permitted to stay at
                            38A permanently had been created. This does not, however, mean that the
                            plaintiff should be entitled to an order for possession without more. At
                            the very least, and this the plaintiff does not dispute, the defendant
                            having expended money in building her house on the premises with the
                            then owner's consent, there is an equitable estoppel or an estoppel by
                            acquiescence operating in favour of the defendant, thereby creating in
                            her favour an equity which has to be satisfied before the plaintiff can
                            recover possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    On the basis of the trial judge's finding, this
                            equity obviously cannot extend to protecting the defendant's occupation
                            of 38A permanently. Neither would it therefore require that the
                            defendant should be compensated with the costs of finding alternative
                            accommodation in order that the equity may be satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    On the evidence, the extent of the defendant's
                            equity was merely to protect her from eviction without being compensated
                            for the money expended in erecting the house. The defendant's equity can
                            therefore be satisfied if she were so compensated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    As it was common ground that the replacement cost
                            of the house has been valued at $24,207, we therefore restored the trial
                            judge's order that the plaintiff be entitled to possession of the
                            premises upon payment of $24,207 to the defendant. We further ordered
                            that the defendant vacate the premises by 31 May
                        1987.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the facts of this case, apart from the fact
                    that the original owner of the house, Ng Chwee Kim, was permitted to erect the
                    house on part of the land, I found no evidence of representations of any kind
                    being made by the plaintiff or his predecessors in title to the previous owners
                    of the house or the defendant that the owner of the house would be entitled to
                    stay permanently on the premises. As such, no expectation had been created that
                    the defendant was permitted to stay permanently at the premises. Accordingly,
                    the defendant had to vacate the house and surrender the premises. I did not
                    allow him to continue to pay the ground rent and stay till the expiry of the 999
                    years lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       However, as the original owner of the house was
                    permitted by the then landowner to erect a house on part of the land which led
                    the original house owner to expend money in building the house on the land, the
                    authorities are clear that an equity in favour of the house owner (and his
                    successors in title) has been created which must be satisfied before the
                    landowner (or his successors in title) can recover possession. As this case is
                    similar to the facts in <em>Lee Suat Hong v Teo Lye</em>, I
                    was of the view that the equity would be amply satisfied by the plaintiff paying
                    reasonable compensation to the defendant for the replacement cost of the house
                    adjusted for depreciation to take account of the present age and condition of
                    the house. I did not consider it to be reasonable that the compensation be based
                    on the cost of building a new house of a similar size without allowing for any
                    depreciation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First Hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     During the first hearing on 23 March 2010, I
                    had stood down the matter for the defendant to consider the compensation offer
                    by the plaintiff and to reach an amicable settlement if possible. When this did
                    not materialise, I informed the defendant that I might have to order a valuation
                    of the house to assist me in objectively assessing what would be a reasonable
                    amount of compensation but there was a risk that the valuation by professional
                    valuers might well fall below the plaintiff’s offer of $225,000. The
                    defendant said he wanted the valuation done. It was a gamble that the defendant
                    took.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Accordingly, I made the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“1.    The defendant shall deliver up vacant
                            possession of No 24 Meng Suan Road Singapore 779225 (“the said
                            House”) to the plaintiff in exchange for payment of reasonable
                            compensation to be determined by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Each party shall engage its own professional
                            valuers to produce a valuation report on the replacement cost of
                            constructing a house based on the same materials as with the said House
                            with depreciation accounted for the age of the said House.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The defendant shall grant access to the
                            professional valuers appointed by the plaintiff and the defendant to
                            carry out the valuation by 3.4.2010 and the aforesaid valuation reports
                            to be submitted to the Court by 17.4.2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Further hearing of the case shall be fixed not
                            earlier than 17.4.2010.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second Hearing </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The second hearing was fixed on 17 May
                    2010 after the parties had obtained the valuations as ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff engaged Jones Lang LaSalle.
                    Using the Depreciated Replacement Cost Method and assuming a building lifespan
                    of 65 years, Jones Lang LaSalle valued the house at $67,000 as at 12 April
                    2010 with vacant possession free from all encumbrances but excluding the value
                    of the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant obtained a valuation from Knight
                    Frank which valued the undepreciated building value to be $335,000 as at
                    14 April 2010. The building was completed in 1959 and was thus 51 years
                    old. Adopting a building lifespan of 65 years (given that periodic renovation
                    and repair works had been carried out), Knight Frank used a depreciation factor
                    of 78% (<em>i.e</em>. 51/65) and estimated the depreciated
                    building value to be $74,000 based on the Depreciated Replacement Cost
                    Method.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I noted that the two professional valuers
                    independently selected the same valuation method and the same lifespan to arrive
                    at their valuations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With both valuations being far below the
                    compensation offer from the plaintiff, I gave the defendant a second opportunity
                    to reconsider whether to accept the plaintiff’s offer or proceed with the
                    hearing, in which case he might well end up far worse off than if he had
                    accepted the compensation offered. The defendant chose to proceed with the
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, I considered what would be a
                    reasonable compensation for the house on an objective basis having regard to the
                    two professional valuation reports obtained by the parties. I regarded the
                    higher valuation of Knight Frank to represent a fair and reasonable compensation
                    for the replacement cost of the house in its present condition and ordered that
                    compensation of $74,000 be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. I further
                    ordered the defendant to vacate the premises within 4 months. Each party would
                    bear its own costs. The defendant was also ordered to pay the outstanding ground
                    rent up to the date of delivery of vacant possession which was to be set off
                    against the amount of compensation payable to the defendant.</p>
