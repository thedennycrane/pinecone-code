The plaintiff, Mr Toh Eng Tiah (“the Plaintiff”), and the defendant, Ms Angelina Jiang (“the Defendant”), were previously in a romantic relationship. During their time together, the Plaintiff transferred sums of money to the Defendant. The Plaintiff now brings this action in an attempt to recover a total sum of $2m from the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The main thrust of the Plaintiff’s case is that the sums paid at various times were loans and not love gifts. He relies heavily on a Loan Facility Agreement dated 24 March 2017 (“$2m Loan Agreement”) in support of this contention. However, in a bid to recover the $2m immediately (rather than pursuant to the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement), the Plaintiff further contends that the $2m Loan Agreement ought to be rescinded on the basis of undue influence, <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum,</span> unilateral mistake, or misrepresentation, among other grounds.  The Defendant, however, says that the various sums amounting to $2m were gifts; the parties were more than lovers and there were plans to start a family together. She further contends that the $2m Loan Agreement is a sham document, created for the Plaintiff to negotiate with his wife in respect of an intended divorce, and to obtain financing from the Plaintiff’s company. She also counterclaims for an aggregate sum of $335,000 lent to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff is a self-made man and owner of several businesses past and present.

The Plaintiff’s case is that the $2m Loan Agreement evidences his intention that the various sums advanced or to be advanced to the Defendant were loans. The Defendant, however, argues that the $2m Loan Agreement is a sham document meant to be used as a bargaining chip by the Plaintiff for negotiating the division of assets with his wife in relation to their intended divorce

The mere fact that a recipient regards the thing given as a loan and intends  to so treat it does not by itself prevent the transaction from being effective as a gift (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span> vol 52 (LexisNexis, 2014) at 201):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A gift made between living persons (<span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">vivos</span>) may be defined shortly as the transfer of any property from one person to another gratituously while the donor is alive and not in expectation of death. It is an act whereby something is voluntarily transferred from the true owner in possession to another person with the full intention that the thing shall not return to the donor. It has been said that there must be an intention on the part of the recipient to retain the thing entirely without restoring it to the giver, but it seems that this is incorrect and that a gift is effective when the donor intends to make it a gift and the recipient takes the thing given and keeps it, knowing that he has done so: <span class="font-italic">the mere fact that the recipient regards the thing given as a loan and intends so to treat it does not by itself prevent the </span><span class="font-italic">transaction as being effective as a gift</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Once given, a donor cannot resile from his position and subsequently seek to convert a gift into a loan. This is because once there has been a voluntary transfer of a gift, and a full intention that the gift shall not return, the donor parts fully with the property: see <span class="font-italic">Chung </span><span class="font-italic">Khin Chun K (by her deputy Mok Chiu Ling Hedy) v Yang Yin and others </span>[2015] 5 SLR 467 at [41]. The gift is no longer his to convert into a loan. As was noted by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dr Giuseppe Franco v Dr Elena </span><span class="font-italic">Sciaroni </span>[2002] 12 WLUK 348 at [79]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The fact that she now bitterly regrets having been so generous to the Claimant over so many years is understandable, but that cannot of itself alter the legal basis on which the money was <span class="font-italic">originally transferred</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The key is to examine the original intention of the donor in transferring the property in question. A change of heart does not change the legal nature of the transaction. The difficulty in every case is in ascertaining the intention of the donor. This is especially so in the context of a romantic relationship. When a relationship comes to an end, it is scarcely surprising that a donor would seek to deny his gifts. But this should not detract from any original intention to gift. To complicate matters, things are often said and done informally in such a relationship and the language used may be imprecise. A court, therefore, has to be perspicacious in assessing the evidence, taking into account:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the nature of the parties’ relationship; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the choice of words by the parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the frequency of certain promises; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the consistency of the a party’s conduct with the promises made; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) a party’s means to make good the promises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Can a loan be converted into a gift? It may, subject to certain conditions. As noted above, a loan is essentially a contract under which a sum has been transferred with the expectation that the sum be repaid. Where a loan is forgiven, there is forbearance. It is a waiver of a contractual right for which there must be a clear and unequivocal intention to that effect, along with fresh consideration: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang BL, gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 18.056 and <span class="font-italic">Sean Wilken QC </span>and <span class="font-italic">Karim </span><span class="font-italic">Ghaly</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Waiver, Variation, </span><span class="font-italic">and Estoppel </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012) at paras 4.28–4.29). Alternatively, where there is a representation that the loan will not be enforced, and the recipient relies on the representation and suffers detriment as a result, the borrower may be estopped from asserting his strict legal rights to the sum (<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 409 at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether gift or loan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Before  answering this question I should make some observations about the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Plaintiff has pleaded a whole host of vitiating factors in respect of the $2m Loan Agreement. If this court comes to the conclusion that the constituent sums in question were gifts, there would be no need to examine the vitiating factors in respect of those sums as the $2m Loan Agreement could not have converted a gift into a loan (see [34] above). Similarly, there can be no <span class="font-italic">Q</span><span class="font-italic">uistclose </span>trust if the sum were given as an outright gift. The Plaintiff would have no beneficial interest in the sum then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I should also mention that while the Defendant argues that the Plaintiff is estopped from enforcing his strict legal rights (presumably on account of promissory estoppel), the Defendant did not plead material facts showing detriment. Indeed, the issue of detrimental reliance was not seriously, if at all, pursued at trial. The Defendant made an attempt at addressing detrimental reliance in her closing submissions but this is not enough, the point must be sufficiently pleaded. In any event, I am unpersuaded by her contention. She argues that as she trusted the Plaintiff, she did not insist on having the Plaintiff sign the Deed of Gift and that this constituted detrimental reliance. I fail to see what detriment the Defendant has suffered. The Defendant’s decision to trust the Plaintiff was a personal choice. From the foregoing, it is sufficient for me to disregard the Defendant’s arguments on estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of the parties’ relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I begin with a brief description of the parties’ relationship as this is the backdrop to the various transactions that constitute the Plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 While the parties’ relationship did not last long, the Plaintiff accepts that during the time that they were together, the parties cared for and loved each other.

</div> He also suggested that promises were given to the Defendant but not at the Temple. The evidence does not support him. I accept the Defendant’s evidence that the Plaintiff did promise to provide for her and had wanted to start a family with her. I also accept the Defendant’s evidence that the Plaintiff had wanted to purchase a matrimonial home. I further find that by 25 January 2017, the Plaintiff had informed the Defendant that he intended to divorce his wife. The Defendant deposed that on 25 January 2017, the Plaintiff informed her that his wife had already engaged a divorce lawyer and asked her to help him find one as well.

The sum was advanced to the Defendant to assist her in the acquisition of 315 Balestier Road. At the Defendant’s suggestion, the parties entered into the $200,000 Loan Agreement. This is unsurprising because the parties had just met the month before. Although they met frequently thereafter, the Defendant had not accepted the Plaintiff as her lover yet and was thus unwilling to accept the amount as a gift. The Defendant does not dispute these facts. Her position, however, is that on the night of their first sexual encounter (see [6] above), the Plaintiff told her that the $200,000 was a gift and tore up the $200,000 Loan Agreement.

These overtures to take care of the Defendant’s financial troubles, to bear her “financial debts” and the vows are significant because by 29 December 2016, the Plaintiff had learnt of the Defendant’s financial situation.

Indeed immediately after the Plaintiff’s promise to bear the Defendant’s “financial debts”, the Defendant sent the Plaintiff a list of debts she owed various banks and requested for the $10,000.

</div> While the WeChat messages were instructive in shedding light on the extent of the parties’ relationship and the intention behind the advances, it is artificial to expect the parties to carefully record each transaction in the form of a text message and categorically label the sum as either a gift or a loan. The general tenor of the WeChat messages was that the sums were gifts. The Plaintiff has not been able to point to any objective evidence otherwise. Unless there is something to indicate that a particular transaction may not be a gift, as in the case of item 1 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the $200,000 loan), the inference that the sums are gifts remains unrebutted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I make a simple observation at this point. In the Plaintiff’s mind, both parties were actively courting each other. Would a man hot in the pursuit of a lady’s heart offer to lend her sums of money or is it more likely that the sums were gifts to win her heart? This is more so when the parties were looking to start a life together. To quote the Hong Kong District Court in <span class="font-italic">Yeung </span><span class="font-italic">Nga Lai v Tang Chun Lok </span>[2018] HKDC 264 at [33]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In terms of inherent probabilities, there was not much benefit for the plaintiff to create [a] creditor-debtor relationship with her husband-to-be at the time when they were busily preparing for their forthcoming marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Plaintiff further submits that the Defendant herself had mentioned that she would return the monies to the Plaintiff.

In those text messages, the Defendant began expressing doubts and grief about being together with a married man. She threatened to return the monies as a sign of breaking up. In respect of the messages dated 27 January 2017, the Defendant told the Plaintiff that she could not “do this”, presumably referring to their relationship, and wanted to return home to her family.

</div> In respect of the message dated 28 January 2017, the message highlighted by the Plaintiff was preceded by her saying: “My older sister has already scolded me. I have come to my senses. I can’t allow a married couple to hurt me any more. All my words are from the bottom of my heart and they are the truth, unlike you.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this connection, the parties disagreed over the authenticity of certain WeChat messages purportedly photographed by the Plaintiff’s wife. Those messages sought to show that the Defendant herself had thought the sums to have been loans or had suggested repayment. While some of the messages appear in the Defendant’s phone, the Defendant claims that the rest of the messages were fabricated. Experts were called to testify on the point. In my view, none of that was necessary. Taking the Plaintiff’s case at its highest and assuming that the WeChat messages that were photographed were authentic, these messages would not have changed my analysis above. The short point is this – regardless of the Defendant’s characterisation of the nature of the various sums, the overwhelming evidence points to the Plaintiff’s intention to gift the sums in question to the Defendant. What matters is the donor’s intention and not that of the recipient (see [35] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, the Plaintiff relies heavily on the $2m Loan Agreement to contend that the aggregate sum of $724,532 is a loan.

With the exception of the $200,000 loan (the 1st transfer) before the parties became intimate, the various sums transferred have all along been gifts. Nothing in the evidence suggests that the sum of $154,000 is to be regarded as anything but a gift.

Indeed, on 24 December 2016 the Plaintiff texted the Defendant the following: “My goal is to buy a house near NTU for you next year”. In response, the Defendant said: “Hillcrest Villa, our home”. And the Plaintiff said, “Yes”. Early next year, on 12 January 2017, the parties went to the Temple and engraved their names on an ancestral tablet. The Plaintiff vowed then to buy a house for the Defendant and to set up a home with her. That same day, they decided to buy a property at 3H Hillcrest Road and paid an option fee for the same.

Notably, he does not dispute that he rejected the Defendant’s proposal to convert the Plaintiff’s proposed contribution of $2m into a 30% stake in 9 Hillcrest Road and a 20% stake in her apartment at 13 Prome Road as he did not want to be seen as taking advantage of her. Indeed, in a corresponding WeChat message, the Plaintiff had said: “To conclude, I will remain the same towards you”.

</div> In the circumstances, it is more probable than not that the payment of the $154,000 deposit was a gift. The Plaintiff did not intend to create a creditor-debtor relationship but had instead intended to purchase a matrimonial home for the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I further note that the Plaintiff is not claiming repayment of the $28,300 option fee that the parties forfeited when they decided not to proceed with purchasing 3H Hillcrest Road. The fact that the Plaintiff is claiming repayment of the $154,000 deposit for 9 Hillcrest but not the $28,300 for 3H Hillcrest Road is somewhat incongruous. If the Plaintiff had been advancing loans to the Defendant to purchase property for investment, it stands to reason that the sum of $28,300 would also have featured as part of his claims. This is especially so since both $28,300 and $154,000 were paid in respect of properties that were viewed around the same time and were, according to the Plaintiff’s statement in his AEIC, part of the Defendant’s investment plans:

According to the Defendant, in or around February 2017, the Plaintiff told her that his wife was preventing him from taking money from his companies and was also making it difficult for him to divorce her. He also said that his wife had been spreading word in his office that he had been so blinded by love that he had given away large sums of money. She had also insisted that to be fair to her, the Plaintiff had to transfer 10% of his shares in ST Paper to her, failing which she would not agree to an unconstested divorce.

The Plaintiff explained to her that Ms Chong of Infinitus was simply doing her job as his lawyer and was trying to protect his rights since he had not informed Ms Chong that the $2m Loan Agreement was meant to “assuage” his wife. After some discussion between the parties, it was agreed that the $2m Loan Agreement would contain the Defendant’s Proposed Terms and an additional Redemption Clause stating that in the event that the Plaintiff passed away before the Defendant repaid the sum of $2m, the loan facility would be deemed fully repaid. This Redemption Clause was included because the Plaintiff was suffering from stomach cancer and according to the Defendant, the Plaintiff suggested this clause so that his wife would not be able to make any claims against the Defendant in the event of his death.

The Plaintiff was unaccompanied by his lawyers. According to the Defendant, when Mr Yong of Legal Solutions told the Plaintiff that he could not communicate with the Plaintiff in the absence of the Plaintiff’s lawyers, the Plaintiff informed Mr Yong that he had discharged his lawyers as he considered the $2m Loan Agreement to be a private matter between the Defendant and himself.

The Plaintiff was accompanied by the Defendant and Mr Yong’s secretary, Ms Ong Hsiao Li (“Ms Ong”). After signing the $2m Loan Agreement, the Plaintiff handed the Defendant a cheque for $872,000.

He agreed to sign the loan agreement but owing to the shortness of time and in reliance upon the representations made by the Defendant, the Plaintiff claims to have been under the mistaken belief that the loan agreement he signed was what Ms Chong had amended and advised him on.

In one part of her AEIC, the Defendant deposed that on 5 April 2017, the Plaintiff informed her that he was unable to obtain the balance sum of $1.128m (therefore the balance which together with the $872,000 already transferred would add up to $2 million)  to pay for 9 Hillcrest Road. The Plaintiff therefore told the Defendant not to proceed with the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road.

</div> In another part of the Defendant’s AEIC, she deposed that on or around 26 March 2017, her Citibank agent informed her that the deposit of $250,000 was not enough for her to obtain a loan of $1.54m, and that she would either have to pledge a sum of $880,000 or “show funds of $2.89m”. Since the Plaintiff had neither given the Defendant the sum of $2m nor the sum of $2.89m needed for the bank loan, the Defendant could not afford to purchase 9 Hillcrest Road. On 31 March 2017, the Defendant’s solicitors therefore wrote to the vendor’s solicitors stating that she was unable to proceed with the purchase of the property.

Note however, the important caution in [122] where the CA stated: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">“One qualification to our endorsement of the contextual approach, must, however, be made. In the light of the continued robustness of the parol evidence rule in our law, the courts must remain ever vigilant to ensure that, in interpreting a contract, extrinsic evidence is only employed to illuminate the contractual language and not as a pretext to contradict or vary it.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The plain language of the $2m Loan Agreement supports the Plaintiff’s contention. It refers to the parties as “Lender” and “Borrower”. Clause 2 refers to the “Loan Facility of Singapore Dollars Two Million” out of which “the Lender has advanced…(S$1,128,000)” and the balance of which “will be disbursed to the Borrower after the execution of this Agreement….for the amount of….(S$872,000)”.

</div>
</div>
</div>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It is important to note that the parties were legally represented in the preparation of the $2m Loan Agreement. Proposals and counter-proposals of terms in seeming earnest through solicitors would not have been necessary if the $2m Loan Agreement was intended to be only a “ploy”. This context is clear, obvious and known to both parties and it favours an objective interpretation of the $2m Loan Agreement according to its plain meaning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The parties’ intention is thus to be found in the language of the $2m Loan Agreement; evidence of their actual intentions or expectations before or at the time of the contract cannot be adduced to contradict the written document save where rectification is sought. The parol evidence rule begins with s93 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “Evidence Act”). Section 94 further provides that where the contract is reduced to writing such that s93 applies, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement can be relied upon by the parties “for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to provisos (a) to (f)”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Defendant’s evidence that the $2m Loan Agreement was just a “ploy” is difficult to believe. How such an agreement could have been thought capable of achieving the alleged objectives set out in [83] is doubtful, to say the least. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In any event and more importantly, such evidence cannot be allowed to contradict the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I should add that the objective ascertainment of the parties’ intentions is especially important where a third party has to rely on its terms. We have seen that clause 4 of the $2m Loan Agreement provides that if the Lender should die before the Redemption Date, the loan shall be deemed fully repaid. This is so that the Plaintiff’s estate (likely represented by his widow) will not be able to proceed against the Defendant. If the Plaintiff were to die after the Redemption Date, or after the Defendant had sold her property at 13 Prome Road, repayment would fall due under Clause 3.1 of the $2m Loan Agreement and the Plaintiff’s estate would be entitled to full repayment. The widow would not be privy to the alleged intention of the parties that the $2m Loan Agreement was only a ploy and a sham. In the words of Doherty J.A. in <span class="font-italic">Dumbrell</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Regional Group of Companies Inc</span> 85 OR(3d) 616 at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“… emphasis on subjective intention denudes the contractual arrangement of the certainty that reducing an arrangement to writing was intended to achieve. This is particularly important where, as is often the case, strangers to the contract must rely on its terms. They have no way of discerning the actual intention of the parties, but must rely on the intent expressed in the written words.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Even if it was argued that the understanding between the parties (that the Plaintiff would not enforce the $2m Loan Agreement against her) was a collateral agreement, this would not assist the Defendant. Since evidence of such a collateral agreement would be inconsistent with the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement, it would be inadmissible under  s 94<span class="font-italic">(b)</span> of the Evidence Act:see <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30 at [21]; also see <span class="font-italic">Ng Lay Choo Marion v </span><span class="font-italic">Lok Lai Oi</span><span class="font-underline"> </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 77 at [14] and [15]. Neither does it fall within s94<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">d)</span> because the alleged collateral agreement would have arisen before and not subsequent to the $2m Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Defendant raised a further submission that the outstanding loan under the $2m Loan Agreement was a gift by subsequent agreement relying upon certain WeChat messages the Plaintiff sent her after the $2m Loan Agreement was signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 First, there was a message on 25 April 2017, in which the Plaintiff texted

</div>, a reward of $2 million would be given to her for giving birth to a daughter. Contrary to what her counsel submitted, the reward was not for a pregnancy but for the birth of a daughter. This did not happen as she had a miscarriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As regards (a), the reasoning behind the paragraph in the Defendant’s closing submissions set out at [127] is somewhat convoluted. The evidence of the Defendant, as set out in [90] was that in the course of persuading her to execute the $2m Loan Agreement, the Plaintiff had assured her that if she agreed to his proposal: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) he would provide her with the full sum of $2 million before the completion date for the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road notwithstanding what was said in the $2 million Loan Agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) he would give her $250,000 to deposit into her Citibank account so that she could be upgraded to a Citigold membership and obtain a bank loan for $1.54 million to complete the purchase of the property.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I doubt the Defendant’s evidence in this regard. As I observed earlier, the effort put into preparation of the $2m Loan Agreement gives the lie to this account. In any event, such evidence in [91] above is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule as its purport is to convert what is clearly a loan of $872,000 under the $2m Loan Agreement into a gift of that amount with a balance of $1,128,000 yet to be given. Accordingly, the alleged forgoing of the $1,128,000 cannot constitute consideration for the discharge of the loan by subsequent agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In conclusion, the $872,000 was lent pursuant to the $2m Loan Agreement and remains outstanding as a loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 What about the $250,000 that was transferred to the Defendant by cheque dated 21 March 2017? It will be recalled that this was in the midst of parties’ solicitors exchanging drafts of the $2m Loan Agreement and that the execution of the said Agreement was on 24 March 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 As recounted in [92] the Plaintiff’s evidence was that he advanced the $250,000 to her at her request. She informed that she needed $1m to be deposited in her bank account to obtain a bank loan to finance the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road. The Plaintiff informed her that he could only advance $250,000 and would release the remaining sum to her later. The Defendant’s evidence is set out in [90] and [91].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that the $250,000 was lent to the Defendant. The parties were in the midst of negotiations on the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement when the $250,000 was transferred. Unlike the earlier gifts, there is nothing to show that the Plaintiff intended it as a gift. The Defendant exhibited a handwritten note from the Plaintiff to her

</div>  which she said detailed the gifts he had previously given to her. I observe that in that handwritten note, the Plaintiff did mention a figure of $250,000 but did not aggregate it with gifts that had been made. Instead it appeared under the balance that was to be lent. However, I do not make too much of this. More significantly, in the absence of any indication on his part that he intended to make a gift of the $250,000 and the transfer having taken place on the cusp of the loan signing, I find it more likely than not that it was a loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 It may be asked if my findings here are inconsistent with my earlier finding that the sum of $154,000 paid as a deposit was a gift. In my view, the distinction is this – the sums adding up to $154,000 were not transferred pursuant to the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement, nor was a loan agreement then on the horizon. Instead the $154,000 was paid pursuant to a promise by the Plaintiff to buy the Defendant a matrimonial home. In contrast, the sum of $250,000 was transferred at the time the $2m Loan Agreement was being negotiated. Objectively understood, the parties had changed their arrangement as regards the outstanding financing for 9 Hillcrest Road. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In the result, I find that the sums of $200,000, $250,000 and $872,000 are loans whereas all the other sums are gifts. As the sum of $200,000 is long overdue, I hold that the Plaintiff is entitled to repayment forthwith. As for the sums of $250,000 and $872,000, repayment must be in accordance with the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement. In this regard, the $2m Loan Agreement provides the following:

In terms of the requirements for finding that there was a trust, Lord Hoffmann took the view that it was key for there to be a stated purpose and an intention to restrict the recipient’s disposal of the transferred property (at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Notwithstanding differing views as to the nature of the trust, for a Quistclose trust to arise there must at the very least be a specified purpose for which the property was advanced and a restriction on the recipient’s disposition of the property. As Lord Millett observed (<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73]–[74]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 A <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>trust does not necessarily arise merely because money is paid for a particular purpose. A lender will often inquire into the purpose for which a loan is sought in order to decide whether he would be justified in making it. He may be said to lend the money for the purpose in question, but this is not enough to create a trust; once lent the money is at the free disposal of the borrower. Similarly payments in advance for goods or services are paid for a particular purpose, but such payments do not ordinarily create a trust. The money is intended to be at the free disposal of the supplier and may be used as part of his cashflow. Commercial life would be impossible if this were not the case. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 The question in every case is whether the parties intended the money to be at the free disposal of the recipient: <span class="font-italic">In re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd </span>[1995] 1 AC 74, 100 per Lord Mustill. His freedom to dispose of the money is necessarily excluded by an arrangement that the money shall be used <span class="font-italic">exclusively </span>for the stated purpose … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 While cl 2.4 of the $2m Loan Agreement does provide that “[t]he purpose of the [$2m Loan Agreement] is for the purchase of [9 Hillcrest Road]”, there is no agreement that the Defendant is restricted from having free disposition of the amount advanced. In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> there was an express undertaking that the loaned sum was to be “solely for the acquisition of property <span class="font-italic">and no other purpose</span>” [emphasis in original]: at [75]. Similarly in <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span>, there was an exclusive purpose to the loan as expressed in the terms of a letter (see [58]). The Plaintiff has not pointed to any express term restricting the Defendant’s disposition of any sum advanced under the $2m Loan Agreement. Neither has the Plaintiff shown a mutual understanding that the Defendant was not to have free disposition of the sum advanced under the $2m Loan Agreement. In the circumstances, no <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>trust can arise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defendant’s counterclaim </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sum sought under the counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I now turn to the Defendant’s counterclaim. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff had sought loans from her on several occasions. As noted at [9], the Defendant claims that a sum totalling $95,000 was advanced to the Plaintiff as a loan.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Apart from the loans, the Defendant is also seeking compensation for the termination of the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road as well as other personal and medical expenses. I reproduce the salient portions of the counterclaim:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49A. As a consequence of the termination of the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road, on or about 21 May 2017, the Defendant paid a sum of $60,000.00 to the vendor of 9 Hillcrest Road as compensation. In the premises, the Defendant has suffered loss and damage. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49B. In reliance on the Plaintiff’s Vows to love and take care of her for the rest of her life, the Defendant also incurred the following sums:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a) S$20,000.00 as medical expenses for her pregnancy, the DNA tests and her subsequent miscarriage; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b) S$10,000.00 for deposits and rental payments for two units at The Centris Condominium, namely units #06-13 and #12-43, as the Plaintiff had initially wanted to rent these condominium apartments but subsequently changed his mind and decided against it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The Defendant is therefore seeking a total sum of $335,000 from the Plaintiff in her counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Compensation Sums </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I begin with the compensation sums (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $60,000, $20,000 and $10,000). These claims are dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As regards the sum of $60,000, the Defendant is essentially seeking an indemnity from the Plaintiff for the compensation she had to pay as a result of her terminating the purchase of 9 Hillcrest Road. It is unclear what the basis for this claim is. The Defendant is the contracting party with the vendor. While there was an arrangement as to the financing of 9 Hillcrest Road, there is no separate binding agreement between the Plaintiff and Defendant to indemnify her. And even if the Plaintiff had mentioned that he would pay for the compensation in the event the purchase was terminated, this would have been a gratuitous promise. The Defendant cannot enforce that promise against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 As regards the sums of $20,000 and $10,000, it is similarly unclear what the cause of action is. The Defendant pleads her “reliance” on the Plaintiff’s vows. This appears to be an attempt at reaching for some species of estoppel. But the court is unable to second guess the Defendant’s cause of action. Insofar as the counterclaim is premised on promissory estoppel, the Defendant is effectively using the doctrine as a sword and not as a shield. This is without legal basis. In any event, there is no evidence showing detriment as a result of the Defendant’s reliance on the vows. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Loaned sums. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Turning then to the loaned sums, the Defendant stated that on 31 March 2017, she transferred $150,000 to the Plaintiff at his request. This is because the Plaintiff wanted to prove to his wife that the Defendant’s love for him was genuine and that she was not simply after his money.

</div> In my view, regardless of the motivations for the transference, the evidence is clear – this sum is a loan, and I so find. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In a series of WeChat messages dated 4 April 2017, the Plaintiff repeatedly assured the Defendant that he would repay her the sum:

This sum of $95,000 comprised various transfers made between January and February 2017. Apart from her own affidavit and oral evidence that the transfers were loans, the Defendant has adduced WeChat messages showing that the Plaintiff had indeed sought a loan for some of the transfers. On the other hand, the Plaintiff characterised the sum of $95,000 as part-repayment for the $819,532 transferred between December 2016 to March 2017 (see [9] above). I have found that apart from the sum of $200,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, item 1), the rest of the sums were gifts. The Plaintiff has also not demonstrated that the Defendant’s transfer of $95,000 to him was repayment of the $200,000 debt. In the circumstances, I find that the $95,000 was a loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Overall, the Defendant is entitled to repayment of $245,000. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for $200,000, $250,000 and $872,000. While the Plaintiff is entitled to the sum of $200,000 forthwith, his entitlement to the sums of $250,000 and $872,000 must follow the terms of the $2m Loan Agreement, namely cl 3. I also allow the Defendant’s counterclaim for a total of $245,000. The Defendant has pleaded for a set-off of sums due to her against sums due to the Plaintiff. I therefore hold that the Defendant is entitled to $45,000. I am not inclined to award any interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Ang  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Hwee Khiam Anthony, Wang Liansheng and Gursharn Singh Gill (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Mahesh Rai and Stephania Wong (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
