When purchasers resell their flats after satisfying the Minimum Occupation Period, they can thus expect to make a profit, with some resale transactions even breaching the $1 million mark (partly due to a rising property market).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The HDB does not however allow purchasers to buy a series of flats as if they were first-time owners. A resale levy is imposed to maintain a fair allocation of public housing subsidies between first-time purchasers and repeat purchasers by reducing the subsidy enjoyed on the second (or subsequent) subsidised HDB flat. Can that resale levy be evaded by using a nominee to purchase the subsequent flats, without jeopardising one’s ability to be recognised as the real owner?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the present case, Mr and Mrs Lim (the plaintiffs) claimed to have done so. They contended that the HDB flat in the sole name of their son, Teck Leng (the first defendant), was beneficially owned by them, and that Teck Leng had no beneficial interest in it whatsoever. Mr and Mrs Lim said (and Teck Leng agreed) that one reason for this alleged arrangement was to avoid paying a $40,000 resale levy to the HDB. They contended that the law nevertheless allowed them to be recognised as the real owners of the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 This judgment examines the legal consequences of such an arrangement, which prospective HDB flat owners would do well to bear in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The HDB flat in question was located along Kim Tian Road (the “Kim Tian Flat”). Teck Leng had paid for the Kim Tian Flat using: proceeds from an earlier flat that was also in his sole name (the “Silat Flat”); money from his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account; and an HDB housing loan that was serviced from his CPF account. It was however alleged that Teck Leng was a mere nominee, and that this arrangement was intended to have the dual purpose of (a) allowing the parents to evade payment of a resale levy to the HDB, and (b) allowing for a housing loan to be obtained from the HDB (which Teck Leng, but not his parents, was eligible for). The parents alleged that this was their common understanding with Teck Leng. They also argued that they should be regarded as having paid for the Kim Tian Flat, because they had given Teck Leng more than enough money to pay for it. Teck Leng’s position, however, was that the bulk of that money had been lost by him in failed investments or spent by him.

</div> This was to be paid within six months from the date of the Ancillary Order. An order for the sale of the Kim Tian Flat was not made at that time, but it was later made on 10 May 2019 after Honghong had applied to enforce the Ancillary Order. Teck Leng was ordered to sell the Kim Tian Flat if he did not pay Honghong $175,000 by 10 August 2019 (the “Sale Order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The plaintiffs commenced this action on 21 October 2019, more than five months after the Sale Order had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I find that Teck Leng was the beneficial owner of the Kim Tian Flat, not his parents. The Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“HDA”) did not allow the parents to become entitled to the Kim Tian Flat (or any interest in it) under the nominee arrangement that they alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Even if the nominee arrangement survived the HDA, the parents would still not be the beneficial owners of the Kim Tian Flat. The facts did not support either a resulting trust or a common intention constructive trust in favour of the parents. What Teck Leng received from his parents was more in the nature of a loan, rather than money he had been entrusted with for the purpose of purchasing the Silat Flat and the Kim Tian Flat. In any event, only some 9.1% of the cost of acquiring the Kim Tian Flat could be traced back to money Teck Leng had received from his parents, and any interest that his parents had would not exceed that proportion. Teck Leng admitted that he had “depleted” the rest of the money from his parents.

However, [Teck Leng] convinced us to register the Silat Flat under his name, leaving us as permitted occupiers as our old age prevented us from obtaining housing loans to finance the flat. Further, as we had bought and sold an HDB flat previously, we would have incurred an HDB resale levy if we were to be the owners of the [Kim Tian Flat]. This resale levy would have been a substantial portion of our savings, which would have been better served as payment to the [Kim Tian Flat] itself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 We reiterate that when the Silat Flat was purchased, the understanding between us and [Teck Leng] was that [Teck Leng] would use the sales proceeds from the CCK Flat to fully pay off the Silat Flat and use the compensation of the Silat Flat under SERS to subsequently pay off the replacement SERS flat at Kim Tian Road.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 … [I]t was always our understanding that the Silat Flat and the [Kim Tian Flat] belonged to us as the monies used to purchase these properties were from the sale proceeds of the CCK Flat, which we had paid for fully with our CPF and life savings, as well as our life savings that we had entrusted to [Teck Leng].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 We aver that the total monies we had entrusted to [Teck Leng] amounting to $332,626.08 was sufficient to fully pay for the Silat Flat and subsequently, the [Kim Tian Flat]. Hence, we verily believe that any financial contributions [Teck Leng] had made to the purchase of the [Kim Tian Flat] and all the money that he paid towards the [Kim Tian Flat] were from the monies we had entrusted to him, either as the nett sales proceeds from the sale of the CCK Flat or as our life savings which he was to invest for higher returns. [Teck Leng] thus made no financial contributions to the [Kim Tian Flat]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The parents’ case was that there was an understanding that Teck Leng would merely be their nominee for purchasing subsequent flats. In particular, they claimed that it was agreed amongst them that the parents would be the beneficial owners of the Kim Tian Flat although the flat would be registered in Teck Leng’s sole name – the primary motivation for this nominee arrangement being the parents’ desire to avoid payment of a $40,000 resale levy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The alleged understanding that the parents were the owners of the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat is premised on Teck Leng’s being obliged to use the parents’ money to pay for those flats (see [38] above). This is reinforced by para 13 of the parents’ second joint affidavit dated 1 April 2020, where they said that the entire net sales proceeds for the CCK Flat went into Mr Lim’s and Teck Leng’s joint account, but clarified that “… this [was] not a gift or advancement to [Teck Leng] but was for the <span class="font-italic">sole purpose</span> of purchasing the Silat Flat or any other property for us (i.e. us, [Teck Leng], and our children) to stay in” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Teck Leng supported his parents’ claim. His account, as set out in his affidavit dated 14 February 2020, is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6 What the [parents] stated in their affidavit are true. My parents owned the [CCK Flat]. I knew that the Silat Walk flat was announced under the SERS and a new replacement flat in Kim Tian Road will be allocated so I discussed with my parents on the opportunity to make a profit out of the new replacement flat and moving to a new flat in a better location. They agreed and they handled [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] me their life savings and sold the [CCK Flat] and handed me all the monies to put into the Silat Walk flat. Not longer after, the Silat Walk flat was compulsory [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] acquired under the SERS programme and HDB gave us a replacement flat in Kim Tian Road. The monies from my parents was sufficient to pay for the Kim Tian Road flat but I took a loan as it made more economic sense. I enjoy a low interest rate from HDB and get free cash to invest and spend. However, the investments failed and I spent the monies on the family after the marriage. I lavish gifts on [Honghong] and the family did not watch my spending.  When we were on good terms, I did not think much of how I spend on the family. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 Besides giving me all the sale proceeds from the [CCK Flat], my parents passed me their life savings for payment of the [Kim Tian Flat] and I have depleted all during the marriage. I am terribly embarrassed and sorry to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Based on the parents’ evidence (and Teck Leng’s), the parents asserted that they were entitled to the Kim Tian Flat on a resulting trust or a common intention constructive trust.

Section 51(10) of the HDA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) No person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created or arising.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I find that a trust that has purportedly been created in contravention of ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA cannot be saved by seeking to recharacterise it as a resulting or constructive trust.

First, on the parents’ own account, the alleged trust was created with the express intention of defeating HDB regulation or policy. Second, even if the alleged trust had been created for legitimate reasons, it would still contravene s 51(8) of the HDA as the parents did not obtain the HDB’s prior written approval. Third, the parents’ eligibility to purchase the Silat Flat and Kim Tian Flat themselves is irrelevant to the applicability of ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA; but even if their eligibility were relevant, they <span class="font-italic">were</span> ineligible owners in that they could not have purchased the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat without paying a resale levy (payment of which they sought to evade) or with the benefit of an HDB housing loan (which they were not eligible to obtain).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen and others v Cheong Kwok Kiong </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1126 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong</span>”), the Court of Appeal considered the predecessors to the present ss 51(8) and 51(9), namely, ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “1997 HDA”), which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) No trust in respect of any such flat, house or other building shall be created by the owner thereof without the prior written approval of the Board.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Every trust which purports to be created in respect of any such flat, house or other building without the prior written approval of the Board shall be void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There is no material distinction between the above provisions and ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA in their present form. The phrase “such flat, house or other building” has been replaced with the phrase “protected property” as defined in s 51(11) of the HDA, but it was common ground amongst the parties that the flats in the present case were “protected property”, and that s 51 of the HDA did apply to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The respondent in <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span> brought his claim on the basis of a resulting trust. By way of background, the HDB flat in question was registered in the joint names of the respondent and his mother. The respondent was subsequently allocated a new HDB flat (the “new flat”). As individuals could not own more than one flat at any one time (by virtue of s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the 1997 HDA), the respondent ostensibly transferred his interest in the first flat to his mother, who thereby became the sole owner of the first flat. After his mother’s death, however, the respondent asserted that he still had a beneficial interest in the first flat by way of a resulting trust as he had paid the purchase price and all outgoings of that flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Court of Appeal held that the alleged trust was prohibited by s 51(4) and was null and void under s 51(5) of the 1997 HDA. In arriving at its conclusion, the Court of Appeal was guided by the underlying purpose of the prohibition and the policy of the 1997 HDA. The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span> (at [19]) is especially relevant to the present case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Despite the relaxation of the prohibition to permit creation of trusts with the prior written approval of HDB, the underlying purpose of the prohibition remains unchanged. In our view, the respondent’s contention that resulting trusts over HDB properties are not prohibited by s 51(4) of the [1997 HDA] would give rise to a highly unsatisfactory result and <span class="font-italic">would open the way to abuse by persons who would and could easily purchase HDB properties through nominees</span>. For instance, if a purchaser pays the purchase money for the property and the property is registered in the name of a nominee but he takes a declaration of trust executed by the nominee in his favour without HDB’s prior written approval, such a trust will be prohibited by s 51(4) and becomes void under s 51(5) of the [1997 HDA]. <span class="font-italic">On the other hand, if no such declaration is executed, the trust which arises by operation of law is not caught by s 51(4).

The alleged trust was thus subject to ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA. It was immaterial that the respondent had sought to style the alleged trust as a resulting trust, which his counsel unsuccessfully contended did not fall within the ambit of ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA as it could not be “created” by anyone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Counsel for the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>argued that the policy consideration behind ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA was that the HDB should not be deceived into selling HDB properties to persons who would not be entitled to purchase such properties.

</div> It should be noted that the Court of Appeal did not accept that this was indeed a policy consideration of the HDB. The Court of Appeal simply held (at [22]–[23]) that <span class="font-italic">if</span> this were true, the restrictions on dual ownership of HDB properties (per s 47 of the 1997 HDA) meant that the respondent was in any event ineligible to hold any interest in the first flat upon acquiring the new flat. The Court of Appeal thus did not limit the application of ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA only to cases where the alleged beneficiary of the trust was not entitled or ineligible to purchase the flat himself.

This is supported by the decision in <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span> ([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>as well as the Ministerial Statement when those provisions were introduced (in their earlier form). Prior to their introduction, there was a blanket prohibition against the creation of any trust over HDB flats. The introduction of the subsections relaxed this categorical prohibition to “permit the creation of trusts for legitimate reasons”: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(24 August 1984) vol 44 at col 2025 (Teh Cheang Wan, Minister for National Development). The following extract from the Ministerial Statement was quoted in <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span> at [18]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the Act now stands, no trust in any form can be created in respect of an HDB dwelling or property. The original intention of this provision was to prevent abuse by persons not eligible for HDB flats from purchasing a flat in the name of nominees. Over the years, however, there has been increasing need for the HDB to permit the creation of trusts for legitimate reasons. For example, it is necessary to empower trustees to hold flats in trust for minor children who are citizens in the event of death of the lessee parent, and where the surviving parent is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident and therefore not eligible to assume ownership of the flat. Similarly, in some cases of legal separation or divorce, flats have to be held in trust for minor children until they reach the age of 21 years. Clause 3 of this Amendment Bill, therefore, seeks to allow a trust to be created in respect of an HDB dwelling <span class="font-italic">provided such trust is approved by the Board.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It should be noted that in relaxing the earlier blanket prohibition, Parliament chose approval by the HDB as the control mechanism. Thus, it would not suffice for a party to claim that a trust was created for legitimate reasons, not even reasons mentioned in the Ministerial Statement. As the then Minister for National Development said, such a trust could only be created “provided such trust is approved by the Board”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The lack of prior written approval from the HDB aside, the alleged trust in the present case was in any event not created for legitimate reasons. First, it was created to evade payment of a $40,000 HDB resale levy, which the parents would have had to pay if the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat were purchased in their names. Second, it was intended to allow for an HDB housing loan to be obtained. The parents were then not eligible for such a loan,

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The HDB’s policy of fairly promoting home ownership would be undermined if a nominee arrangement could be used to evade payment of the housing levy, and moreover to obtain an HDB loan which the intended owners of a flat were themselves not eligible for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The parents’ argument that s 51 of the HDA should not apply to defeat their claim, because they would have been eligible to purchase the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat, rings hollow. It is based on a narrow concept of eligibility, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the parents themselves form the requisite family nucleus for purchasing a flat. But the parents were not eligible to buy the flats without paying a $40,000 resale levy, so they chose instead to evade it by using Teck Leng as their nominee; they were not eligible to obtain a housing loan, so they again chose to circumvent this by using Teck Leng as their nominee. If the parents’ “eligibility” were relevant to whether ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA defeat their claim (and I am not persuaded that it is relevant – see [53]–[56] above), I would have found that the parents were not eligible to purchase the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat without paying a resale levy or with the benefit of an HDB housing loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the respondent had created a façade that his mother was the sole owner of the first flat, whilst intending to retain a beneficial interest in it; here, the parents and Teck Leng (as they allege) created a façade that Teck Leng was the sole owner of the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat, while supposedly intending that the parents would be the beneficial owners of those flats. Such conduct was not allowed under ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA, and I see no reason to permit it under ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Chong Sze Pak v Chong Ser </span><span class="font-italic">Yoong </span>[2011] 3 SLR 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong</span>”), the plaintiff’s claim based on a trust purportedly created without the prior written approval of the HDB failed, even though the plaintiff had tried to salvage his claim on the basis of a resulting or constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff alleged that when the defendant bought an HDB flat at Tronoh Road (the “Tronoh Road property”), they agreed that the defendant would hold the Tronoh Road property on trust for the plaintiff if the plaintiff paid for all of the Tronoh Road property’s outgoings. The defendant then executed a trust deed to this effect, with the plaintiff’s son as the beneficiary. The Tronoh Road property was subsequently acquired by the relevant authority and the defendant accepted a replacement flat at McNair Road (the “McNair Road property”) as compensation for the acquisition. When the McNair Road property was sold, the plaintiff claimed the net sale proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The court held (at [42] and [58]) that the trust purportedly created by the trust deed was an express trust that was null and void under ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA.

He sought to avoid the prohibition by suggesting that while he could not claim either property through the [t]rust [d]eed, he could claim the sale proceeds of the McNair Road property in equity.” On this, the court concluded at [59]: “The [p]laintiff’s attempt to claim the sale proceeds (of the McNair Road property) under a resulting trust, must also fail, see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen v Cheong Kwok Kiong</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1126 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong</span>”) at [13]–[19].

The court held (at [19]) that this was permissible: “There was, in this case, no intention on the part of any party to “create” a resulting trust to defeat the objectives of the [1997 HDA]. The conduct of the parties in this case was within the parameters set by the HDB and they at all times remained the registered owners of the flat.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the present case, the parents were not legal co-owners with Teck Leng of the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat; they claimed to have become co-owners pursuant to the alleged nominee arrangement.

The brief facts are as follows. The plaintiff and the defendant were siblings; the deceased (their mother) and the defendant held the HDB flat in question by way of a tenancy in common in a 99:1 ratio. The deceased subsequently passed away. It was undisputed that the plaintiff was entitled under the deceased’s estate to a half share of 99% of the flat. The plaintiff and the defendant then orally agreed that the HDB flat would be transferred to the defendant in exchange for the defendant’s payment of $325,000 to the plaintiff, as payment for the plaintiff’s half share of 99% of the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendant averred that in claiming half of 99% of the flat after transferring his legal interest in the same to the defendant, the plaintiff was in effect stating that he remained the beneficial owner of a 49.5% interest in the flat and that the defendant held this interest on trust for him (see [49] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Young Ching</span>). The court held (at [115] read with [103]–[104]) that there was no trust created in the plaintiff’s favour because the defendant had paid him for his share in the flat. But, citing ss 51(8), 51(9) and 51(10) of the HDA, the court further held (at [116]) that even if such a trust had been created by the oral agreement, the trust would be void under s 51 of the HDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It appears from [118]–[119] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Young Ching </span>that the court was partly guided by the consideration that the plaintiff owned another HDB flat, and so could not claim any interest in the flat in question by virtue of s 47(1) HDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The HDB’s letter dated 16 August 2012 to Teck Leng lays any residual doubt as to the impermissibility of the alleged nominee arrangement to rest. In its letter, the HDB expressed that were Teck Leng to transfer ownership of the Kim Tian Flat to his parents, his parents would not only have to raise the required funds to discharge the outstanding loan for the flat and pay a $40,000 resale levy, but also effect a refund to Teck Leng’s CPF account for the amount that Teck Leng had utilised towards the purchase of the flat.

</div> If the alleged nominee arrangement were permissible, the HDB’s stated requirement of effecting a refund to Teck Leng’s CPF account would be otiose, and the HDB would in effect have permitted Teck Leng to withdraw and use his CPF money as he pleased. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Under s 51(10) of the HDA, the parents cannot become entitled to the Silat Flat or the Kim Tian Flat (or any interest in those flats) under an alleged resulting trust or constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As mentioned, the parents endeavoured to characterise the purported trust as a resulting trust or a constructive trust rather than an express trust. I find that even if the alleged trust in this case was a resulting trust or a constructive trust, such a trust would fall afoul of s 51(10) of the HDA and the parents’ claim to beneficial ownership of the Kim Tian Flat would thus fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Section 51(10) of the present HDA was introduced as s 51(6) of the version of the HDA then in force in 2005 (the “2005 HDA”). In introducing the amendment, the then Minister for National Development said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 51 to make it clear that, in addition to prohibiting the voluntary creation of trusts over an HDB flat, the Act also prohibits any person from becoming entitled to a HDB flat under a resulting trust or constructive trust. This will help to prevent a situation where a person who is ineligible to own an HDB flat may become entitled to own one, for example, by paying the purchase price of the flat on behalf of the owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(15 August 2005) vol 80 at col 1259 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development), quoted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span> ([53] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [9].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Housing and Development (Amendment) Act 2005 (No 29 of 2005) then came into force on 15 September 2005, after which s 51(6) of the 2005 HDA read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) No person shall become entitled to any such flat, house or other building under any resulting trust or constructive trust, whensoever created.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It should be noted that the new subsection was described in the Ministerial Statement as an additional prohibition, on top of the prohibition already contained in ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 2005 HDA (the predecessors to the current ss 51(8) and 51(9)). The new subsection was not said to be a provision intended to relax the existing prohibitions, allowing parties to save trusts they had purportedly created in contravention of ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 2005 HDA by recasting them as resulting or constructive trusts. To the contrary, the Ministerial Statement suggests that a party could not achieve by a purchase money resulting trust, what he could not achieve by purportedly creating a trust in his favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The phrase in the Ministerial Statement that “[t]his will help to prevent a situation where a person who is ineligible to own an HDB flat may become entitled to own one …” however raises the question of whether the new subsection <span class="font-italic">only</span> applied to ineligible owners. Put another way, if a person were eligible to own an HDB flat, would s 51(6) of the 2005 HDA and s 51(10) of the HDA then not apply to prevent him becoming entitled to any such flat under a resulting trust or constructive trust?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 On the face of it, what is now s 51(10) of the HDA draws no distinction between eligible and ineligible persons, in relation to whether they can “become entitled” to an HDB flat. The language of s 51(10) of the HDA is “[n]o person shall become entitled …”, not “[n]o <span class="font-italic">ineligible</span> person shall become entitled …”. To adopt the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>([53] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [11], the latter would have been a plainer, simpler and indeed, clearer formulation had Parliament intended for s 51(10) of the HDA to apply only to ineligible persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The phrase “become entitled” has been judicially interpreted, first in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>([53] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where the court considered s 51(6) of the 2005 HDA. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>, the court cited the Ministerial Statement at [9] and then elaborated at [10]–[11]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10 It becomes clear when one has regard to [the Ministerial Statement] that Parliament’s intention was <span class="font-italic">not</span> to prevent any interest in an HDB flat arising under a resulting trust or a constructive trust regardless of the circumstances, but rather to prevent any entitlement to own an HDB flat arising in favour of a person by virtue of the law implying a resulting or constructive trust, where that person would otherwise have been ineligible to acquire such an interest. In my judgment, having regard to the mischief underlying the section, the provision was not intended to have any application where the parties concerned were already entitled to some interest in the property and therefore no issue could arise as to their eligibility to such entitlement. In such circumstances, the parties concerned would not be claiming to <span class="font-italic">become</span> entitled to own an interest in the flat by virtue of the implied trust and there would be no concern of their bypassing the eligibility criteria set by the HDB from time to time.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 This appeared to me to be the purpose of the statutory provision and it is borne out by two further points. First, the statutory enactment provides that no person shall “become entitled” to any flat under any resulting or constructive trust. This may be contrasted with a much plainer and simpler formulation such as that no person shall “be entitled to any interest in” or shall “acquire any interest in” such a flat by virtue of a constructive or resulting trust. The Ministerial Statement which used precisely the same language as is found in the statute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “become entitled”, and which then explained this by reference to the case of an ineligible person becoming entitled to own a flat through an implied trust, provides strong support for my view.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On the facts, the court concluded at [17]: “Since there was no suggestion that either party before me was ineligible or did not already have some entitlement to the flat, s 51(6) of the [2005 HDA] had no application to the case before me.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Applying the same phraseology to the present case, I would say that the parents <span class="font-italic">were</span> ineligible and that they <span class="font-italic">did not</span> already have some entitlement to the Kim Tian Flat. They were claiming to “become entitled” to the flat under the alleged resulting or constructive trust, and as such s 51(10) of the HDA applied to bar their claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>([53] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span> ([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) were all cases where the parties were registered co-owners of the flats in question, and there was no issue as to their eligibility either. They were not claiming to “become entitled” to the flats (or any interest in them) by a resulting or constructive trust – they already had such an entitlement. Moreover, there was no intention to circumvent any HDB regulation or policy, and the court was simply asked to determine the parties’ beneficial interests in the properties. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span> observed at [14], if parties wish to hold a property in certain proportions, they can arrange to do so as tenants in common, and that would not be objectionable to the HDB; for the court to declare the proportions in which legal joint tenants hold their beneficial interests would likewise not offend the HDA or HDB policy. None of those cases concerned nominee ownership, whereas the parents’ purported ownership of the Silat Flat and the Kim Tian Flat was not known to the HDB: they were not registered owners, and indeed whatever interests they claimed to have were hidden from the HDB. Had the parents arranged to hold their legal interests in the same manner that they argued their beneficial interests were held, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 100% to the parents and 0% to Teck Leng, two consequences would have ensued – they would have had to pay the HDB a $40,000 resale levy, and they would not have gotten a housing loan from the HDB. That illustrates the mischief of the nominee ownership contended for here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The parents were not already entitled to the Silat Flat or the Kim Tian Flat independent of the trust that they alleged. Their own case was that they had “become entitled” to those flats under the alleged trust, and the prohibition in s 51(10) of the HDA accordingly bites.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The prohibition in s 51(10) of the<span class="font-italic"> </span>HDA does not merely apply to bar otherwise ineligible owners from becoming entitled to an HDB flat (or an interest in it) under a resulting trust or a constructive trust. In any event, I find that the parents were not “eligible” to purchase the Silat Flat or the Kim Tian Flat (a) without paying a $40,000 resale levy, and (b) with the benefit of an HDB housing loan (which they were not eligible for). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Section 51(10) of the HDA does not allow persons to become entitled to an HDB flat (or an interest in it) in circumvention of HDB regulation or policy. It would defeat the legislative purpose of s 51(10) of the HDA to interpret that provision as allowing nominee ownership in a case like the present.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When can and should the court impose a constructive trust?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In this action, the parents assert a constructive trust – specifically, a common intention constructive trust. A common intention constructive trust is an institutional constructive trust arising out of the operation of law from the facts, and not as the result of the exercise of judicial discretion (unlike a remedial constructive trust): see <span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span><span class="font-italic"> Paramesvaeri v Fleury, Jeffrey Gerard and another </span>[2016] 5 SLR 302 at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The nature of a constructive trust was also explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [17]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The nature of a constructive trust is such that it could not be said to be ‘created’ by the parties. It is a trust which is <span class="font-italic">imposed</span> by equity in respect of an interest in a property in a variety of circumstances which would render it inequitable for the owner of the property or any interest therein to hold it for his benefit. It arises independently of the intention of the parties. A resulting trust, however, is different. It arises from a certain transaction carried out intentionally by the parties concerned and the court infers an intention to create a trust in favour of a party. …  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 At [16]–[17] of <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span>([48] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal considered the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Soon v Phua Sin Yin</span> [1995] 2 SLRI 583 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Soon</span>”), where the court had held (at [15]) that the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “1985 HDA”) “does not nullify the power of the court under s 56 or s 106 of the Women’s Charter to declare an interest in an HDB flat whether in the nature of a trust or otherwise for such trust is not created by the owner. It is decreed by the court under a statutory power.” The court in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Soon</span> was considering the predecessors to ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the present HDA, which were found in ss 51(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 51(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 HDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It is also noteworthy that the predecessor to those subsections, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 44(4) of the original HDA (as set out in [18] of <span class="font-italic">Cheong</span>) read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Every trust or alleged trust, whether the trust is express, implied or constructive, which purports to be created in respect of any such flat, house or other building by the owner thereof shall be null and void and shall be incapable of being enforced by any court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There, Parliament had grouped express, implied and constructive trusts together as trusts which might purport to be created by parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng v Ho Yee Fong </span>[2011] 3 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh</span>”) at [56], the addition of the words “or arising” in s 51(10) of the current HDA only clarifies that a resulting trust or a constructive trust may be more properly said to arise by operation of law, rather than by the creation of parties.

</div> This, coupled with the parents’ admission that the Silat Flat and the Kim Tian Flat were registered in Teck Leng’s sole name so that (<span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>) he could take an HDB housing loan (which was serviced from his CPF account), gives rise to a strong inference that the understanding between Teck Leng and his parents was always that <span class="font-italic">he</span> would repay the HDB housing loan.  Consequently, the mortgage payments count as <span class="font-italic">Teck </span><span class="font-italic">Leng’s </span>contribution and not his parents’: see <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel</span>”) at [87]–[90]. It also bears emphasising that, according to the parents, one of the two reasons why the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat were in Teck Leng’s name was that he could get an HDB housing loan (which the parents were then not eligible for). But this fatally contradicts the foundation of their alleged understanding, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was to pay for the flats in full from the money they gave him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 One might also ask why a loan was contemplated if, as the parents say, the sale proceeds from their CCK Flat were expected to be enough to fully pay for the Silat Flat.

</div> Why not just purchase the Silat Flat in the parents’ joint names and pay for it with the CCK Flat proceeds (which were expected to be enough, and were in fact enough)? The other reason that the parents proffered – to evade payment of a $40,000 resale levy to the HDB – does not explain why Teck Leng might take a loan rather than use his parents’ money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The answer may lie in what Teck Leng and his parents alluded to about his <span class="font-italic">investing</span> their money. In his first affidavit, Teck Leng stated: “The monies from my parents was [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] sufficient to pay for the Kim Tian Road flat but I took a loan as it made more economic sense. I enjoy a low interest rate from HDB and get free cash to invest and spend.”

</div> If all Teck Leng was expected to do was to pay off the Silat Flat using the CCK Flat proceeds, and thereafter pay off the Kim Tian Flat using the Silat Flat proceeds and his parents’ life savings (all of which he was to keep intact), his “experience in the finance sector as an accountant” would have been irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The picture which emerges is that both Teck Leng and his parents intended that he could take an HDB housing loan so as to have free cash “to invest for higher returns”.

It could only be Teck Leng’s. The parents never took the position that Teck Leng’s housing loan was their responsibility. And if Teck Leng was investing his parents’ money, while taking a loan and paying it off with his CPF money, it would amount to double counting to say that the parents were entitled to the investments that Teck Leng made with their money, <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> the Kim Tian Flat which was financed by a loan that he was using his CPF money towards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Given the family’s supposed concern about the parents’ inability to pay for the Kim Tian Flat,

</div> one would expect the parents to want the Kim Tian Flat to be paid up using their money, rather than for Teck Leng to take a loan and invest the parents’ money instead.

</div> If the money was entrusted to Teck Leng for investment, then any gains or losses would be on the parents’ account. If there were losses, then the original principal amount would no longer be fully available to pay for the Kim Tian Flat. The parents cannot say, on the one hand, that they wanted Teck Leng to invest their money; but, on the other hand, that losses from such investments do not count, and that they should still be regarded as having paid for the flats (simply because the original principal sum they had given to Teck Leng was enough).

It did not mean that $150,000 was paid in cash for the Kim Tian Flat. Moreover, the documents show that <span class="font-italic">nothing</span> was paid in cash to acquire the Kim Tian Flat – the Kim Tian Flat was paid for by the SERS contra from the Silat Flat, money from Teck Leng’s CPF account, and an HDB housing loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The parents nevertheless contended that because there was an understanding between them and Teck Leng that they owned the Kim Tian Flat, I should find (contrary to the Ancillary Order) that the Kim Tian Flat is not a matrimonial asset at all, but instead wholly owned by them. The parents also relied on an unsigned “will” of Teck Leng’s, and Teck Leng’s correspondence with the HDB, to support this alleged understanding.

Yet in the same breath, the parents acknowledged that Teck Leng could take an HDB housing loan, use his CPF account to service the loan and invest the “free cash” from them. Indeed, one of the reasons for the Silat Flat and Kim Tian Flat being in Teck Leng’s name was so that he could take an HDB housing loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 But did Teck Leng’s parents give him the money as a gift, or as a loan from them, or was he entrusted with the money (such that the parents intended to retain the beneficial interest in the money, and to have an interest in what it might be invested in)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 It is implausible that the money was a gift by Teck Leng’s parents to him. The money comprised the proceeds of the CCK Flat (which was the parents’ matrimonial flat and apparently their main asset) and what was said to be their life savings. Moreover, it is unthinkable that the parents would make such a generous gift to Teck Leng (and him only) when they had two other children, particularly in light of the parents’ professed lack of favouritism towards any of their children

</div> <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before any discussion about selling the CCK Flat and purchasing the Silat Flat (for which the Kim Tian Flat would then be offered as a replacement) had taken place (see [26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 That sum of $67,000 was thus not given “for [Teck Leng] to put into the replacement flat at Kim Tian Road”. At best, it had been given to Teck Leng to invest on the parents’ behalf, without any reference to any potential purchases of HDB flats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Aside from the pocketbook, there is no documentary evidence to support the parents’ assertion of how much of their “life savings” they gave to Teck Leng; nor is there any documentary evidence to show what Teck Leng did with the money. Teck Leng said that he had invested in shares and lost money as a result, but he did not state how much he had invested or lost.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 On the evidence, it does appear that Teck Leng received at least the amount of the CCK Flat proceeds, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $217,654.72. Honghong understood that he had taken some $300,000 from his parents following the sale of the CCK Flat; his parents said that they gave him $332,626.08 ($217,654.72 in CCK Flat proceeds + $114,971.36 in their “life savings”). But the crucial question remains: was there an understanding that the parents would be regarded as the owners of the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 One of the reasons the parents gave for the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat being purchased in Teck Leng’s name was the $40,000 resale levy which the parents would otherwise have had to pay. Registering Teck Leng as the legal owner while the parents were the beneficial owners would allow the parents to evade payment of the levy. If, however, Teck Leng were both the legal and beneficial owner of the flats, there would be no evasion of payment: as a first-time buyer, Teck Leng was not subject to the levy. Could the parents have actually intended that Teck Leng would be the legal <span class="font-italic">and</span> beneficial owner of the flats? If so, the money that they gave him would be in the nature of a gift or loan, rather than money entrusted to him to buy the flats for them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Similarly, when Teck Leng took a loan from the HDB, which he was entitled to but his parents were not, was the HDB being misled as to who the real owner was? Or was Teck Leng really the owner?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 As I mentioned at [124] above, it appears that the parents were minded for Teck Leng to invest their money and take an HDB loan (which would be serviced from his CPF account), rather than to tie up their money in the flats. The money was not given to him for the “sole purpose of purchasing the Silat Flat or any other property for us (i.e. us, [Teck Leng], and our children) to stay in”, as the parents claimed in their second joint affidavit in relation to the CCK Flat proceeds.

</div> Teck Leng could well have decided not to use any of his parents’ money for the Silat Flat purchase, but instead to use his CPF money and an HDB housing loan (as he did with the Kim Tian Flat, in addition to the SERS contra). If so, the parents would not have contributed at all towards the Silat Flat, and that would undermine any understanding that they be regarded as its owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 I now turn to the matter of Teck Leng’s unsigned “will”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Teck Leng’s unsigned “will” does not support the alleged understanding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The parents relied on an unsigned “will” dated 19 October 2010 which they claimed Teck Leng had made just after his marriage to Honghong, while Teck Leng, his parents and his siblings were living at the Silat Flat.

</div> The unsigned “will” stated that upon Teck Leng’s death, the Silat Flat would go to Mr Lim and Mrs Lim in a 45:55 ratio. The unsigned “will” went on to state that certain commemorative coins sets would be left to Honghong, and that the rest of Teck Leng’s property would be distributed as such: 20% to Honghong; 28% to Mrs Lim; 22% to Mr Lim; 18% to Teck Leng’s brother; and 12% to Teck Leng’s sister.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The parents’ argument appeared to be: since Teck Leng had intended for the Silat Flat to go to them both upon his death, the common intention was thereby for them to also own it fully while he was alive.

</div>
</div> I found that the unsigned “will” did not support the parents’ contention; instead, it pointed to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 If the will that Teck Leng had deposited with the Wills Registry is in the same terms as the unsigned “will” that the parents relied on, the will would only take effect upon his death. A will is not an immediate gift of property, whether by trust or otherwise. Nor is a will a recognition that all of the beneficiaries are already the owners of the property that they are to receive upon the testator’s death. By including the Silat Flat in a will, Teck Leng was acting as its owner. If he had regarded himself as merely a nominee, the Silat Flat was not his to give away. Instead, it was for his parents to assert their alleged 100% beneficial ownership if he should pass away, or indeed, at any time – like they did in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The fact that the unsigned “will” has a 45:55 split of the Silat Flat as between Mr Lim and Mrs Lim is also curious. It goes against the parents’ Originating Summons, first joint affidavit, and submissions: all of which were to the effect that they should be regarded as <span class="font-italic">jointly </span>holding their interest in the Kim Tian Flat. The Originating Summons simply asked for “[a] declaration that the 1st and 2nd [p]laintiffs are the beneficial owners of the [Kim Tian Flat]”, and no particular proportions of their respective interests were advanced in their first joint affidavit. In their second joint affidavit, however, they referred to the unsigned “will” and contended that the beneficial interest in the Kim Tian Flat was held under a common intention constructive trust in the proportion as stated in the unsigned “will”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 45% to Mr Lim and 55% to Mrs Lim.

</div> No explanation was offered as to why the alleged common intention was for a holding in those particular proportions, and no evidence was provided that they had contributed in those proportions. The contention in their second joint affidavit for this specific common intention was then abandoned, and indeed contradicted, in their written submissions, which stated: “It is also important to note that the [parents’] case is also predicated on their beneficial interests in the [Kim Tian Flat] to be found jointly, as they were joint tenants in the CCK Flat and there was no formal severance of their interests.”

</div>
</div>, the HDB indicated that it had had a discussion with Teck Leng on 25 June 2012 on the various options available to him. Following that discussion, Teck Leng had conveyed to the HDB his wish to transfer the ownership of the Kim Tian Flat to his parents outright so that he and Honghong could move out and buy another flat directly. The HDB informed him that approval for such a course of action would have to be obtained from its management. In its reply, the HDB also stated: “… as your parents are not working, they are not eligible to obtain a housing loan from HDB to take over the ownership of the flat. We have clarified that your parents would need to raise the required funds to discharge the outstanding loan for the flat, effect refund to your CPF account for the amount utilized by you for the purchase of the flat and the $40,000 resale levy which your parents are liable to settle. Additionally, there will be legal and stamp fees payable to effect the change in the flat ownership.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 The HDB’s letter of 16 August 2012 confirms that the parents could not have purchased the Kim Tian Flat in their own names (a) without paying a $40,000 resale levy, and (b) with an HDB housing loan (which they were then not eligible for).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 After the HDB’s letter of 16 August 2012, Teck Leng did not follow up to get the transfer approved by the HDB’s management or effected in the manner described by the HDB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Throughout all of this correspondence, Teck Leng never told the HDB, the Minister/Ministry of National Development, or his MP that he was merely a nominee and that his parents were the beneficial owners of the Kim Tian Flat: instead, he called it “<span class="font-italic">my</span> replacement flat”

Teck Leng and his parents would now have the court believe that through it all, Teck Leng lied to everyone and that his parents were complicit in their joint endeavour: to evade payment of the resale levy, and to facilitate Teck Leng’s obtaining an HDB housing loan that the parents themselves were not eligible for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In any event, Teck Leng’s radio silence as to his parents’ purported beneficial ownership of the Kim Tian Flat, in his correspondence with the HDB, speaks for itself. It could mean one of two things: either that there was never a nominee arrangement and so Teck Leng was both the legal and beneficial owner of the Kim Tian Flat; or that Teck Leng was well aware that such a nominee arrangement offended the HDA and thus his reluctance to inform the HDB of the same. Either of these scenarios leads to the inevitable conclusion that the parents’ claim must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 On her part, Honghong wrote to the Minister on 21 February 2012 to ask if the couple’s names could be separated from the parents’ names, and if the parents could buy or rent another apartment.

</div> As I mentioned earlier, neither Teck Leng nor his parents told Honghong that the Kim Tian Flat actually belonged to the parents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the alleged understanding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I find that there was no understanding that the parents were the beneficial owners of the Kim Tian Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 First and foremost, the foundation of that understanding – that Teck Leng was to fully pay for the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat using his parents’ money – is contradicted by the parents’ own position that he could take an HDB housing loan to pay for the flats and invest their money instead. Indeed, one of the two reasons advanced for those flats being in Teck Leng’s name was so that he could take such a loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 My conclusion is reinforced by: the position which Teck Leng took in the FJC proceedings up to the making of the Ancillary Order; how he regarded the Silat Flat as his to deal with in his unsigned “will” (as well as his apparent allocation of unequal proportions of the Silat Flat to the parents therein); what he told the HDB, the Minister/Ministry of National Development, and his MP; and Honghong’s being unaware of any such understanding. Moreover, on the parents’ own case, they had started giving Teck Leng money in 2006, before there was any discussion about any potential purchases of further HDB flats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Teck Leng’s position only changed after the Ancillary Order had been made, when Honghong applied for an order that the Kim Tian Flat be sold. The sea change came with his affidavit in the FJC proceedings dated 8 April 2019. There, he claimed that he did not make any financial contributions whatsoever to the purchase of the Kim Tian Flat,

Thus, when he purchased the Silat Flat and then the Kim Tian Flat in his own name, he was the legal <span class="font-italic">and beneficial</span> owner of those flats. The HDB was not misled as to who the real owner was. When the HDB extended a loan to Teck Leng for the Kim Tian Flat, again, the HDB was not misled as to who the real owner was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In the FJC proceedings, when Honghong described the Kim Tian Flat a matrimonial asset and sought its division, Teck Leng went along with that – he agreed that the flat <span class="font-italic">was</span> a matrimonial asset susceptible to division, and he claimed credit for his contributions to the flat (including any money he had received from his parents and used to pay towards the flat). It is incredible that Teck Leng would have remained silent about his parents being the beneficial owners of the Kim Tian Flat, and about their contributions to the purchase of the flat, if there had really been the alleged understanding. This is particularly so given that Teck Leng appeared to have been alive to the possibility of Honghong seeking a sale of the Kim Tian Flat – in his own words, she “[sought] to deprive [his] elderly parents of their home”.

Equitable accounting is a process where the court endeavours to do “broad justice or equity as between co-owners” (<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel </span>at [95]), but the parents were not co-owners with Teck Leng. I have found that the understanding between them was that of a loan by the parents to Teck Leng, which Teck Leng could use to invest in shares, or to buy HDB flats that he would be the owner of, or indeed to spend on the family. If the parents have recourse against Teck Leng, it is for repayment of that loan, not by way of equitable accounting.

In such a case, because no order is sought by or against the third party, it is permissible for the court to make an order exercising its powers under s 112 because the only parties directly affected by the order will be the parting spouses. This, again, is an Option 1 course. The choice of Option 1 would have the same risks for the spouses as alluded to in [57] above. Thus, for instance, the spouse in whose name the property stands, having been ordered to share the value of the property with the other spouse, may later find he or she has to account to the third party for such value or to transfer the property outright to the third party. This is because the determination of the ownership of the disputed property in the s 112 proceedings will not bind the third party who may challenge it in separate proceedings. But that is the risk the spouse takes by not seeking an order that will bind the third party. Once such an order is sought, in our view, this would be the same situation as discussed in [56(b)] above and a separate set of proceedings would have to be issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Teck Leng chose simply to resist the making of the Sale Order, and failed.

</div> I found this hard to believe given that the Kim Tian Flat was in Teck Leng’s sole name, and moreover, that the parents were staying there with him. Although they claimed that he was holding the Kim Tian Flat on trust for them, that was entirely undocumented, and they must have realised that there was a risk of the flat being regarded as a matrimonial asset. Instead, they claimed that they were only informed by Teck Leng in June 2019 that the Sale Order had been made,

</div> and that prompted them to commence these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 I also noted Honghong’s remarks in her 24 May 2017 affidavit filed in the FJC proceedings that the parents had accompanied Teck Leng to the ancillary matters hearing on 24 April 2017, although they were then not allowed to attend the hearing.

</div> This casts serious doubt on the parents’ claim to have been in the dark as to the inclusion of the Kim Tian Flat in the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">UDA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([153] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54]: “A third party claiming an interest in any property alleged to be a matrimonial asset is entitled to have his rights ruled on by the court and is, further, entitled to the benefit of a final ruling which he can assert against the rest of the world.” The Court of Appeal elaborated at [58]: “… the determination of the ownership of the disputed property in the s 112 proceedings will not bind the third party who may challenge it in separate proceedings”. However, if the third party <span class="font-italic">knows</span> that determination of the ownership of the disputed property is underway in the FJC proceedings, but willfully chooses to wait until after an adverse decision has been rendered by the FJC, before commencing proceedings seeking the opposite outcome, he may have to confront the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>/defence of abuse of process – see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [19]–[24] and <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [98] and [104].

The court seeks to help the parties “let go” and “move on’”. But the parties must play their part. When the fighting stops, healing can begin (see the Court of Appeal’s note on the importance of Therapeutic Justice in <span class="font-italic">VDZ v VEA</span> [2020] SGCA 75 at [75]–[79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 This sad saga has already seen both Honghong and Teck Leng serving jail terms for offences of harassment against the District Judge; Teck Leng’s repeated incarceration for non-compliance with the Ancillary Order; maintenance for the children remaining in arrears; and Teck Leng’s parents becoming litigants in this failed attempt to claim Teck Leng’s Kim Tian Flat for themselves (and to thus keep the flat from being sold pursuant to the Sale Order in order to satisfy the Ancillary Order). There are still pending applications in the FJC. My hope is that the parties will be able to resolve their remaining differences sooner rather than later, and finally move on with their lives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I dismiss this action and will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Abdul Rahman bin Mohd Hanipah, Mohammad Shafiq bin Haja Maideen and Syafiqah binte Ahmad Fu’ad (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lai Ying Ling Jenny (Jenny Lai &amp; Co) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Yu Wen Amelia and Lee Kai Lin Kelyn (Lee &amp; Lee) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
