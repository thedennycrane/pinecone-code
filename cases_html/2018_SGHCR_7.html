DeClout Ltd (“the 2nd Defendant”), Eradite International Pte Ltd (“the 3rd Defendant”) and the 1st Defendant were shareholders of Acclivis until 22 November 2016, when they disposed of the entire shareholding to CITIC Consultancy 1616 Ltd (“CITIC”). Mr Wong Kok Khun (“the 4th Defendant”) is the Chairman and Group Chief Executive of the 2nd Defendant, while Mr Nah Nah Guan (“the 5th Defendant”) is a director of the 3rd Defendant. The present application (“the Application”) is taken out by the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant only.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The parties have different accounts of some of the key background facts.

Mr Amos is the 2nd Defendant in the Counterclaim. The 1st Defendant and Mr Amos had developed a close friendship, and had explored possible business opportunities together. The 1st Defendant had the impression that Mr Amos was the Plaintiff’s owner, decision-maker and alter-ego. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Sometime in September 2015, Acclivis required funds to proceed with a business transaction. The 1st Defendant approached Mr Amos and informed him that they could invest by way of subscription of new shares in Acclivis.

Pursuant to the Understanding, the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff agreed to co-invest in 2,787,516 shares of Acclivis (“Trust Shares”). Some of the other salient terms of the Understanding include: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff would contribute payment of $3,602,200 towards the acquisition of the Trust Shares. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 1st Defendant would be the 100% legal owner of the Trust Shares, while the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant would each retain 50% beneficial interest in the shares. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Upon disposal of the Trust Shares, the net profit earned from the disposal would be divided between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant in equal shares, “after the initial contribution of S$3,602,200 is returned to the Plaintiff”.

By way of background, Ms Chong is a solicitor who, according to the 1st Defendant, had acted for him by way of an “implied retainer” in relation to negotiations concerning a shareholders’ agreement with the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Mr Amos and Ms Chong met the 1st Defendant that night at the car park of his residence, and requested him to sign a trust deed (“the Trust Deed”). The 1st Defendant did so, in reliance on Ms Chong’s representation that this was so as to formalise the Understanding. In his Defence &amp; Counterclaim, the 1st Defendant has averred, amongst other things, that he had not been given an opportunity to review the Trust Deed before signing it, that the legal effect of the Trust Deed had not been explained to him, and that Ms Chong had not advised him of his option to seek independent legal advice. As such, he intended to dispute the validity and contents of the Trust Deed at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the lead up to the sale of Acclivis, the 1st Defendant informed the Plaintiff that there were debts amounting to $6,493,355.43 owed to Acclivis by certain third party entities (“the Bad Debts”), and that these proved an obstacle to the sale of Acclivis. These Bad Debts were owed by entities that had been introduced to Acclivis by the Plaintiff, through Mr Amos. As such, sometime in May 2016, the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff entered into an agreement (“the Bad Debts Agreement”) for the Plaintiff to make repayment of the Bad Debts out of the Plaintiff’s portion of the sale proceeds from the sale of the Trust Shares (“the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds”) in the event that the Bad Debts were not paid by the time Acclivis was sold.

</div>
</div> Elaborating on this point, Mr Wong argued that there was a significant distinction between “equitable compensation” and common law “damages” – in particular, the latter is not available as a remedy for an equitable wrong (citing <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management</span>”) at [32]). This was a “distinction with a difference” and one “of substance”, rather than mere semantics, given that it reflected the different starting points of common law and equity, and the very different purposes between the award of damages and equitable compensation (citing <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span><span class="font-italic"> Management </span>at [37]–[41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Low Chai Chong (“Mr Low”), contended that O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court were to be considered holistically and ought not to be taken as mutually exclusive. Citing the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and another v Maclaine Watson &amp; Co Ltd and others </span>[1987] 1 WLR 480 (“<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers</span>”), he argued that the court should simply ask the <span class="font-italic">single question</span> of whether the Application fulfilled the requirements of O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court read <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>, rather than considering separately and exclusively an applicant’s entitlement under each rule.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Supplemental Written Submissions (15 March 2018), at paragraphs 4 and 5. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On the basis of <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers</span>, Mr Low submitted that there was no need to determine precisely which sub-paragraph of O 29 rr 11(1) and 12 of the Rules of Court the Application was premised upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mr Low further contended that, in any event, equitable compensation fell within the meaning of “damages”, as may be seen from two Court of Appeal decisions (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 at [43] (“… equitable compensation is a claim for damages for breach of a fiduciary duty…”); and <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal</span> [2016] 5 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>”) at [14] (“… ‘damages’ is strictly speaking mere shorthand for equitable compensation…”)). Mr Low thus argued that it was entirely permissible for the Plaintiff to seek interim payment for equitable compensation under O 29 r 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision on the First Stage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I begin first by considering Mr Low’s proposition that there was no need to specify the sub-paragraphs upon which interim payment is sought, and that the court should simply ask the single question of whether the Application fulfilled the requirements of O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court read as a whole. Mr Low relied on <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers</span> for this proposition. <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>is of persuasive value in interpreting O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court, particularly in the light that those rules are <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with the English rules that the English Court of Appeal had considered. However, I do not think that the decision supports Mr Low’s proposition in the context of the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers</span>, the applicants agreed to sell large quantities of tin to the respondents under standard forms of contract incorporating the rules and regulations of the London Metal Exchange. Before delivery took place, dealings on the tin market were suspended, and when the applicants tried to deliver the tin, the respondents refused to accept it. The committee of the London Metal Exchange subsequently promulgated “Rule M”, fixing a settlement price for all tin contracts affected by suspension. The respondents admitted that they would have been liable to pay £7.2 million if the applicants were willing to accept the validity of “Rule M”. However, the applicants had denied the validity of “Rule M”, and claimed the full contract price of £23.9 million, or alternatively, a minimum of £7.2 million as damages for non-acceptance. The applicants sought interim payment, relying on their alternative claim for non-acceptance at a minimum figure of £7.2 million. The respondents took the position that if they were liable to pay damages, these would not exceed £5.2 million. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 At first instance, the High Court Judge found that the applicants would recover either £5.2 million (as “damages” for non-acceptance) or £7.2 million (under “Rule M”, which would be a sum of money “apart from any damages”). In determining whether interim payment ought to be ordered, the learned Judge considered two questions: first, whether the applicants would recover damages for non-acceptance – the learned Judge answered “no”, because answering “yes” would pre-judge the central question at trial in relation to the validity of “Rule M”; and second, whether the applicants would recover the “Rule M” difference (<span class="font-italic">viz, </span>£7.2 million) – the learned Judge again answered “no”, because this would also pre-judge the central question. The learned Judge therefore declined to order interim payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On appeal, the English Court of Appeal, through three separate judgments (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lloyd LJ, Nicholls LJ and Sir John Megaw), reversed the decision and came to the unified conclusion that the applicants should be granted interim payment of £5.2 million in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Lloyd LJ found that the High Court Judge should have asked himself the <span class="font-italic">single question</span> of whether the applicants would recover either<span class="font-italic"> </span>damages for non-acceptance, or<span class="font-italic"> </span>the “Rule M” difference; had this single question been asked, the answer would clearly have been “yes”. While O 29 rr 11(1) and 12 of the Rules of Court were separate rules, the learned Lord Justice opined that to read these rules separately on the facts would produce a result which was “so obviously unsatisfactory that one is driven to look for another solution” (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 486G). The learned Lord Justice therefore held that O 29 rr 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court ought to be read together in the circumstances, and suggested a possible combined reading as follows (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 487A–B):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If, on the hearing of an application under rule 10 in an action for damages the court is satisfied that … the plaintiff would obtain judgment for substantial damages … or that … the plaintiff would obtain judgment … for a substantial sum of money apart from damages … the court may, if it thinks fit, and without prejudice to any contentions of the parties as to the nature or character of the sum to be paid by the defendant, order the defendant to make an interim payment …..</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Nicholls LJ judgment proceeded along similar lines. The learned Lord Justice observed that it would be “repugnant to commonsense and contrary to the purposes of the interim payments code in Order 29” that, by adding a claim for damages, the applicants thereby lost their entitlement to interim payment that they would otherwise have had under O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 193H). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Sir John Megaw agreed with Lloyd and Nicholls LJJ, and opined that insofar as the court was satisfied that there would be judgment for a substantial sum under either O 29 rr 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) or 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court, it did not have to be concerned about whether the sum could technically be classified as “damages” or otherwise (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 494–495). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>does not provide support for Mr Low’s proposition that there is no need to identify the precise ground upon which the Application was premised. The English Court of Appeal was concerned with a situation where the court was satisfied that the applicant would recover <span class="font-italic">either </span>damages <span class="font-italic">or</span> a sum of money apart from damages. It was in those circumstances that the English Court of Appeal held that the dichotomy between O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court ought not to be interpreted literally so as to deny the applicants the interim payment simply because it was not possible to tell, at the interlocutory stage, whether the sum claimed would be in the nature of damages or otherwise. The present case is quite different. Here, there is no alternative legal basis for the Plaintiff’s claim for $3,602,200 – both counsel proceeded on the basis that the sum was in the nature of equitable compensation. The sole question was whether equitable compensation fell within “damages” for the purposes of O 29 r 11(1) of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In this regard, I acknowledge that both counsel have cited authorities in support of their respective interpretations of whether “equitable compensation” is a form of “damages”; but it ought to be noted that none of the authorities cited concerned the use of the word “damages” specifically in the context of O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court. I do note the force in Mr Wong’s point that equating “damages” with “equitable compensation” would render nugatory the apparent dichotomy between O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court, and that a court would ordinarily be cautious about adopting an interpretation that would have the effect of rendering rules otiose; but as against this argument, it bears noting that O 29 rr 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court have in fact been judicially criticised for being “difficult and obscure” in “various respects”, with the English Court of Appeal going so far as to suggest that the dichotomy ought not to have existed in the first place (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 494B–C). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is ultimately unnecessary for me to determine whether a claim for equitable compensation can be brought under O 29 r 11(1) of the Rules of Court. Nothing significant turns on this point in the present case, for two reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, regardless of whether a claim for equitable compensation can be brought under O 29 r 11(1) of the Rules of Court, the 1st Defendant’s alleged admission remains relevant in determining whether the First Stage is established. Of course, if the issue is answered positively, the 1st Defendant’s alleged admission may constitute a standalone ground in O 29 r 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court. However, the same admission remains relevant under the broader grounds in O 29 rr 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court, as it would go towards finding that the Plaintiff would obtain judgment for “substantial damages” or “a substantial sum of money apart from any damages or costs”. Nothing precludes the Plaintiff from relying on an admission under those other rules, and the Plaintiff has in fact indicated that it is proceeding under those other rules in the alternative (see [22] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the tail end of O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court contains a broad provision stating that it is “without prejudice to any contentions of the parties as to the nature or character of the sum to be paid by the defendant”. As Sir John Megaw observed, this phrase must mean that the court need not trouble itself, in a claim under O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court, with the issue of the technical legal classification of the “sum to be paid” thereunder (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 494F). This provides further comfort and justification for assessing the Application under O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the circumstances, I proceed to assess if the requirements of O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court are met in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether requirements of O 29 r 12(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">met</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Under O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules of Court, the Plaintiff has to demonstrate that if the action proceeds to trial, it would obtain judgment against the 1st Defendant for a substantial sum of money. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Mr Low’s primary argument is that the 1st Defendant had <span class="font-italic">admitted</span> that the Plaintiff had paid $3,602,200 for subscription of the Trust Shares, and that the 1st Defendant had <span class="font-italic">admitted </span>that the sum had to be returned to the Plaintiff.

[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Based on these paragraphs, Mr Low argued that the present case “is on all fours” with the facts in <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (</span><span class="font-italic">HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (</span><span class="font-italic">CA)</span>. In that case, an insurer discovered that it had made a mistake in valuing certain funds, and therefore brought an action against the policyholders for unjust enrichment and conspiracy, alleging that they had knowingly exploited the mistake to their advantage. The policyholders applied for interim payment of the invested capital. In opposing the interim payment application, the insurer did not argue that the policyholders were not entitled to the return of their capital investment; rather, its case was that (a) there might be no capital to be returned in the light of the insurer’s counterclaim for damages for conspiracy which should be set-off against the capital investment; and (b) the capital investment was not guaranteed and as such its quantum at the time of the set-off was indeterminate. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that refusing to order interim payment would effectively be giving the insurer a security for its counterclaims, and would be analogous to granting the insurer a Mareva injunction to meet its counterclaims (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (CA) </span>at [28]). On the facts, as the insurer had failed to show <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>that the amount it was likely to recover would exceed the policyholders’ investments, the Court of Appeal found it proper and reasonable to exercise discretion to order a prudent amount of interim payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Mr Wong maintained that the cited paragraphs had to be understood in the proper context, and that upon a holistic appreciation of the Defence &amp; Counterclaim, the 1st Defendant had not in fact made any admission at all. To this end, the 1st Defendant’s understanding of the mechanics on the apportionment of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds is as follows:

The Plaintiff has claimed that Sum X is $18,365,565.75, whereas the 1st Defendant has taken the position that Sum X is $8,728,737.75 (see [14(d)] above). If the 1st Defendant’s version is accepted, the Plaintiff’s share of Sum X (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, what the 1st Defendant referred to as<span class="font-italic"> </span>“Sum Y”) would be $6,165,468.88. However, the Bad Debts Agreement must also be taken into account, and if so, a Sum Y of $6,165,468.88 would be insufficient to pay off the Bad Debts, which amount to $6,493,355.43 (see [9] above). In other words, it is not presently possible to determine whether Sum Y is larger or smaller than the Bad Debts. The exact amounts of Sums X and Y remain to be adjudicated at trial. If it transpires that Sum Y is larger than the Bad Debts, then the court may order the 1st Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the excess money; but if Sum Y is smaller than the Bad Debts, then Sum Y could be extinguished by the Bad Debts and the result would be that the 1st Defendant would not be liable to pay the Plaintiff any money.

In this regard, the 1st Defendant’s claim in relation to the Bad Debts Agreement was a mere counterclaim that did not amount to a set-off, and therefore should be disregarded for the purposes of the First Stage. To elaborate: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) There was no <span class="font-italic">legal set-off</span> because: (A) the debts allegedly owed under the Bad Debts Agreement were not due and payable; (B) the total amount of the Plaintiff’s share of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds is presently indeterminate in view of the Side Letter; (C) the Plaintiff’s proprietary claim for the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds cannot be set off against a monetary claim for a debt owing under the Bad Debts Agreement (citing <span class="font-italic">Blue Sky One Ltd v Mahan Air </span>[2010] EWHC 631 at [118]); and (D) the Bad Debts were owed by third parties instead of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) There was also no <span class="font-italic">equitable set-off</span>, because only cross-claims which were so closely connected to the main claim that it would be manifestly unjust to allow a claimant to enforce a payment without taking into account the cross-claim would qualify as an equitable set-off (citing <span class="font-italic">Pacific Rim Investments Pte LTd v Lam Seng Tiong </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 643 at [35]–[37]). In this regard, the Bad Debts Agreement was an entirely different transaction from the Understanding or the Trust Deed. Furthermore, they served different purposes – the Trust Deed and Understanding governed the Plaintiff’s interest in the Trust Shares, whereas the Bad Debts Agreement governed payments owed by third parties to Acclivis. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, in any event, the Plaintiff has denied the existence of the Bad Debts Agreement, and the 1st Defendant’s claim in relation to the Bad Debts Agreement was “simply unsustainable” for four reasons:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Reply to 1st Defendant’s Defence (19 September 2017), at paragraph 22.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> To date, the 1st Defendant had produced “absolutely no evidence” to support the existence of the Bad Debts Agreement, even after general discovery had been completed.  While the 1st Defendant claimed that the Bad Debts Agreement was entered into “in or around May 2016” both “orally and in writing” via “numerous conversations” and “Whatsapp messages exchanged”, none of the Whatsapp messages bore this out. Furthermore, as late as 31 May 2016, the 1st Defendant was still requesting Mr Amos to “press” one of the entities liable for the Bad Debts; had the Bad Debts Agreement been in place, the 1st Defendant would not have been making such requests. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, the Bad Debts Agreement, as pleaded, was unsustainable in law because the 1st Defendant had failed to plead any consideration for the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Third, the terms of the Bad Debts Agreement were unclear – in particular, it was uncertain whether the Plaintiff’s share of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds to be applied to the Bad Debts included the sum of $3,602,200.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Fourth, the existence of the Bad Debts Agreement was contradicted by the 1st Defendant’s subsequent conduct. In particular, the 1st Defendant had already received an assignment of the Bad Debt receivables under the SLA, and had obtained judgment against one of the three entities liable for the Bad Debts. If the Plaintiff truly bore liability for the Bad Debts, the receivables ought to have been assigned to the Plaintiff instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Mr Wong argued that the 1st Defendant’s pleading in relation to the Bad Debts Agreement formed part of his <span class="font-italic">primary defence</span>, separately and distinctly from any set-off or counterclaim.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  1st Defendant’s Supplementary Written Submissions (19 March 2018) at paragraph 34.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Plaintiff should not be allowed to selectively rely on part of the 1st Defendant’s defence relating to the Understanding, without addressing the Bad Debts Agreement, given that they were all part of an entire transaction relating to the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds. He further argued that despite the Plaintiff’s objections to the 1st Defendant’s reliance on the Bad Debts Agreement, the Plaintiff had not sought to obtain judgment (under O 27 of the Rules of Court) or strike out the 1st Defendant’s pleadings (under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court). This, Mr Wong submitted, was in recognition of the reality that the Bad Debts Agreement raised numerous contentious issues of fact and law which could only be determined at trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At the First Stage, the Plaintiff must demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, something more than a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that he would obtain judgment for a substantial sum (<span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 489B). Other than the Plaintiff’s case, the court will also consider any defences and counterclaims which qualify as set-offs (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (HC) </span>at [23]; <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (CA) </span>at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I pause to note that there is some uncertainty as to whether independent counterclaims (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, counterclaims which do not qualify as set-offs) should be considered at the First Stage. In <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span>, the High Court opined that there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> need to consider any independent counterclaims at the First Stage, dissenting from the approach that had apparently been taken in an English case (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (HC) </span>at [28]–[34]). On appeal, the Court of Appeal ultimately declined to decide on the “true position under our O 29 r 12(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)” in view that the matter did not turn on this issue (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (CA) </span>at [17]–[19]). In the present case, it is unnecessary for me to express a view on this issue because the Bad Debts Agreement was expressly pleaded as part of the <span class="font-italic">defence</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>itself and must therefore clearly be considered at the First Stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I found the 1st Defendant’s explanation in relation to the mechanics for apportionment of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds (see [39] above) somewhat difficult to reconcile with the language in paragraph 9(c) of the Defence &amp; Counterclaim and paragraph 7 of his affidavit (see [36] and [37] above). The language used did indeed suggest – as Mr Low contended – that the 1st Defendant was obliged to <span class="font-italic">first </span>repay to the Plaintiff the sum of $3,602,200 out of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds. Furthermore, while Sum X is presently disputed, even if one were to proceed on the 1st Defendant’s premise that Sum X is $8,728,737.75, there would still be a sufficient money to render $3,602,200 the minimum amount payable. The mere fact that Sum X is disputed therefore does not detract from the fact that under the Understanding (and ignoring the Bad Debts Agreement for the moment), the Plaintiff could well be entitled to a minimum sum of $3,602,200. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, I agree with Mr Wong that the Defence &amp; Counterclaim must be read in its entirety. In this regard, I accept that the Bad Debts Agreement was expressly pleaded as a defence to liability. Based on the pleadings as they stand, the 1st Defendant’s case is that the Bad Debts Agreement is very much part of an entire transaction that had commenced with the Understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Despite Mr Low’s arguments (see [41(b)] above), I am not convinced that the Bad Debts Agreement ought to be ignored in assessing whether the First Stage is satisfied. The law does not preclude the Bad Debts Agreement from being a valid agreement simply because it may be oral in nature; and in any case, the 1st Defendant has exhibited some documentary evidence evincing that there might have been conversations in relation to management of the Bad Debts.  I am also not convinced that the Bad Debts Agreement lacked contractual consideration – indeed, it is not fantastical to recognise that unless the Bad Debts were dealt with, they may have been an impediment to the sale of Acclivis’ shares (see [9]–[10] above). As to whether the 1st Defendant’s subsequent conduct contradicted the existence of the Bad Debts Agreement, this is an issue that ought to be determined at trial; it is not possible to determine this issue on the basis of affidavit evidence at the interlocutory stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the circumstances, I disagree with Mr Low that the present case is “on all fours” with <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance</span>. Unlike the insurer in <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance</span>, the 1st Defendant has expressly taken the position that whether the Plaintiff is entitled to a return of the $3,602,200 is an issue that is <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> indeterminate, because the Understanding (which is the source of the Plaintiff’s alleged entitlement for payment of $3,602,200) must be understood in the light of the Bad Debts Agreement. Furthermore, unlike in <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance</span> where the insurer failed to show <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>that the amount it was likely to recover would exceed the policyholders’ investments, in the present case, if the 1st Defendant’s valuation of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds is accepted and the Bad Debts Agreement is taken into consideration, the Bad Debts would exceed the sum payable to the Plaintiff; in which case, the Plaintiff would not be entitled to a minimum sum of $3,602,200 (see [40] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In view of the foregoing, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to establish any ground in O 29 rr 11 or 12 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the First Stage.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Second Stage: Whether the court should exercise discretion to order interim payment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having found that the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the First Stage, it is not necessary for me to consider the Second Stage.

He pointed out that it was no longer necessary for an applicant to demonstrate any need or prejudice so as to justify an order for interim payment (citing <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2010] 2  SLR 986 (“<span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings</span>”) at [32]). Therefore, if the Plaintiff was entitled to a minimum sum of $3,602,200, the 1st Defendant ought to make such payment without further delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 He further argued that the 1st Defendant had sufficient funds to meet an order for the interim payment of $3,602,200.

In addition, the 1st Defendant’s counsel had given an undertaking in relation to $600,000 of the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds paid to them by the 1st Defendant. The total amount available to the 1st Defendant would therefore be $3,527,682.32, which was close to the $3,602,200 sought. Mr Low further expressed that if the court was unwilling to order $3,602,200, the Plaintiff would be satisfied with an interim payment of $3,527,682.32.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mr Wong argued that discretion should not be exercised in favour of interim payment, for four reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the objectives of interim payment were not met in the present case. This was because the Plaintiff had not shown any evidence of hardship of prejudice. Indeed, there would be no prejudice to the Plaintiff if interim payment was not made, in view that the Plaintiff’s interests were sufficiently protected by the Interim Injunction. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and related to the above, the Trust Shares Sale Proceeds were already the subject of the Interim Injunction.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, there was every possibility that the Plaintiff would not be entitled to any payment in the light of the Bad Debts Agreement; in fact, depending on the valuation of Sum X, the Plaintiff may instead be liable to the 1st Defendant for $327,886.55, being the Bad Debts ($6,493,355.43) less Sum Y ($6,165,468.88) (see [40] above).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision on the Second Stage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 At the Second Stage, the court has a wide discretion in deciding whether to exercise its power to grant interim payment (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (HC) </span>at [54]). Some of the factors that the court may take into consideration include the following:   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether there is hardship, need or prejudice to the applicant (see <span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (HC) </span>at [54] and <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings </span>at [32]; also see <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Brothers </span>at 492G). Where interim payment is needed to mitigate hardship or need, or to avoid prejudice, a court would more readily exercise its discretion to order such payment. I pause here to acknowledge that the Court of Appeal had held in <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings</span> that it may not be necessary for an applicant to show need or prejudice before an interim order may be made. However, this proposition has to be understood in its proper context – it was a response to an argument that interim payment should not be ordered because the applicant had not suffered any hardship. As the Court of Appeal observed, there was no basis for such a restriction on the court’s discretion (<span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings </span>at [32]). It is also important to note that the Court of Appeal did not at any point state that hardship, need or prejudice was irrelevant or no longer a factor for consideration in assessing whether interim payment should be ordered; indeed, quite the contrary, the Court of Appeal expressly recognised that need or prejudice was the “usual basis” for seeking interim payment (<span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings</span> at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether liability had already been established in the proceedings. If liability had been established, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings</span>, it would be “generally appropriate and just to make an interim order where there will be some delay until the final disposal of the case” (<span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings </span>at [33]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, whether the case discloses sufficient complex issues of fact and law that require resolution by trial, although this factor would not preclude the ordering of interim payment if there is evidence establishing with reasonable certainty the minimum sum that the applicant is likely to recover at trial (<span class="font-italic">American International Assurance (CA) </span>at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I turn now to the present facts. Even assuming that the Plaintiff had successfully established the First Stage, I do not think that discretion should be exercised in favour of ordering interim payment, because I am not satisfied that any of the three factors outlined above (or, indeed, any other relevant factor) operate in favour of ordering interim payment.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Mr Low did not demonstrate any hardship, need or prejudice to the Plaintiff. In my view, there appears to be no (or negligible) prejudice to the Plaintiff because the Interim Injunction is already in place to protect the Plaintiff’s interests insofar as the present suit is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the main plank of Mr Low’s argument was that the Plaintiff had a strong case for repayment of the $3,602,200, and that it would be appropriate to order interim payment because there would be some delay before the case is finally disposed of. However, it must be kept in mind that unlike in <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings</span>, liability has not yet been established in the present case; as such, this factor would not operate with equal strength here. Indeed, the existence of the 1st Defendant’s counterclaims – which must certainly be considered at the Second Stage regardless of whether they are independent counterclaims or otherwise – means that the Plaintiff might not ultimately be awarded the $3,602,200 sought. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, there are legal and factual issues that require resolution by trial. It would not be possible to determine these issues without engaging in a microscopic examination of the facts, some of which are disputed. For instance, it is not possible to determine the veracity of the arguments concerning the Bad Debts Agreement (whether as a defence, a counterclaim amounting to a set-off, or an independent counterclaim) in these interlocutory proceedings. It is also not possible to assess the validity of the Trust Deed without the benefit of the trial, given that the 1st Defendant has contended that it was signed by mistake and has cited numerous factual circumstances surrounding its signing. Before me, there is insufficient evidence to establish with reasonable certainty the minimum sum that the Plaintiff is likely to recover at trial.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I therefore dismiss the Application, and will hear parties on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Justin Yeo<br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mr Low Chai Chong, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Ms Michelle Lee Ying-Ying (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the Plaintiff; <br/>Mr Wendell Wong, Ms Denise Teo and Ms Evelyn Tan <br/>(Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
