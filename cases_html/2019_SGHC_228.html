APBA argues that the joint venture operations in China have been doing well and generating profits.  These profits can and should be repatriated to Singapore, but instead, AS has been deliberately taking steps to frustrate attempts to repatriate these profits to Singapore.  Accordingly, AS’s conduct is engendering the very situation (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>inability to pay its debts) which he is trying to rely on to wind up Connectus Group.

</div>  I do not accept this argument as being a realistic one.  The directors and shareholders of Connectus Group have permitted AS to build and grow the Chinese business from the time of the inception of the joint venture to its present state in the form of Connectus Shanghai.  I do not see any evidence that suggests to me that there were parameters set on how he should run the business in China.  In any event, his expansion of the Chinese business can ultimately be only good for the shareholders of Connectus Group.  As such, it appears to me that they left AS to deal with the Chinese operations as he deemed fit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 From 2014 to 2016, there was no evidence of any email or written correspondence where PN asked AS for the profits from the Chinese joint venture to be repatriated.

</div>  As such, at worst, this was a dispute between the directors of Connectus Group as to what was the proper approach to take in terms of how to utilise the available cash in China – to expand the Chinese business or to try to repatriate it to Singapore to take care of cash flow issues here.  I do not accept that there is sufficient basis to assert that the China profits were wrongfully withheld from Connectus Group by AS.  His evidence, in any event, is that there is insufficient available cash in China to be sent to Singapore to settle all of Connectus Group’s outstanding debts.

I also note that the use of the word “collateral” was also confusing because, as I understand APBA’s case, the agreement was that TSHK had to look to SLTS for recovery of its loans made to Connectus Group.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I have some doubts as to whether AS had acted properly when he unilaterally decided, without consulting the rest of the board of Connectus Group, to execute the cancellation agreement.  He may have been justified in thinking that this was not a genuine agreement, but this was a matter that probably should have been brought up for discussion at the board level.  Having said that, the existence or otherwise of the “consultancy fee” agreement is not quite relevant because it is undisputed that the agreement was a sham, and that no consultancy services had in fact been provided by Connectus Group.  Being a sham, it was not an agreement that could have created legally enforceable rights for Connectus Group against SLTS for recovery of the alleged “consultancy fee”.  So, in my judgment, the cancellation of the “consultancy fee agreement” does not ultimately affect Connectus Group’s legal rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In the circumstances, I am of the view that this issue of the cancellation of the “consultancy fee agreement” does not amount to a breach of fiduciary duty on AS’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Hence, APBA has failed to show how Connectus Group would have any valid cross-claims against AS on account of a breach of fiduciary duty on his part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the issue of insolvency   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In short, when all the evidence is considered, I am satisfied that Connectus Group is unable to pay its debts which have fallen due to AS.  In this regard, I have found that there is no valid basis for Connectus Group to dispute the debt due and owing to AS, and further that the company does not have a valid cross-claim against AS.  That being the case, Connectus Group is cash flow insolvent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In this respect, I did not consider the other debts of the company, for example, to SS and TSHK.  As explained in Roy Goode, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) at para 4-19, “even debts which are technically due are to be ignored where there is no current indication that the creditors concerned are requiring repayment.”  This makes sense in practice, as otherwise, most banks would be insolvent under the cash flow insolvency test, as they “do not keep enough liquid assets to be able to pay all their depositors at the same time”: Wee Meng Seng, “Taking Stock of the Insolvency Tests in Section 254 of the Companies Act” [2011] SJLS 486 at 491.  In this case, SS has withdrawn her application to wind up Connectus Group.  TSHK did not appear in the hearing before me as a supporting creditor, nor did it file any affidavit asking for Connectus Group to be wound up, even though leave was granted for it to do so.  My conclusion is thus limited only to the fact that Connectus Group is unable to pay its debts to AS which have fallen due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Given that Connectus Group is cash-flow insolvent, the Court has the <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> to wind it up pursuant to s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Act.  As Chan Sek Keong CJ made clear in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 (“<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5], the “use of the word ‘may’ instead of ‘shall’ [in s 254(1) of the Act] indicates a discretionary power in the court to order a winding up”.  Hence, particularly when faced with a commercially viable company, the following may be considered (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas </span>at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a petition to wind up a temporarily insolvent but commercially viable company is filed, many other economic and social interests may be affected, such as those of its employees, the non-petitioning creditors, as well as the company’s suppliers, customers and shareholders. These are interests that the court may legitimately take into account in deciding whether or not to wind up the company. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 APBA has repeatedly stressed the point that, while Connectus Group presently has insufficient cash to pay AS, it can and will come into funds because it can seek a repatriation of cash from Connectus WFOE after that company has been capitalised, which parties agree is a pre-condition before the profits earned by the joint venture in China and Connectus Shanghai can be repatriated to Singapore.

This is for three interrelated reasons.  First, there is an ongoing business of the company, that is, its 66.67% ownership of Connectus Shanghai and the thriving Chinese operations.  This is capable of generating cash which can eventually be repatriated to Connectus Group to pay off its debts.  Second, APBA has declared its intention to inject more capital into Connectus Group and to take steps to eventually repatriate cash from the Chinese operations to Singapore to remedy its cash flow issues and pay off its creditors.

</div>
</div>  All these, APBA argues, is indicative of the fact that the parties did not come together on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual trust and confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I do not accept that these facts negate the existence of a quasi-partnership between the shareholders.  The existence of partnership agreements, and partners having differing profit and voting shares is not inconsistent with the existence of a partnership.  For example, in <span class="font-italic">Evenstar</span>, two brothers pooled their Sinwa company shares into a company, Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd (“Evenstar”).  Their respective shareholding in Evenstar was proportionate to the amount of Sinwa shares they had pooled into Evenstar, namely 86.5% and 13.5% respectively.  Notwithstanding their unequal shareholding, the Court of Appeal did not hesitate in concluding that Evenstar was a quasi-partnership, and that the brothers had used the company merely as a vehicle for their object of pooling together their Sinwa shares (at [14] and [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Similarly, the fact that APBA was given a slightly larger voting share so that it could have the final say on certain issues, or that parties had chosen to set out their rights in a written agreement, simply show the specific arrangements in relation to the “partnership” that they had agreed to.  It does not mean that the parties had not come together with a mutual understanding that they would each participate in and carry out this business venture, instead of one or more of them being passive investors, unless of course, such an understanding was contradicted by the terms of a written agreement.  In this case, there is no documented contrary intention whether in the SHA or any other contemporaneous written evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Additionally, the fact that APBA may have issued invoices to Connectus Group for its fees is not inconsistent with there being a quasi-partnership.  Having a mutual understanding that the shareholders would all actively contribute towards the growth of the business does not mean that all formal documentation becomes redundant.  That would not be commercially realistic, especially since PN’s plan for Connectus Group was to grow it with a view of selling or listing it within three to five years.

It was on this fundamental basis that the shareholders pooled their resources together in the entity that is Connectus Group.

</div>  Furthermore, neither AS nor APBA have taken the position in their affidavits or submissions that the SHA provisions are <span class="font-italic">still</span> legally effective to create rights or obligations that govern the current dispute between the shareholders.  For example, APBA has not taken the position that the deadlock and buyout provisions at clause 17 of the SHA, or the default and call option provisions at clause 18, would prohibit AS from making this application to wind up Connectus Group on a just and equitable basis.  That being the case, I proceed on the basis that it is common ground that the SHA is no longer in force.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As for APBA’s submission that the “voiding” of the SHA shows that the shareholders had no right to board representation, I am unable to accept this argument.  In my judgment, it does not follow from the termination of the SHA that the underlying quasi-partnership between AS, SS and APBA had changed.  As I have already found, Connectus Group was in essence an incorporated quasi-partnership between the original four shareholders, and the change in 2013 was that one quasi-partner (LTH) was replaced by another quasi-partner (the Lim family).  There was no change to the mutual understanding between AS, SS and APBA that they would each play an active role in this business, save that the Lim family now participated in this joint endeavour and shared this mutual understanding.  I do not see the abandoning of the SHA, if effective, as evincing an intention to change the mutual understanding between AS, SS and APBA.  In fact, the evidence before me was that the AS, SS, APBA and the Lim family were planning to sign a new shareholders’ agreement.  AS gave evidence that he believed that it would be along the same terms as the last one, and that APBA’s Kwang was supposed to ensure that this agreement was prepared, but this was never done.

</div>  As things turned out, the shareholders never got around to preparing and signing a new agreement, and more pressing issues for Connectus Group seemed to take precedence.  That parties were quite prepared to proceed without the need for a new shareholders’ agreement is, to my mind, consistent with the fact that the shareholders understood the role that each would play in relation to the company and the general nature of their rights against each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Hence, when Connectus Group convened an EGM to remove PN as a director, APBA’s response letter of 5 August 2015 was to remind the shareholders that they each had a right to have board representation of their choosing.

</div>  In my view, it is quite clear that such a contemplated course of action by APBA and the Lim family would be contrary to the mutual understanding of the shareholders that this was a business venture where all of them would be able to actively participate in the business and also derive remuneration from such participation.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Management deadlock   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 There is also a management deadlock at the board level in that SO and PN cannot agree with AS and SS on the right course of action for the company in response to all its financial difficulties.  SO and PN believe that the way forward is to remove AS and SS as directors, to which the latter obviously do not agree.  AS believes that the only realistic options for the company now are judicial management or liquidation.  It is not important who is right or wrong in this regard.  What is relevant is that the parties have reached an intractable impasse and the company’s business in Singapore has withered in the meantime.  In the circumstances, given that the parties are simply unable to work with each other any further, and as there has been a loss of trust and confidence between the parties, I find that AS has established his case that it would be just and equitable to wind up Connectus Group.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of substratum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 A related point raised by AS is that there is a loss of substratum of Connectus Group because the business in Singapore ceased completely by May 2018.

</div>  APBA’s objection to this is quite a technical one.  It argues that AS and SS had filed the application to wind up the company in April 2018, and in their joint affidavit in support, there is no mention of “loss of substratum” as a ground of winding up, and in any event, the state of affairs did not come into existence until <span class="font-italic">after</span> the winding up application was filed.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It is not necessary for me to decide on APBA’s objection to this ground for seeking a winding up of Connectus Group because, even if one could consider the cessation of Connectus Group’s business in Singapore, there are two problems with AS’s arguments in this regard.  First, it appeared to me that SS had stopped working not because it was no longer possible to do so, but because of the ongoing difficulties in her relationship with PN, and to a lesser extent SO.  Second, Connectus Group was set up to carry out a human resource services business.  One aspect of that business, which is the Chinese operations being undertaken by its ultimate subsidiary, Connectus Shanghai, is still very much in full swing.  As such, it cannot be said that the purposes for which Connectus Group was established can no longer be achieved.  Rather, it is the breakdown of the working relationship between AS and SS on the one hand, and PN and SO on the other hand, which has caused SS to cease her career at Connectus Group and for all the employees of the company to leave.  Presently, the Singapore operations are no longer functioning and the company no longer has any office premises, but this is a symptom of the poor working relationship between the directors and shareholders, rather than the cause of it.  For these reasons, I am unable to agree with AS that there has been a loss of substratum such that it would be just and equitable to wind up Connectus Group.  In any case, the loss of substratum is but one avenue to demonstrate unfairness.  For the reasons given at [139]–[141] above, I nonetheless find that it would be just and equitable for Connectus Group to be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Opportunity to investigate the affairs of Connectus Group</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 There is a further point that I must deal which has been raised by APBA.  A consistent theme that runs throughout its submissions is that the Court should not wind up Connectus Group because it would effectively whitewash the sins of AS and SS, and prevent APBA from taking control of the company and doing a thorough investigation of their conduct.

Further, as a director, PN was free to investigate any possible wrongdoing on the part of AS and SS.

[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Section 254(2A) of the Act was introduced to give effect to a recommendation of the Steering Committee appointed by the Ministry of Finance to review the Act: <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping (administrator of the estate of Chng Koon Seng, deceased) v Scanone Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 95 at [34].  According to the <span class="font-italic">Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the </span><span class="font-italic">Companies Act </span>(June 2011) at para 131, a buy-out remedy would be preferable to a winding-up order in certain instances when the court is faced with an application to wind up a company on the just and equitable ground under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he Steering Committee agrees that it would be useful to amend section 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) to explicitly provide the court with the power to order a buy-out of the shares in an application for the winding-up of a company on the ‘just and equitable’ ground. This additional remedy would allow a court to order a buy-out instead of a winding-up in cases where the <span class="font-italic">company is still viable </span>and it would be a <span class="font-italic">more efficient solution</span> for the majority to buy out the minority (or vice versa) … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 A buyout of the shares of AS and SS, or of APBA and the Lim family, had been discussed by the parties at some stage in the second half of 2017.

Thus, the warring parties had recognised that there is still value in the Connectus Group shares.  Given that, and APBA’s professed intention to wish to take control and run Connectus Group without interference from the Seah siblings, it would be appropriate for APBA to consider whether it wishes to buy the shares of AS and SS in order that it can carry out its plans for the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I therefore direct parties to file submissions within 14 days of judgment on whether such a buyout order should be made, and if so, on what terms.

If that is the case, I will then grant the order for Connectus Group to be wound up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Act and also give directions for parties to make submissions on the appropriate person to be appointed as the liquidator of Connectus Group.  The liquidator appointed will have to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, take steps to secure the company’s interest in the business in China and may have to consider whether the business there is to be sold in order to raise funds to pay the company’s various creditors, or otherwise disposed of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I will reserve my decision on the question of costs until I hear from the parties pursuant to my directions at [154].</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Rajiv Nair (GKS Law LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Khoo Ching Shin Shem, Teo Hee Sheng, Christian and Esther Yong (Focus Law Asia LLC) for APBA Pte Ltd;<br/>The defendant absent and unrepresented.  </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
