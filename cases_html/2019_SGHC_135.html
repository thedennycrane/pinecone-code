This matter was immediately escalated to the senior management who sought legal advice that evening. The next day, SGCC tried to stop payment of the cheque but before any instructions were issued to the bank, SGCC discovered by checking its electronic records with the bank that the cheque had been cleared on 30 July 2018. SGCC produced its DBS bank statement reflecting the debit of $4,600 on its account on 30 July 2018.

The Defendant in fact performed on 16 and 17 August 2018.

The effect of a cheque was only to suspend the judgment debtor’s ability to call on the debt against the garnishee; if the cheque was stopped or dishonoured, the judgment debtor’s ability to call on the debt revived, and it was at that point that there was an attachable debt.

R had left a cheque (post-dated 28 April) for P on 25 April. P was adjudicated a bankrupt on 27 April. Notice of the adjudication was sent to R on the same day, but R took no steps to stop payment of the cheque. The trustee in bankruptcy applied to the County Court for an order that R should pay that sum to him. The County Court judge refused the application. On appeal, Bacon CJ held that when R was given notice (which was before the date of the cheque), it should have stopped payment on the cheque. The decision was reversed on further appeal. The Court of Appeal agreed that there was no obligation on R to stop the cheque (which had been given before R received notice of the adjudication) for the benefit of a third party. Further, if R had stopped the cheque, he would run the risk of becoming liable to the <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>holder of the cheque for value (at 416–417 and 418–419). Brett LJ held that the cheque was payment of the original debt and stated as follows (at 417):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The giving of a promissory note, which is a negotiable instrument for a debt, has the effect of altering the legal position of the debtor with the creditor. Instead of the creditor being able to sue the debtor for the debt at the moment, his right to sue is suspended during the currency of the note. The creditor must wait until the note becomes due, and he must then present it for payment, and receive payment on the note and not on the original debt, unless the note is dishonoured while it is in his hands. If the note is dishonoured he can then sue for the original debt <span class="font-italic">…</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>Subsequently, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Elwell v Jackson</span> (1885) 1 TLR 454 (in affirming the decision of the court below) held that a debt in respect of which a cheque has been given, but not presented, is not a debt attachable under a garnishee order. Where a cheque is given by the drawer to the drawee, there is payment of the debt subject to the debt reviving if the cheque is subsequently dishonoured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span><span class="font-italic">Cohen </span>was also cited in the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Bobell</span><span class="font-italic"> Trucking Ltd v Trin-Can Enterprises Inc</span> [1983] 2 WWR 232, The court held that where a garnishee gives to a debtor a post-dated cheque which is accepted as payment subject to the cheque being dishonoured, the debt is no longer accruing due. If the garnishee is served with a garnishee order after the debtor accepts the cheque, the garnishee, having been relieved of its liability, need not cancel payment on the cheque.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Hence, where a cheque is handed over by the garnishee to the judgment debtor for a debt that is due (as in the present case), the debt is not attachable under a garnishee order even if the cheque is not yet presented for payment. Where the judgment debtor has accepted the cheque, there is no debt due or accruing due to him from the drawer of the cheque (the garnishee) that can be garnished. Furthermore, where a cheque has been issued and handed over by the garnishee to the judgment debtor to discharge the garnishee’s debt, and the garnishee is subsequently served with a garnishee order after the debt has become due (as in the present case), the garnishee is not obliged to stop the cheque. Should the position be otherwise, the garnishee would be in an unenviable position of having to decide between, on the one hand, stopping payment on the cheque and running the risk of being sued on it by the debtor or the <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>holder of the cheque for value (as the case may be) and, on the other hand, doing nothing and running the risk of a claim against it by the judgment creditor. Either way, the garnishee risks having to pay twice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>Hence, applying the above to the facts of the case, SGCC had no obligation to stop payment on the DBS Cheque, which was given to the Defendant before it received notice of the First GO. It did not matter that in modern banking, cheques can be easily stopped (as the Plaintiff argued) as stopping a cheque would still subject the drawer of the cheque to potential claims from the drawee on a dishonoured or stopped cheque. Further, because the DBS Cheque was given by SGCC and accepted by the Defendant, there was no debt due or accruing due from SGCC to him pertaining to the July Performance that could be attached. I add that Chew had explained that before SGCC could give instructions to the bank, it had discovered from checking its electronic records with the bank that the DBS Cheque had been cleared.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second garnishee order </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>Following from my finding that the 2016 Agreement did not exist, I rejected the Plaintiff’s assertion that the sum of $18,000 based on the Second Quotation was merely for reimbursement of the Defendant’s costs and disbursements and that SGCC was due to pay him another $40,000 for the August Performances under the purported 2016 Agreement.

He also suggested that SGCC may wish to engage another person to see this through.

It would not have assisted the Plaintiff’s case even if Abdul Ghani were the Defendant’s agent and collected the cheque for the Defendant. The fact remains that before the Second GO was served on SGCC, it had handed the cheque to Abdul Ghani on 17 August 2018 (the second night of the August Performances).
