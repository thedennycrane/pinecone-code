That was a case which involved the first defendant having appropriated for himself a business opportunity that rightly belonged to the plaintiff, which then allowed the defendants to be involved as owners and builders of a project for the development of 82 units of semi-detached houses known as “Eleven@Holland” and a Hakka Memorial Museum and Cultural Centre (“HMMCC”) (collectively, the “Project”).  The full facts and my findings can be found in the reported judgment in <span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Ow Chun Ming and another </span>[2020] 3 SLR 943 (“<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span>”).  I briefly set out the key factual findings made in <span class="font-italic">Innovative C</span><span class="font-italic">orp</span>:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From its inception, one Ms Annie Chen Liping (“Ms Chen”) was the plaintiff’s director, major shareholder and main decision-maker (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [2]).  The first defendant, an experienced real estate developer, was the chairman and CEO of the Clydesbuilt group of companies (the “Clydesbuilt Group”), which included the second defendant (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [4]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Fong Yun Thai Association (“FYTA”) owned the land at 33 Holland Link in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [5]).  In late 2007, FYTA decided to embark on the Project (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [6]).  In late 2008 or early 2009, Tianjin Heping Construction Group Co Ltd (“THC”), a Chinese company associated with Ms Chen, and FYTA commenced negotiations over the Project (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [9]).  These negotiations culminated in an agreement signed on 9 July 2009 (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [10]).  THC subsequently authorised FYTA to deal with the plaintiff and Ms Chen in its place (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff subsequently accepted the first defendant’s proposal to collaborate with the plaintiff as a joint venture partner and the first defendant was appointed as a director of the plaintiff in December 2009 (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [20]–[23]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ms Chen introduced the first defendant to FYTA’s representatives on 24 February 2010 (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [30]).  On or around April 2010, the first defendant received an official invitation to tender for the Project.  The first defendant submitted his bid on 19 April 2010, which was accepted by the board of FYTA on 4 May 2010.  The second defendant was incorporated on 17 May 2010 as the vehicle to carry out the Project (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [36]).  The first defendant resigned as a director of the plaintiff in August 2010 (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [64]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 7 October 2010, the defendants, Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd (“CBI”) (in which the first defendant owned 95% of the shares), FYTA, and the trustees through which FYTA originally owned the land (“FYTA’s trustees”) entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JVA”) (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corporation</span> at [38]).  In summary, the JVA contemplated that:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The second defendant was to issue 1m preference shares at a par value of $0.01 each, totalling $10,000, to representatives of FYTA.  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The first defendant, his brother, his sister, and three representatives from FYTA were to be appointed to the board of directors of the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) FYTA would be entitled to 25 of the 82 residential units that would be built, while CBI would be entitled to 57 units.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement, the second defendant would acquire the land on which the residential units would be built for $70m, which was to be paid by setting it off against FYTA’s share of the development costs for the Project. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The project was completed sometime in 2014 (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [39]).  On 31 July 2018, 21 of the 25 units (as four units had been sold earlier on) earmarked for FYTA were transferred to them. Thereafter, the 1m preference shares held by FYTA were cancelled, and FYTA’s representatives resigned as directors of the second defendant (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [40]).  At the time of the trial, the second defendant held 48 of its 57 earmarked residential units as nine units had previously been sold (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Consequent to my findings on the defendants’ liability, I ordered the defendants to account to the plaintiff for all the profits they made in relation to the Project.  The defendants’ appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful.

</div>  The present proceedings before me concern the determination of the profits made by the defendants from the Project.  For convenience, I shall refer to the present proceedings as the “assessment proceedings”, to distinguish it from the earlier proceedings that culminated in the judgment I delivered in <span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span>, which I shall refer to as the “liability proceedings”.  As parties remained at loggerheads on most issues in the assessment proceedings, the hearing before me was a complex and involved process, which required the assistance of numerous expert witnesses.  Experts on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, accounting, property valuation, and construction costs were called to give evidence.  Before I delve into the issues in dispute and my findings, let me set out the relevant procedural history of the assessment proceedings that led to the hearing before me.  This will be relevant to the question of whether the defendants have properly complied with their discovery obligations, and also shows the attitude and approach that they have taken to the assessment proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After the Court of Appeal dismissed the defendants’ appeal on 26 February 2020, the plaintiff initiated the present assessment proceedings.

In one short portion of his accounts affidavit, the first defendant affirmed that he and the second defendant had made no profits at all from the Project.  According to the first defendant, this was based on the financial statements of the second defendant.  These financial statements showed that the second defendant had incurred accumulated losses of $3,343,956, from the time of incorporation up to 31 October 2018.

They also did not even comply with a direction made by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) that they were to file a supplementary affidavit, after having considered the requests of the plaintiff for more information and documents.

Can the court venture beyond the financial statements of the second defendant, and look into the reasonableness of the construction costs charged by the main contractor for the Project, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Clydesbuilt Pte Ltd (“CBPL”), a company that is 95% owned by the first defendant?  If so, which of the two competing approaches to assessing a fair construction cost advocated by the parties’ respective expert quantity surveyors is to be preferred?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, which of the valuations of the remaining unsold units by the plaintiff’s or the defendants’ real estate valuation experts should be accepted?  In this regard, there is also the connected issue of what is the relevant date for the valuation of these properties.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, what are the first defendant’s profits from the Project?  Should an assessment of the first defendant’s profits include all the directors’ fees, salaries and remuneration he has received from the various companies in the Clydesbuilt Group that he has involved in the Project?  Should it also include the directors’ fees, salaries and remuneration received by his relatives who are directors and/or shareholders in these companies? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, is the first defendant entitled to an equitable allowance for his contributions to the generation of profits from the Project?  More specifically, is the first defendant entitled to his claims for costs of equity capital, costs of provision of a financial guarantee, and costs of his time, skill and effort?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sixth, what are the sums that the first and second defendants must account to the plaintiff in respect of the profits from the Project?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 There are, of course, numerous other less major but interrelated issues that parties have raised in the course of their submissions, and these will be dealt with if and when it becomes necessary for me to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendants have to account to the plaintiff on a “wilful default’ basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The plaintiff submits that the defendants must account for their profits on a “wilful default” basis rather than on a “common account” basis because the defendants have been found by the court to have been guilty of misconduct.  The distinction between these two bases of accounting has been explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UVJ and others v UVH and others and another appeal</span> [2020] 2 SLR 336 (“<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span>”) at [23]–[27]: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A common account and an account on a wilful default basis are both procedures for the accounting of funds.  However, the former does not depend on wrongdoing and a beneficiary is thus entitled “as of right” to be given an account in common form of the trustee’s stewardship of trust assets (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an account of what was actually received and the trustee’s disbursement and distribution of it) without having to show that the trustee has committed a breach of trust.  Conversely, an account on a wilful default basis is premised on misconduct by the trustee and is not available to a beneficiary as of right.  Therefore, a beneficiary must prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default to be entitled to an account on a wilful default basis.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Moreover, the scope of an account on a wilful default basis is wider than that of a common account, as the trustee is not only required to account for what he has received, but also for what he <span class="font-italic">might</span> have received had it not been for the default.  The judge or registrar taking an account on a wilful default basis is also entitled to look into all aspects of the trustee’s management of the trust property and require the trustee to explain any suspect transaction, even if that particular transaction has not been complained of by the beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In essence, a trustee may be ordered to provide an account of the trust property and his dealings with it, either on a “common basis” or “wilful default basis”.  The accounting procedure serves two purposes: (i) the informative purpose of allowing the beneficiaries to know the status of the fund and what transformations it has undergone; and (ii) a substantive purpose of ensuring that any personal liability a custodial fiduciary may have arising out of maladministration is ascertained and determined (<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span>”) at [16]; <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”) at [73]).  This is a procedure that has to be carried out by the trustee, and the court will examine the account that is provided.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Whether the trustee provides an account on a “common” or “wilful default” basis has to be decided by the court before the account is ordered to be given, and that in turn depends on whether the trustee has been found to have acted in breach of his duties in a manner that shows dishonesty or some active misconduct.  As noted in <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [25], it must be proved that the trustee has committed at least one act of wilful neglect or default for an account on a “wilful default” basis to be granted.  Following the taking of an account, the beneficiary is entitled to ask for an inquiry to discover what the trustee did with any money that was misappropriated; the taking of an account is merely a step in the process (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [27]).  In particular, upon the taking of an account, discrepancies may be discovered and consequential orders made, including the falsification of wrongful expenses or losses charged to the account or the surcharging of the account (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [77]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Falsification of a wrongful expense or loss charged to the account, in simple terms, means that the beneficiary may require that the entry in the account be deleted or disallowed so that the expense or loss is no longer charged to the account.  The trustee then has to reconstitute the trust fund <span class="font-italic">in specie</span> or in monetary terms (<span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span>”) at [112]; <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [78]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Alternatively, the account may be surcharged.  Where a beneficiary seeks to surcharge a common account, the beneficiary essentially asserts that the trustee <span class="font-italic">has received</span> more than the account records (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where the trustee has received income from the trust property that was not recorded in the trust account), and the beneficiary is then entitled to surcharge the account to include that income (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [79]).  Also, where an account is taken on a wilful default basis and the account is surcharged, assets which the trustee failed to obtain for the benefit of the trust in breach of his duties will be treated as having been obtained, and the trustee will be ordered to make good the deficiency in the trust by payment of a monetary award (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span> at [120]).  While a surcharge would ordinarily be the remedy sought following the taking of an account on a “wilful default” basis, it is not the <span class="font-italic">only</span> remedy that can be ordered (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]).  Nevertheless, none of these specific remedies are available in the present case when an <span class="font-italic">account of profits</span> has been ordered, rather than the <span class="font-italic">taking of </span><span class="font-italic">an account and consequential orders</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As pointed out by the defendants,

</div> it appears that the plaintiff has misunderstood the difference between an order directing a defaulting trustee to account for trust property which is a <span class="font-italic">process</span>, and an order granting an account of profits against a fiduciary which is a <span class="font-italic">remedy</span>.  The conceptual difference between the two was explained by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [26] (and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [29]) as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the taking of accounts on either [a common or wilful default] basis above should not be conflated with an account of profits. While there is a common aspect between the taking of accounts and the accounting of profits in that they both attempt to quantify the deficit, if any, in the trust fund that must be made good by the defendant to the claimant, the taking of accounts is a process, while accounting of profit is a remedy. Thus, an account of profits is usually the very relief sought by claimants, whereas the taking of accounts may only be the first step, to be followed by the beneficiary’s objections to the accounts presented and his claim for specific reliefs (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 20-017; Lord Millett NPJ, <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Investments Ltd v Hall</span> (2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 at [168]). There are other nuanced differences. For instance, the taking of accounts arises generally in custodial fiduciary relationships, such as <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> trustees, executors, or custodial agents. An account for profits, however, may be relevant as a remedy for the breach of any form of fiduciary duty, regardless of whether the relationship is predicated on the custody of assets. Indeed, an account of profits may exceptionally be invoked even in cases beyond the fiduciary context (<span class="font-italic">Ng Bok </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Wong Ser Wan</span> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 561 at [54]). Further, the taking of accounts on a common basis, unlike an account of profits, is also not predicated on the allegation or establishment of a breach (see, in the context of partnerships, <span class="font-italic">Ang Tin Gee v Pang Teck Guan</span> [2011] SGHC 259 at [86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 What the plaintiff prayed for in this case,

</div>
</div> and what I ordered in the liability proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [141]), is for the defendants to provide an account of profits which arise from the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties and the second defendant’s dishonest assistance of that breach.  This translates to an order that the defendants are to each account for the profits that they made from the Project, and for such sums to be paid over to the plaintiff.  That is the typical remedy awarded for breaches of fiduciary duties by errant directors and for dishonest assistance of such breaches by third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It is important to bear in mind that an account of profits is a remedy granted by the court, very much like an order for damages.  It is directed at addressing a specific breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duties, and will only be granted if the court has found that there has been such a breach.  In this case, I granted the remedy of an account of profits to address the finding I made in the liability proceedings that the first defendant had appropriated a business opportunity belonging to the plaintiff, in breach of his fiduciary duties as a director of the plaintiff, and that the second defendant had dishonestly assisted the first defendant in exploiting that business opportunity.  In that sense, these proceedings for an assessment of the defendants’ profits from the Project are somewhat similar to proceedings for the assessment of damages.  The end goal is for the court to determine figures which represent the profits made by each of the defendants, and to order these sums to be paid over to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Another conceptual difference that is of significance in this case is that an order for an account of profits focuses on the gain that was made by the fiduciary, and not on the loss to the trust fund (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]).  That flows from the principle that the purpose of a disgorgement of profits is not to compensate the beneficiary but to ensure that the fiduciary does not profit from his breach of duty (<span class="font-italic">United Pan-Europe Communications NV v Deutsche Bank AG </span>[2000] 2 BCLC 461 at [46] and [47]).  That is why an order for an account of profits may sometimes result in a “windfall” for the successful claimant.  It is precisely because an account of profits is premised on the gains of the errant fiduciary that it is possible that the beneficiary will gain a “windfall” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, benefits the beneficiary might not otherwise have earned on its own) (<span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span><span class="font-italic"> Systems (S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan</span> [2014] 1 SLR 847 (“<span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>”) at [16]).  The rationale is the policy consideration that a fiduciary should not be permitted to enjoy any of its profits derived from its breaches of duties (<span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [17]), and such a strict approach will hopefully deter would-be errant fiduciaries.  Unlike a surcharge following the taking of an account on a wilful default basis (which is focused on the loss to the trust fund), the remedy of an account of profits is focused on the gain that has been made by the defaulting fiduciary (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Sim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Ping</span> at [121]).  This has some implications, as I will explain below at [80]–[84], on the plaintiff’s argument that the court should order the defendants to account to the plaintiff the value of the units in the Project on the basis of their highest value, from the time that a sale licence was granted to the second defendant to sell the units on 3 June 2011 to the date of the assessment proceedings.

Amongst other terms, the second defendant acquired the land from FYTA’s trustees for a purchase price of $70m.  The purchase price would be paid by setting it off against the deemed value of 25 out of the 82 residential units in the Project to be built which FYTA was entitled to (at a price per unit of $2.8m).

</div>
</div>  This is for two main reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First of all, given that the second defendant and CBPL are both controlled by the first defendant, there is a distinct possibility that the contract price of $70m does not reflect the fair and reasonable construction costs for the Project.  Put another way, the court cannot accept, at face value, that figure as being fair and reasonable because it was not a commercial, arm’s-length transaction between the two companies.  There was no open tender called before the construction contract for this Project was awarded to CBPL.  The defendants point out that the price of $70m had already been agreed in the JVA with FYTA, and that the reason the first defendant had been chosen by FYTA as the partner for this Project was precisely because of his experience and expertise as a developer of residential developments.

</div>
</div>  That might well all be true, but it does not change the fact that this arrangement with FYTA allowed the defendants to use CBPL as the main contractor for the Project, which in turn created another avenue through which the first defendant could derive his profits from the Project.  Specifically, the first defendant could derive his profits from the Project not only as an owner and developer, but also through the use of CBPL, as the main contractor appointed for the construction of the Project.  It would not matter then how much the second defendant paid CBPL for the construction costs since the first defendant and Aldrin Ow, who together own 100% of the shares in CBPL (see [20] above), would be the ultimate beneficiaries of any overpayment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, it is erroneous for the defendants to argue that the court should accept the sums paid to CBPL and HH-Uni as the fair construction and consultancy costs respectively for the Project simply because these figures had been recorded in the accounts of the second defendant and also appear in its audited financial statements.

This strongly suggests that the first defendant was “moving” part of the monetary benefits gained from the Project from the second defendant to CBPL.  In other words, it is highly likely that the first defendant was partly deriving his profits from the Project through CBPL, which he substantially owned and controlled.  This also allows an inference to be drawn that the contract sum between the second defendant and CBPL did not represent the fair and reasonable construction costs for the Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I should add that, after the first defendant was cross-examined, and in the period between the first and second tranches of the hearing before me, the defendants belatedly disclosed on 5 October 2021 more than 48,000 documents, which they claimed showed how CBPL had used the entirety of the amounts received from the second defendant for the construction of the Project.

That would at least have been a step towards assisting the court or the plaintiff in making some sense of this heap of documents.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On 16 November 2021, when the defendants’ counsel attempted to admit these documents as part of the agreed documentary evidence, and the plaintiff’s counsel objected, there was no attempt by the former to then try to admit these documents as part of the defendants’ documents, since they would not be agreed documents.  Neither was there any attempt by the defendants’ counsel to adduce any further evidence from the first defendant or any other witness in relation to these over 48,000 documents.  It is well-established law that documents do not speak for themselves.  As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> at [36], whether documents may be admitted into evidence depends on whether they satisfy the relevant criteria contained in the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “EA”) or fall within the relevant exceptions contained therein.  In particular, s 66 of the EA provides that documents must be proved by primary evidence except in the cases mentioned in s 67 of the EA, whereby “primary evidence” is defined under s 64 of the EA as the document itself produced for the inspection of the court.  Although the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> were made in relation to provisions of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) then in force, there are no substantive differences between the relevant provisions in that version and those in the EA presently in force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Even if the authenticity of the documents sought to be admitted is established, if the documents are being admitted to prove the truth of their contents and the maker of the document is not present in court to be cross-examined to test the veracity of the documents, the documents would constitute hearsay evidence (<span class="font-italic">Soon Peck Wah v </span><span class="font-italic">Woon Che Chye</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 at [27]; Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at para 4.001).  Such documents would be inadmissible unless it is shown that they fall within one of the exceptions to hearsay under s 32 of the EA (<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> at [75]).  If there is any objection to the admission of documents as part of the documentary evidence, then the onus is on the party seeking to rely on these documents to satisfy not only the evidential requirements of formal proof, but also to procure the attendance of the maker of the documents to lead evidence as to what these documents actually show in terms of the facts.  In this case, the defendants made no attempt to cross any of these hurdles.  As such, I do not think that the defendants are entitled to rely on these over 48,000 documents to purportedly show that all the amounts received by CBPL from the second defendant was properly utilised for the purposes of the Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the situation here, where the plaintiff has shown that there is a real possibility that the second defendant might have channelled part of the monetary benefits from the Project to CBPL, it is necessary to inquire into the quantum of such benefits that have been passed over to these related entities.  The same analysis and approach must also apply to HH-Uni, another related company controlled by the first defendant, and which was appointed by the second defendant as the consultant for the Project.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As a matter of principle, the profits which an errant fiduciary must account for should include any profits which the fiduciary has diverted to third parties, especially where these third parties are substantially connected with the fiduciary.  As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 271 (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span>”) at [129]–[130]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">129 … an account of profits is available against a fiduciary who procures an unlawful benefit for a corporate vehicle in which he has a substantial interest, particularly where the corporate vehicle is but a ‘mere cloak’ for his unlawful conduct. <span class="font-italic">A fiduciary </span><span class="font-italic">‘cannot avoid the rules concerning accountability for profits by arranging for the profit to be taken by his company (or a company in which he has a substantial interest) which is a mere cloak for the [fiduciary]’</span> (see Lynton Tucker, Nicholas Le Poidevin &amp; James Brightwell, <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) at para 20-085). … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">130 The Defendants attempt to distinguish <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> on the sole ground that it involved a ‘corporate vehicle formed by [the wrongdoing directors] to take unlawful advantage of the business opportunities’. They argued that, in contrast, and ‘[c]ritically, there is no element of diversion of business in any of the transactions for which the [D]irectors were found to have breached their fiduciary duties’. We are unable to agree. The nature of the wrongdoing by the director in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> is not materially different from the wrongdoing of the Directors. <span class="font-italic">If </span><span class="font-italic">anything, the wrongdoing of the Directors is more egregious: instead of an inchoate business opportunity, what they diverted out of Parakou were the moneys of Parakou. The recipients of these diversions were, besides the Directors themselves, companies that they wholly owned and controlled (ie, PIH and PSMPL).</span> In the words of the court in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> at [97], each of the Directors ‘should be accountable for the profits properly attributable to [his or her] breach of fiduciary duty’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is clear from the observations in <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span> that where a fiduciary is liable to account for profits he has obtained in breach of his fiduciary duties, he cannot escape that liability by diverting those profits to third parties, not least where those third parties are companies which the fiduciary owns.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, that principle applies equally to a dishonest assistant such as the second defendant, which has assisted in the breach of the first defendant’s fiduciary duties, and has therefore been ordered to personally account for its profits.  The second defendant cannot escape its liability to make an account of its profits derived from the Project by diverting such profits to CBPL and/or HH-Uni, given that both the second defendant, CBPL and HH-Uni are part of the Clydesbuilt Group of which the first defendant is the controlling mind and shareholder (see [22] above).  Specifically, the second defendant may have diverted its profits to CBPL and/or HH-Uni by artificially inflating the price of the contracts between itself and these related parties, so as to give the appearance of having incurred higher development costs and making lower profits as a result.  Therefore, a determination of the actual profits earned by the defendants, must include any profits which the second defendant may have diverted to CBPL and/or HH-Uni.  This cannot be done without an inquiry into what would have been the fair and reasonable costs of the construction and consultancy services provided by CBPL and HH-Uni for the Project, which would then allow the court to determine if the second defendant overpaid CBPL and/or HH-Uni.  I therefore find that there is a proper basis for the court to look beyond the contract sums between the second defendant and HH-Uni in order to determine what would be a fair and reasonable amount to be paid for the construction and consultancy work in respect of the Project, including a reasonable margin for profit.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The different approaches taken by LCH and CBF: which is to be preferred?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Both LCH and CBF are quantity surveyors.

Ordinarily, CBF’s methodology would have been the preferred approach to assessing the value of construction works (as opposed to LCH’s approach, which involved a significant amount of estimation and assumptions due to the lack of construction drawings).

CBF assessed the plaster works as having a value of some $3.193m, but he provided no explanation in his report as to how he worked out this figure.

</div>  I am unable to understand how the court can be expected to rely on the assessments provided by CBF when there is no explanation in his expert report as to how these figures were arrived at.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The purpose of engaging an expert quantity surveyor is to obtain a reasoned opinion as to the value of works, having regard to what work was actually carried out, the materials used, the costs of materials, the method of construction, the specifications, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.  However, it is patently clear that in providing his expert opinion, CBF had not considered many of these matters in numerous instances.  I find it quite difficult to accept CBF’s assessments as to the value of the works, especially those which are not supported by any basis or evidence other than his own subjective computations and assumptions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For some of these items, given the absence of information, CBF claimed that he went down to the site of the Project and carried out his own measurements.  For example, for the landscaping works, as there were no landscaping drawings, CBF claimed that his team went to the site to look at the number of trees, and they reported to him that they had counted 400 trees.

When questioned as to the basis of assuming a unit rate of $1,000 per tree, such as whether it was based on the type of tree, CBF could not satisfactorily explain why he had chosen that figure, other than saying that the trees were “big”.

However, what is worse is that CBF did not make it clear which parts of his assessment were based partly on his own measurements and observations.  He also did not set out in his expert reports his own measurements and observations taken at the site, nor did he state how such measurements were made and how the construction costs were computed based on those measurements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 To compound the problem even further, CBF did not even explain in his expert reports how he came up with many of the figures in the BQ.

</div>  However, this is hardly apparent from his expert reports, as he did not explain the bases for the computation of the rest of his costs estimates.  This presents a serious difficulty, for if CBF had used rates which are not substantiated and made no reference as to their source(s), it is then impossible for any person reading his reports to assess whether his calculations are correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 All these deficiencies are serious flaws in CBF’s expert evidence.  Order 40A rule 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2014”) requires that an expert’s report must (i) give details of any literature or other material which the expert witness has relied on in making the report, while O 40A r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2014 provides that an expert’s report must contain a statement setting out the issues which he has been asked to consider and the basis upon which the evidence was given.  In failing to set out and explain: (i) the assumptions he made in determining the construction costs of the Project; (ii) the alleged measurements and observations he made at the Project site; and (iii) how he made his computations based on those assumptions, measurements and/or observations, CBF’s expert report falls well short of the standard imposed by O 40A rr 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In a sense, the difficulties that CBF faced were caused by the defendants.  CBF himself explained that the developer (the second defendant) and main contractor (CBPL) would have had all the necessary information as to the construction drawings, and information as to the specifications, finishes and materials used.  If all these had been provided to him, CBF testified that he would have been able to opine on the costs of construction, without having to make numerous assumptions and guesses, or attend at the site to make his own measurements and observations.

</div> is not an accurate indication of how much it would have cost for the second defendant to construct the Project.  There is a net difference of $26,239,687.10 between what the second defendant recorded as the construction costs of the Project, and what would be a reasonable estimate of the construction costs of the Project.  In the circumstances, it appears clear that the defendants’ costs of the Project have been grossly inflated, which correspondingly means that the defendants’ profits from the Project have been artificially depressed.  In my view, the inflation of the defendants’ costs, and the corresponding depression of its profits, was a means by which the second defendant had diverted economic benefits worth over $26m from the Project to CBPL.  As explained at [39] above, the second defendant, having dishonestly assisted in the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties, cannot be allowed to escape its liability to account of its profits to the plaintiff by diverting such profits to CBPL.  As such, in my judgment, the second defendant must be made to account for its profits on the notional basis that the economic benefit transferred to CBPL worth over $26m had not been transferred away, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on the basis that the second defendant had only incurred reasonable construction costs of $41,323,375.03. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consultancy costs charged by HH-Uni</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I now consider the fairness of the consultancy costs charged by HH-Uni to the second defendant.  HH-Uni is a company that is 70% owned by the first defendant, and 30% by his wife (see above at [22]).  The first defendant accepts that he is the controlling mind and shareholder of the Clydesbuilt Group, which HH-Uni is a part of (see above at [26]).  Therefore, for the same reasons that the court cannot simply accept the amount paid by the second defendant to CBPL as necessarily representing a fair and reasonable estimate of the construction costs for the Project, the same can be said of the consultancy costs paid by the second defendant to HH-Uni.  Any suggestion that the consultancy costs should be accepted as $5m according to the terms of the JVA would thus be unsustainable.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As a preliminary matter, I am of the view that the defendants cannot be said to be under any obligation to account for the profits from the Project until they were ordered by the court to do so on 13 May 2019.  As such, as a matter of principle, I cannot agree with the plaintiff that either June 2011 or 31 October 2018 would be appropriate dates to value the unsold units on the basis that the second defendant could have sold the units on those dates.  The fact remains that, on those dates, the defendants had not yet been ordered to account for the profits from the Project.  It was only after 13 May 2019 that the defendants came under an obligation to account for profits from the Project, and would thus know that they ought to take steps to sell the unsold units because the profits to be derived from the Project belong to the plaintiff.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80  I also do not agree with the plaintiff’s argument that a defaulting fiduciary, who is in wrongful possession of property and has the power to deal with the property, is required to account for the highest value of the property in the period while the property was in the defaulting fiduciary’s possession.  The plaintiff relies on the English cases of <span class="font-italic">Nant-Y-Glo and Blaina Ironworks</span><span class="font-italic"> Company v Grave</span> [1878] 12 Ch D 738 (“<span class="font-italic">Nant-Y-Glo</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Eden v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridsdales Railway Lamp and Lighting Company, Limited</span> (1889) 23 QBD 368 (“<span class="font-italic">Eden</span>”).  However, the cases relied on by the plaintiff involved situations where it may perhaps be explained that the fiduciary’s breaches of duty had caused an identifiable loss to his principal, and the court was thus focused on making orders that made good the loss suffered by the principal.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Nant-Y-Glo</span>, the defendant director received 50 shares of the claimant company from promoters (then quoted at £80 a share), in breach of his fiduciary duties to the company.  The company elected to take the value of the shares received by the director.  It was in this context that the court observed that the mere restitution of the shares (quoted at only £1 a share when the action was commenced and 20s at the time of the decision) would not do full justice, and thus ordered the director to pay to the company the value of the 50 shares at £80 a share (at 748 and 750). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Eden</span>, the plaintiff director received 200 shares from promoters in breach of his fiduciary duties to the defendant company.  The court observed (at 371) that had the director disclosed his breach of duty, and the company claimed the shares, the company would have had the opportunity of selling them at the “highest value reached”.  Thus, the company was entitled to payment of the highest value of the shares reached of £200.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I would describe <span class="font-italic">Nant-Y-Glo</span> and <span class="font-italic">Eden</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as decisions where the remedies granted were designed to compensate the <span class="font-italic">loss</span><span class="font-italic">es</span> of the principals in those cases, and that loss is often the opportunity to sell the appropriated property at its highest price in the intermediate period when the property was in the possession of the fiduciary.  As is evident from the observations in <span class="font-italic">Eden</span>, the remedy in that case compensated the principal for his loss by considering the value that the principal could have obtained from the shares had the fiduciary not breached his duties, and accounted the shares to the principal.  In <span class="font-italic">Ding Auto Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Yip Kin Lung and others </span>[2019] SGHC 243 (“<span class="font-italic">Ding Auto</span>”), the court cited <span class="font-italic">Nant-Y-Glo</span> at [227] in the context of equitable compensation.  Notably, the court highlighted at [226] that equitable compensation is “restorative” in the sense of restoring the parties to the position they occupied before the breach of fiduciary duties.  This was not challenged on appeal, which in any event was dismissed.  The key distinction between an account of profits and equitable compensation is that the former is measured by what the errant fiduciary has gained whereas the latter is usually measured by what the beneficiary has lost (Malcolm Cope, <span class="font-italic">Equitable Obligations: Duties, Defences and Remedies</span> (Lawbook Co, 2007) at para 8.240).  In other words, the amount recoverable in an action claiming an account of profits is dependent upon the profits obtained by the fiduciary and not the loss suffered by the beneficiary.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On the facts of our case, the first defendant had breached his fiduciary duties by appropriating a business opportunity belonging to the plaintiff, and the second defendant had dishonestly assisted the first defendant in that breach.  The court has ordered the defendants to account for the profits that they obtained from their exploitation of that business opportunity.  Here, the court is concerned with ensuring that the defendants disgorge the profits that they have made, and that they do not retain any of the benefits of their misconduct (see [18] above).  As such, the proper focus here should be on what profits the defendants have made or can make, and not what loss the plaintiff has suffered.  In this regard, it must be emphasised that the loss of a beneficiary is not necessarily the same as the profit which the fiduciary has made; the fiduciary may have to account for a profit even if the beneficiary has suffered no loss (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [83]; <span class="font-italic">Murad and another v Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Saraj and another</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 959 (“<span class="font-italic">Murad</span>”) at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Moreover, I am mindful that the profits earned by an errant fiduciary may fluctuate before he is found liable for breaches of fiduciary duties and made to account for his profits.  In such situations, it would be consistent with the focus of an account of profits being on the errant fiduciary’s gains for the fiduciary’s profits to be determined at the time that the fiduciary is held liable to account for his profits to the beneficiary.  As observed in Graham Virgo, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equity &amp; Trusts</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Graham Virgo</span>”) at para 18.5.1: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The remedy of an account of profits seeks to prevent the defendant from profiting from the wrong. To the extent that the value of any benefit has fallen by the time of judgment, the defendant’s profit will have reduced as well.  Consequently, the better view is that the profit should be determined at the time of the judgment. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Therefore, where the value of a fiduciary’s gain has fluctuated, I am of the view that the most principled and accurate measure of the benefit that the fiduciary has obtained would be the value of the fiduciary’s gain at the time he is found to be in breach of his duties, and is ordered to make an account of his profits to the beneficiary.  Accordingly, the most appropriate date at which the 48 unsold units should be valued is 13 May 2019, when the judgment on liability was issued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s objections to LKH’s independence as an expert</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In her evidence, LKH provided certain disclosures that she believed might be perceived as having some impact on her independence as an expert witness.  First, in her first affidavit of evidence-in-chief exhibiting her first expert report, she disclosed that Knight Frank, and in particular herself, had previously been appointed by FYTA to advise on the fair differential premium to be paid to the state for the Project site as at 17 March 2010 for the lifting of the title restriction from “Place of Worship” to “Residential (Landed)” development and the upgrading of the unexpired term of the lease to a fresh 99-year lease.

This duty is of such central importance that O 40A r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the ROC 2014 requires the expert’s report to “contain a statement that the expert understands that in giving his report, his duty is to the Court and that he complies with that duty” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [69]).  In discharging this duty, experts must not only be impartial, but must also <span class="font-italic">appear to be so</span> (<span class="font-italic">Gunapathy</span><span class="font-italic"> Muniandy v Khoo James and others</span> [2001] SGHC 165 at [12.16]).  For this reason, experts should disclose “without any prompting” any existing or recent relationship with any of the parties; a failure to make proper disclosure in a timely manner may cause “serious concerns about apparent or actual bias on the part of the expert” and could lead to the expert’s evidence being discounted (<span class="font-italic">HSBC Institutional Trust Service</span><span class="font-italic">s (Singapore) Ltd (trustee of Starhill Global Real Estate Investment Trust) v Toshin Development Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 738 at [71]; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2011) at para 40A/2/1).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Where an expert is found not to be independent, the court may accord less weight to the expert’s evidence, or even exclude it entirely.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Technomed</span><span class="font-italic"> Limited and another v Bluecrest Health Screening Limited and another</span> [2017] EWHC 2142 (Ch), an expert witness engaged by the defendants, one Professor Harry Mond (“Professor Mond”), failed to disclose that he was the medical director of a company which was in commercial discussions with the second defendant in that case – that relationship only emerged during cross examination.  The court observed at [14] that although “Professor Mond was doing his best to give honest and frank evidence, having not disclosed the fact of his company’s involvement with [the second defendant], it cannot be said that he can be seen to be independent of the parties”.  Consequently, the court attached “no weight” to Professor Mond’s evidence (at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">EXP v Barker</span> [2017] EWCA Civ 63, the appellant, a consultant neuroradiologist, was sued by the respondent for negligently failing to identify and report a cerebral artery aneurysm when reviewing an MRI brain scan carried out on the respondent.  An expert witness engaged by the appellant, one Dr Andrew Molyneux (“Dr Molyneux”), failed to disclose that he had a lengthy and extensive relationship with the appellant.  Among other things, Dr Molyneux had trained the appellant for seven years.  They also worked together closely for a substantial period, whereby they co-operated on papers and Dr Molyneux helped the appellant to obtain foreign placements (at [27]).  In the circumstances, the court observed at [51] that the judge below was fully entitled to find that the weight to be accorded to Dr Molyneux’s views must be considerably diminished; it would even have been appropriate for the judge to exclude Dr Molyneux’s views entirely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Applying these principles, I find that LKH has indeed breached her duties as an expert by failing to give disclosure of facts that might have an impact on her impartiality and independence as an expert.  I am prepared to accept her evidence that her failure to disclose her previous assignment by the second defendant to carry out a valuation of the Project was due to an innocent mistake on her part, or because of some inadequacies in the conflict checks she had carried out.  I accept that she had genuinely forgotten about her previous valuation carried out in January 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 However, the same cannot be said about her failure to disclose the existing commercial relationship between Knight Frank and the Clydesbuilt Group.  As I pointed out earlier at [88], LKH was aware that the Clydesbuilt Group was an existing client of Knight Frank, and that there had been ongoing business dealings between them.  She herself admitted that she should have disclosed this fact in her expert report.  That she then made a deliberate choice not to do so, for whatever reason, suggests that there was an attempt to conceal the existing relationship between Knight Frank and the Clydesbuilt Group.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 An expert must only accept an appointment in cases where she is able to discharge her duties to the court independently, and is free of any constraints arising from an existing business relationship.  In my view, the commercial relationship between Knight Frank and the Clydesbuilt Group meant that LKH was not in a position where she could do so, or appear to be able to do so.  Ensuring the impartiality of experts who give evidence becomes exceptionally important in view of the unique position they occupy in our adversarial system: unlike lay witnesses, they may draw on inferences and give opinions on matters which cannot be readily observed or inferred (<span class="font-italic">Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 (“<span class="font-italic">Vita Health</span>” at [79]).  Moreover, experts are often “tendentious towards the party by whom [they are] retained” (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“H156”</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 419 at [27]).  However, as cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Vita Health </span>at [80]–[83]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">80 … While the party calling [an expert] remunerates him, he is <span class="font-italic">expected to remain detached from the fray and should not have any interest in the outcome of the proceedings nor partiality to the facts in issue</span>. An expert is now required under the rules of court, to acknowledge and accept that he owes a higher duty to the court in ensuring the veracity and probative value of his evidence: O 40A r 2(2) of the [ROC 2014].

Her failure to disclose this relationship to the court constitutes a particularly egregious breach of her duties as an expert.  In this regard, s 47(4) of the EA provides that an expert’s opinion which is otherwise relevant under s 47(1) of the EA is not relevant if the court is of the view that it would not be in the interests of justice to treat it as relevant.  In <span class="font-italic">The “Dream Star”</span> [2018] 4 SLR 473, Belinda Ang J (as she then was) observed at [37]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The independence and impartiality of an expert witness are paramount as the expert’s duty is to assist the court to come to a decision. Under s 47(4) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”), the court has a discretion to exclude the expert’s evidence in circumstances where, as Prof Pinsler suggests, the expert’s opinion would have a confusing and misleading effect as when there are doubts about good faith of the expert: Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) (“Pinsler”) at para 8.040. Even if I choose not to exercise this discretion, I am of the view that the weight I give to an expert’s opinion could well be reduced by the expert’s lack of independence and impartiality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  Given my finding that LKH cannot be described as an independent and impartial expert, I am of the view that, even if I do not exclude her evidence pursuant to s 47(4) of the EA, the weight accorded to her evidence must be substantially discounted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The valuation of the unsold units as at 13 May 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In general terms, both parties’ property valuation experts had applied what is known as the “direct comparison method” in assessing the value of the 48 unsold units.

</div>  Thus, the fact that the transacted prices for the FYTA transactions in 2018 and 2021 were <span class="font-italic">even lower</span> than those of transacted units in Hillcrest Villa and The Teneriffe, meant that it was likely that FYTA continued to sell its units in 2018 and 2021 below market price.  As such, TKC opined that those FYTA transactions should not be used as comparables because they are outliers.  I accept TKC’s evidence as being reasoned and logical.  I do not accept the defendants’ submissions that his approach is flawed because he excluded from consideration those FYTA transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The defendants also attack TKC’s choice of comparables.  He had largely used transactions involving the same four comparable developments, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Eleven@Holland itself, Hillcrest Villa, The Teneriffe and Mont Timah, across all five valuation dates to ensure consistency.  The defendants argue that TKC had wrongly excluded other comparable developments such as Watten Residences, Illoura and Ventura Heights, which were used by LKH as comparables.

</div>  In his testimony, he further explained that the market perceived 99-year leasehold properties differently because of the duration of the tenure as compared to freehold properties.  By confining his comparables to 99-year leasehold properties, TKC explained that this also obviated the need for him to make large adjustments to account for the different tenure of the properties.

In <span class="font-italic">Graham Virgo</span>, it was explained at para 18.5.2 how one should determine what profits are attributable to the breach of one’s fiduciary duties: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the defendant has breached the trust or breached their fiduciary duty, it is necessary to ascertain what profits derive from the wrong by considering whether the profits fall within the scope of the fiduciary’s duty of loyalty to the principal. This is determined by identifying a reasonable connection between the breach and the profits obtained. <span class="font-italic">If the profit is not obtained by use or by reason of the fiduciary position, the fiduciary will not be liable to account for it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span>, the Court of Appeal, after reviewing the authorities on this issue, similarly observed that the profits sought to be disgorged from an errant fiduciary via an account of profits must have been <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by the breaches of fiduciary duty (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [75] and [98]).  In particular, causation would only be established if it is shown that the errant fiduciary would not have obtained the profit but for his breach of duty (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [88]).  Put another way, profits which are unconnected with the fiduciary’s breach of duty, and which would have been earned by the fiduciary in the absence of the breach, cannot be recovered by the beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [98]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>, the respondent fiduciary in that case had diverted a corporate opportunity to his own company (“MN”) in breach of his fiduciary duties, and received, among other things, directors’ fees and commissions from MN.  He was found liable and ordered to account for his profits.  In the assessment proceedings, the AR decided that the commissions were accountable to the appellant principal, but rejected the appellant’s claim for an account of the directors’ fees received by the respondent from MN.  On appeal, the High Court judge decided that the respondent need not account for the commissions, but only the directors’ fees he received from MN, although neither party had appealed against the AR’s order that the respondent need not account for the directors’ fees.  On further appeal, the Court of Appeal decided that, as the appellant did not appeal against that part of the AR’s order allowing the respondent to retain his directors’ fees, the High Court’s variation of the part of the AR’s order relating to the directors’ fees was irregular, and restored the order of the AR in that regard (at [30]).  However, the Court of Appeal noted at [18]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… whether the Respondent would likely have continued in the Appellant’s employment and continued to receive commissions from it had he not breached his fiduciary duty is not a relevant consideration in the fashioning of the account. The only question is what profit the Respondent gained which could be attributed to his breach of duty. In our view, the Judge erred in principle when he reasoned that the accounting of profits should not result in the Appellant enjoying a windfall. The commissions which the Respondent received from MN were derived from the profits which MN earned from the diverted contracts, and therefore fell squarely within the profits to be accounted to the Appellant. In our view, the AR was correct to order the Respondent to account for these commissions. As a matter of principle the Respondent should also have to account to the Appellant for the director’s fees which he received from MN. If not for the profits obtained by MN from the diverted contracts, MN would not have had the funds to pay out the director’s fees. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The observations in the preceding paragraph might seem to suggest that causation is irrelevant in the sense that an errant fiduciary would have to account for <span class="font-italic">all profits</span> following the breach of his fiduciary duties, regardless of whether the fiduciary would have earned those profits had he had not breached his duties, and even where those profits were not attributable to the breaches.  However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> clarified that the holding in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> – that it was irrelevant that the respondent fiduciary would likely have continued to receive commissions from MN had he not breached his fiduciary duties – must be understood in context (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [82]).  Specifically, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>was addressing the issue of whether any loss to the beneficiary would be relevant in determining the profits that the defaulting fiduciary had to account for.  It was in that context that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer </span>observed that it is immaterial that the beneficiary might gain a windfall because an account of profits is a gains-based remedy which focuses on preventing an errant fiduciary from retaining profits <span class="font-italic">derived from his breach of duty</span>.  Accordingly, the court should not make a deduction for amounts which the company would have had to pay the fiduciary had he dutifully secured the benefits for the company (see <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [16]–[17]).  It therefore followed that the commissions earned by the respondent fiduciary in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> were accountable to the appellant principal because those commissions were “<span class="font-italic">attributable to the breach</span> in that case” [emphasis added].  However, <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> should not be read as indicating that but-for causation is not necessary (<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [83]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In other words, in order for profits received by an errant fiduciary to be accountable to his principal, it remains necessary to establish that those profits were <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by the fiduciary’s breach of duty, in the sense of being <span class="font-italic">attributable</span> or <span class="font-italic">derived from</span> the fiduciary’s breach of fiduciary duties owed to his principal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Profits earned by CBPL and HH-Uni from the Project </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The defendants’ accounting expert, Mr Chee Yoh Chuang (“CYC”), had confirmed in his report of 5 July 2021 that the first defendant had informed him that CBPL and HH-Uni had not undertaken any other projects since 2011.

</div>  Deducting that from HH-Uni’s revenue of $3,424,000 (see [68] above), HH-Uni’s profits would be $823,039. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In this regard, the defendant argues that there is no causative link between the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties and the profits earned by CBPL and HH-Uni because, on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiff would have permitted the first defendant to bid for the Project, and the first defendant would then have engaged CBPL and HH-Uni to provide various services.  I am unable to agree with this submission.  As already mentioned at [7] above, I found in the liability proceedings that Ms Chen did not consent to the first defendant’s actions in bidding for the Project, <span class="font-italic">and</span> would not have consented even if she had known what he was doing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Rather, applying the principles set out above at [110]–[114], I find that the profits earned by CBPL and HH-Uni mentioned at [117] above are properly attributable to, or caused by, the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his misappropriation of the Project.  In the liability proceedings, I found that the first defendant had breached his fiduciary duties (i) not to place himself in a position where his personal interests would conflict with his duty to the plaintiff and (ii) not to abuse his position to make an unauthorised profit, by appropriating the maturing corporate opportunity belonging to the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Project) (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [72]–[93]). It was also found in the liability proceedings that the second defendant was incorporated as a vehicle to carry out the Project (see [1(d)] above).  It follows that, if the first defendant had not breached his fiduciary duties by misappropriating the Project, the second defendant would not even have been incorporated, and would not have engaged CBPL or HH-Uni to provide services in respect of the Project.  Consequently, CBPL would not have earned any profits from providing non-construction related services to the management corporation of Eleven@Holland, and HH-Uni would likewise not have earned any profits from providing consultancy services to the second defendant.  Given the first defendant’s position that CBPL and HH-Uni did not have any other projects in FY 2011 to FY 2017 besides the Project (see [115] above), I am of the view that CBPL and HH-Uni would not have earned those profits but for the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I am also unable to accept the defendants’ submission that the first defendant cannot be ordered to account for the profits earned by CBPL and HH-Uni because there was no order for CBPL and HH-Uni to account for their profits.  As mentioned above at [37], an errant fiduciary must also account for profits which he has diverted to third parties, especially where those third parties are substantially connected with the fiduciary.  In this regard, it was observed in <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd v Fielding and others and Conjoined Cases</span> [2005] EWHC 1638 that, while the mere fact that a fiduciary has a substantial interest in a company which knowingly receives trust property does not make the fiduciary personally accountable for the receipt, the case is otherwise where the company is a mere cloak or alter ego of the fiduciary (at [1576]).  While I do not regard CBPL or HH-Uni as a mere cloak or alter ego of the first defendant, the undeniable fact is that the first defendant and his relatives wholly own both CBPL and HH-Uni (see [22] above).  Therefore, any profits earned by CBPL and HH-Uni would ultimately accrue to the first defendant and his relatives.  In fact, CYC’s evidence is that CBPL and HH-Uni had declared $5,349,000 in dividends between 2011 and 2019, of which $4,906,550 went to the first defendant.

</div>  Unlike the emoluments paid by the second defendant to the first defendant and his relatives, I find that the emoluments received by the first defendant and his relatives from CBPL and HH-Uni are <span class="font-italic">not</span> properly attributable to, or caused by, the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Unlike the second defendant, CBPL and HH-Uni were not incorporated for the purpose of developing the Project.  They were existing companies in the Clydesbuilt Group which had business and contracts before the inception of the Project.  For that reason, even in the absence of any breach of fiduciary duties by the first defendant, the first defendant would still have been an executive director of CBPL and HH-Uni, and would have received emoluments for his work as an officer of CBPL and HH-Uni.  Similarly, even if the first defendant had not breached his fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff, Aldrin Ow and Carmen Ow would still have acted as executive directors and/or officers of CBPL and/or HH-Uni, and would still be paid for their work as officers of CBPL and/or HH-Uni.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In short, there is simply insufficient evidence before the court to conclude that the first defendant and his relatives would not have received any directors’ fees, salaries and remuneration from CBPL and HH-Uni but for the first defendant’s misappropriation of the Project.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the emoluments paid by CBPL and HH-Uni to the first defendant and his relatives were properly attributable to, or caused by, the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties.  Therefore, I am of the view that the directors’ fees, salaries and remuneration that the first defendant, Aldrin Ow and Carmen Ow received from CBPL and HH-Uni cannot be regarded as part of the profits derived from the Project which the first defendant must account to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the first defendant is entitled to claim an equitable allowance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The position at law is that a defaulting fiduciary will only be granted an equitable allowance for his time, skill and effort sparingly because such an award is an exception to the overriding rule that the defaulting fiduciary should not be allowed to reap any profits from his breach of duty.  The defendants rely on the well-known English decision of <span class="font-italic">Phipps v Boardman</span> [1964] 1 WLR 993, where the defaulting fiduciaries were granted a liberal allowance for the skill and work they had invested, which eventually reaped profits for the trust.  There, the fiduciaries (the solicitor to a trust and one of the beneficiaries) breached their fiduciary duties by exploiting a business opportunity – they had purchased certain shares in a company in which the trust had a stake, with the aid of information gained by the solicitor when acting for the trust.  It was subsequently shown that the purchase would have benefitted the trust, had it been made by the trust.  The court found that the fiduciaries had acted in good faith by purchasing the shares in their personal capacity (and at their own risk) when the trust had neither the funds nor the will to purchase those shares.  The defendants argue that, similarly on our facts, the first defendant had expended much in terms of his effort and skill to successfully complete the Project and that he acted in the good faith belief that he was entitled to pursue this opportunity to develop the Project.  As such, the defendants contend that there should be an equitable allowance granted in this case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 There is no reported decision in the Singapore courts where the courts have granted a defaulting fiduciary an equitable allowance when he had to account for profits to the beneficiary.  In <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>, the Court of Appeal analysed the authorities on when an equitable allowance would be granted, and then set out some guiding principles.  In that case, the defaulting fiduciary was a director of the claimant company, and had acted in breach of his duties by setting up a competing business.  Through that competing business, the errant director submitted tenders for contracts with the claimant company’s clients, thereby diverting contracts from the claimant company to his own rival company.  The Court of Appeal held that the fiduciary had to account for the profits he had made, and dismissed his claim for an equitable allowance for the work that he did in generating the profits for the competing business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span>, the Court of Appeal observed (at [25]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This court has adopted [<span class="font-italic">Guinness plc v Saunders</span> [1990] 2 AC 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Guinness</span>”)] and has, in the case of <span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy</span><span class="font-italic"> Rafiq v Scotts Investments (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy</span>”), taken a restrictive approach to granting an equitable allowance to fiduciaries as recognition for work done. In that case, the defendant director claimed that he was entitled to remuneration from the company on a time-costs basis, or alternatively, remuneration on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis. In rejecting the claim on the <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis, this court stated that the concept of an equitable allowance for work done is inherently inconsistent with the prohibition against a fiduciary profiting from placing himself in a position of conflict. At [26] of <span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy</span>, this court quoted Lord Goff’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Guinness</span> at 700–701 which addressed the circumstances where an equitable allowance could be permitted to a fiduciary in breach despite the “no profit” and “no conflict” rules:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Plainly, it would be inconsistent with this long-established principle [<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that a fiduciary should not put himself in a position of conflict] to award remuneration in such circumstances as of right on the basis of a quantum meruit claim. But the principle does not altogether exclude the possibility that an equitable allowance might be made in respect of services rendered. That such an allowance may be made to a trustee for work performed by him for the benefit of the trust, even though he was not in the circumstances entitled to remuneration under the terms of the trust deed, is now well established.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The decision [in <span class="font-italic">Boardman v Phipps</span>] has to be reconciled with the fundamental principle that a trustee is not entitled to remuneration for services rendered by him to the trust except as expressly provided in the trust deed. Strictly speaking, it is irreconcilable with the rule as so stated. It seems to me therefore that it can only be reconciled with it to the extent that the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction does not conflict with the policy underlying the rule. And, as I see it, <span class="font-italic">such a conflict will only be avoided if the exercise of the jurisdiction is restricted to those cases where it cannot have the effect of encouraging trustees in any way to put themselves in a position where their </span><span class="font-italic">interests conflict with their duties as trustees</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Not only was the equity underlying Mr Boardman’s claim in <span class="font-italic">Phipps v Boardman</span> clear and, indeed, overwhelming; but the exercise of the jurisdiction to award an allowance in the unusual circumstances of that case could not provide any encouragement to trustees to put themselves in a position where their duties as trustees conflicted with their interests.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It is therefore clear that the court will only exercise its jurisdiction to allow the defaulting fiduciary an equitable allowance where to do so would not provide any encouragement to fiduciaries to put themselves in a position where their duties conflict with their interests (see <span class="font-italic">Guinness </span><span class="font-italic">plc v Saunders</span> [1990] 2 AC 663 at 701).  The defaulting fiduciary would have to establish that it would be inequitable for the court to order him to account for all his profits.  In assessing whether an equitable allowance should be awarded, the court will examine whether the fiduciary acted in good faith and honestly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, I find that this is not an appropriate case for the court to grant any equitable allowance to the first defendant.  I fully appreciate that the first defendant had marshalled much of his time, effort, skill and experience into converting the business opportunity that he was presented with into the completed Project.  I also note that the first defendant even had to provide a guarantee for approximately $159m in financing for the completion of the Project.

</div>  However, I find that these endeavours and risks undertaken by the first defendant to bring the Project to fruition were for the purpose of generating as much profits as possible for himself from the exploited business opportunity.  Put simply, the first defendant was exercising his best efforts to ensure that he could maximise the benefits to himself from this opportunity.  If he is awarded an equitable allowance, and permitted to effectively retain some of the profits from the Project, that appears to me to be contrary to the principle that fiduciaries, who misappropriate business opportunities that rightfully belong to their principals, should be compelled to disgorge all the profits they have made from the opportunity, even if this might result in a windfall for their principal: <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer</span> at [16]–[18]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Furthermore, this is a case where the first defendant cannot be said to have acted in good faith.  Quite the contrary, he was found by the court to have acted dishonestly when he took steps to appropriate for himself the opportunity to develop the Project, by concealing his intentions from the other director of the plaintiff, Ms Chen.  In the liability proceedings, I found that Ms Chen had entrusted the first defendant with securing the Project for the plaintiff because she believed that he could impress FYTA’s representatives with his credentials and experience, and because she felt that the Project committee was less than enamoured with her (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [86]).  However, the first defendant started actively pursuing the Project for himself by late February 2010, even before he resigned as a director of the plaintiff (which resignation, in any case, was motivated by his desire to acquire the Project) (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [89]–[90]).  In this regard, the evidence of Mr Leow Soon Guan, who headed the “Project committee” of FYTA, was that the first defendant had phoned him on 26 February 2010 and expressed an interest in becoming the developer for the Project (<span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp</span> at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Even if I am wrong in deciding that this is not a case where it would be appropriate for the court to grant the first defendant an equitable allowance, I find that the first defendant has not been able to establish that he should be permitted an equitable allowance in the amount of $35,254,794.  The first defendant breaks down this figure into separate constituent parts as follows:

In the first place, I find that the analysis by the defendants’ two experts ignores the fact that the first defendant did not hold any shares in the second defendant.  CBI owned 100% of the shares in the second defendant, and the first defendant held shares in CBI.  As such, strictly speaking, the “costs of equity capital” was borne by CBI, not the first defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 But, even if I were to accept the economic reality that, as CBI’s 95% shareholder, it is the first defendant who would have provided the cash for the equity capital of the second defendant, I am still of the view that there is no proper basis to rely on the “cost of equity capital” as a proxy or measure for any equitable allowance to be granted to the first defendant.

The defendants have not been able to cite any authority in support of their contention that the cost of equity capital can be used to determine the quantum of equitable allowance to be granted to a defaulting fiduciary.  Leaving aside the lack of authority, I am unconvinced, as a matter of principle, that one can measure the value of the first defendant’s skill and efforts in helping the second defendant generate profits by reference to the costs of his provision of equity capital for the second defendant.  When the court grants an equitable allowance, it is to compensate the first defendant for his time, skill, efforts, and even expenditure of personal resources, towards the creation of the pool of profits.  Based on the expert evidence, the cost of equity capital is not designed to measure these types of contributions by the first defendant.  Rather, it is a measure of the opportunity costs incurred by the first defendant in providing the equity capital, so that he can properly determine the appropriate amount of equity return he should expect from his investment.  That being the case, I reject the first defendant’s argument that he should be granted an equitable allowance by reference to his costs of equity capital in the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cost of provision of a financial guarantee for the financing granted to the second defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141   Prof Ng and Assoc Prof Jian have also expressed the view that the first defendant should be entitled to claim from the second defendant his cost of providing a financial guarantee to enable the second defendant to get financing from Hong Leong Bank for the development of the Project.

</div>  In other words, this “cost” is in truth an opportunity cost incurred by the first defendant, or alternatively, a benefit conferred on the second defendant; it is not strictly speaking an actual <span class="font-italic">expense</span> incurred by either the second defendant or the first defendant.  There was also no actual expenditure by the first defendant of his own financial resources in relation to the guarantee.  As such, I find that the cost of provision of a financial guarantee cannot be used as a measure of any skill and effort, or contribution, of the first defendant towards the creation of the profits of the second defendant.

Instead, the first defendant was doing this in order to maximise the profits of the second defendant from the Project, which he could then extract as dividends from the company.

I have found that he is entitled to retain those amounts that he was paid by CBPL and HH-Uni (see [125]–[127] above).  From the description of the time, skill and effort which the first defendant relies on as the basis of his claim for this additional equitable allowance amounting to $10.575m, it appears to me that they largely overlap with the work being done by CBPL and HH-Uni.  Those companies have already been paid for their services.  It is thus difficult for the court to discern what other work the first defendant has done for which he has not already been compensated in terms of his labour.

The main difference in the computation between the two experts concerned whether adjustments should be made to the costs paid by the second defendant to CBPL and HH-Uni so as to reflect the true profits earned by the second defendant from the Project.  I have already dealt with this at [26]–[68] of this judgment.  Another difference which affected the computation was whether the directors’ fees, salaries, and other remuneration paid to the first defendant and his related parties should be included as part of the profits to be accounted by the defendants.

However, the terms of these agreements do not indicate that they were to be a complete settlement of all claims between FYTA and the second defendant.  CYC noted that, subsequent to these agreements, the second defendant continued to debit FYTA’s account for various charges, including this sum of $154,451 which was charged to FYTA sometime after the second supplementary agreement between the parties.  Then, in 2018, the second defendant made the decision to write this receivable off.

In his oral evidence, while under cross-examination, CYC explained that this figure of $100,000 was an estimate of the expenses that would have to be incurred by the second defendant for cleaning, touching up and painting of both the interior and exterior of the units before they are actually sold.  He calculated this figure by factoring in about $2,000 for such expenses for each of the 48 unsold units.

I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that, because the 48 unsold units had been rented out, a significant part of the various maintenance costs described by CYC would already form part of the operating expenses that the second defendant would incur in renting out the units up to the time they are sold.

</div>  These expenses would already be captured in the accounts of the second defendant as operating expenses, and thus included in its financial statements as part of the company’s costs.  Further, I do not think that it is within CYC’s expertise to give evidence of the quantum of such maintenance costs.  If anything, such evidence should have come from the first defendant himself or some other officer of the second defendant.  However, there was no such evidence before the court as to the additional maintenance expenses that the second defendant would likely have to incur if and when they sell the 48 units.  As such, I agree with LQS that this sum of $100,000 as miscellaneous expenses should not be included in the computation of profits of the second defendant arising from the Project.

</div>  Therefore, I accept that the second defendant incurred $965,868 in income taxes from selling the nine units.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 However, in both LQS’s and CYC’s reports, there is a glaring omission  as to the income tax expenses that would be incurred for the <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> sale of the 48 unsold units belonging to the defendants.  Given that the defendants’ profits are being assessed on the basis that the 48 unsold units in their possession were sold on 13 May 2019, it is only reasonable, in my view, that any account of profits to be made by the defendants should take into account any income tax expenses that would be incurred in selling those 48 unsold units.  In the absence of any evidence from either the plaintiff’s or the defendants’ expert witnesses, the best the court can do is to determine a rate from the income tax expenses incurred from the sale of the nine units as a percentage of the sale price of the nine units, and apply that rate to the expected sale price of the 48 unsold units, so as to determine the estimated income tax expenses that would be incurred from the sale of the 48 unsold units.  Here, the nine units were sold for a total of $37,117,570, and income tax expenses of $965,868 were incurred.  In other words, the income tax expenses incurred constituted around 2.6% of the sale price.  Applying that rate to the sale price of the 48 unsold units as of 13 May 2019 ($177,110,000 (see [106] above)), the income tax expenses that would be incurred for the prospective sale of the 48 unsold units would be around $4,604,860 (item 8). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Item 9 represents the commission to be incurred from selling the 48 unsold units, while item 10 represents the conveyancing fees which would be incurred from selling the 48 unsold units.
