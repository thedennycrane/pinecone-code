<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an action by five plaintiffs against the
                    defendant (“Mr Ashlock”). The first to fourth plaintiffs are
                    part of a group referred to as the CLSA Group. The fifth plaintiff is
                    beneficially owned by the second plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Between 3 March 2006 and 28 February
                    2009, Mr Ashlock was employed by different companies in the CLSA Group as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     by the fifth plaintiff pursuant to
                        its letter of appointment dated 3 March 2006 and counter-signed by
                        Mr Ashlock on 8 March 2006; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     by the first plaintiff pursuant to its letter
                        dated 10 May 2007 and counter-signed by Mr Ashlock on 13 May
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By a termination agreement dated 17 July
                    2008 (“the TA”) between the first plaintiff and Mr Ashlock,
                    Mr Ashlock’s employment with the first plaintiff was
                    terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Clause 14 of the TA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14. <b>Final Settlement</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By signing this letter and accepting the abovementioned payments, this
                        represents full and final settlement of all and any claims against SetClear
                        Pte Ltd and its affiliated companies. Additionally, it confirms that you
                        agree not to pursue any future claim against SetClear Pte. Ltd and its
                        affiliated companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs said that the terms of the TA
                    were subsequently reaffirmed in two letters dated 9 October 2008 and
                    28 February 2009 which were counter-signed by
                Mr Ashlock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 20 January 2010, Mr Ashlock
                    commenced proceedings against the five plaintiffs and one Jonathan Slone
                    (“Mr Slone”) in Civil Action No 10-CV-0453(GBD) in the United
                    States District Court, Southern District of New York (“the American
                    Action”) based on various causes of action in respect of equity which has
                    been referred to as “founder benefits” or “Founder’s
                    Equity”. I will adopt the reference “founder’s
                    benefits” for convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The position of the five plaintiffs in the
                    present action in Singapore (“the Singapore Action”) is that
                    Mr Ashlock is precluded from commencing and continuing the American Action
                    against them in view of the TA and, in particular, cl 14 thereof, which was
                    subsequently reaffirmed by the two letters stated above. They sought the
                    following primary reliefs in the Singapore Action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    A declaration that the Defendant is not entitled,
                            under a severance agreement dated 17 July 2008 entered into between
                            the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendant and reaffirmed by way of two letters
                            from the 1st Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 9 October 2008 and
                            28 February 2009 (collectively the “Severance
                            Agreement”), to bring any claim against the 1st Plaintiff and/or
                            its affiliated companies, including but not limited to the 2nd to 5th
                            Plaintiffs, in connection with and/or in relation to the
                            Defendant’s employment and/or association with the 1st Plaintiff
                            and its affiliated companies, such claims including but not limited to a
                            claim for “founder” benefits which the Defendant alleges
                            were conferred upon him by the 1st Plaintiff and/or its affiliated
                            companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    A declaration that the Defendant breached the
                            Severance Agreement by commencing and maintaining Civil Action No.
                            10-CV-0453(GBD) against the 1st to 5th Plaintiffs in the United States
                            District Court, Southern District of New York (“US
                            Proceedings”) in respect of the Defendant’s alleged
                            “founder” benefits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    An order that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiffs
                            damages to be assessed in respect of all costs, expenses and losses
                            incurred by the Plaintiffs arising out of or in connection with the
                            Defendant’s breach of the Severance Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    An order restraining the Defendant from continuing
                            the US Proceedings or commencing any further or other proceedings in the
                            United States of America or elsewhere against the Plaintiffs in respect
                            of his alleged “founder” benefits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Ashlock’s position was that the
                    plaintiffs were not entitled to the declarations sought in prayers 1 and 2 or
                    the order in prayer 3 or the anti-suit injunction sought in prayer 4 of the
                    Singapore Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s conclusion and reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Ashlock sought to show that the American
                    Action was in an advanced stage. The American Action was commenced on
                    20 January 2010. The third and fourth plaintiffs had already relied on the
                    TA in their Answers filed in that action. The second plaintiff had been served
                    with the papers in the American Action although it was contesting the
                    jurisdiction of the US District Court over it. Mr Slone had been served and
                    had filed an Answer in the American Action. Mr Ashlock had been advised by
                    his US attorney that a substantial part of the pre-trial process had been
                    concluded and all that remained was for depositions to be conducted. Thereafter
                    the matter would proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Ashlock said that the plaintiffs had
                    delayed filing the Singapore Action until 17 February 2011. He suggested
                    that the Singapore Action was filed because the second plaintiff was afraid that
                    the outcome of its application to contest the jurisdiction of the US District
                    Court might be unfavourable to it from a tax perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiffs said that the American Action
                    was at a preliminary stage. In addition to the second plaintiff’s contest
                    of jurisdiction, the first and fifth plaintiffs had not even been served with
                    the American Action although I should mention that this was because they refused
                    to co-operate with Mr Ashlock on the issue of service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It seemed to me that the American Action was
                    not at the advanced stage that Mr Ashlock was saying. As mentioned above,
                    the first and fifth plaintiffs had not yet been served and the second plaintiff
                    was contesting the jurisdiction of the US District Court over it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     More importantly, it was irrelevant whether
                    the American Action was at an advanced stage or not. Mr Ashlock did not
                    apply to stay the Singapore Action or for an anti-suit injunction to stop the
                    plaintiffs from continuing with the Singapore Action. In the circumstances, it
                    was also irrelevant that the plaintiffs had filed the Singapore action only
                    recently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Accordingly, I had only to decide whether I
                    could hear the action immediately or whether it should proceed to trial in
                    Singapore at the same time as the proceedings in America were
                continuing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Kelvin Tan, counsel for
                    Mr Ashlock, submitted that I had to consider a matrix of facts leading up
                    to and subsequent to the signing of the TA in order to interpret cl 14
                    thereof:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Ashlock’s willingness
                        to participate in the fifth plaintiff’s start-up in exchange for an
                        equitable share in the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The scope of discussions between Mr Ashlock and
                        Mr Slone in respect of the founder’s benefits which purportedly
                        led to an agreement thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The circumstances under which Mr Ashlock signed the
                        TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     Email
                        correspondence between Mr Ashlock and Mr Laurie James Young (the
                        Managing Director – Organizational Development of the CLSA Group)
                        after the signing of the TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     The conduct of the plaintiffs in the American
                        Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, sub-paras (a) and (b) of <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above would not assist the court in
                    interpreting cl 14. They would be relevant only if the court were to
                    conclude that cl 14 does not preclude Mr Ashlock from pursuing his
                    claims in respect of founder’s benefits against the five
                    plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As for the circumstances under which
                    Mr Ashlock signed the TA, he suggested that the court take into account two
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Firstly, since April 2008, he had been
                    suffering from intense dizzy spells, loss of balance and severe loss of hearing
                    in his right ear. In early August 2008, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour
                    which was eventually found to be benign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Secondly, he received a telephone call from
                    Mr Young on 17 July 2008 to meet him at the lobby of the Fullerton
                    Hotel for a discussion. However, instead of a discussion, Mr Young
                    presented him with a copy of the TA and told him that he would either agree to
                    it or be fired. Mr Ashlock had no other income to support his family and he
                    was concerned that if a diagnosis revealed a serious medical condition, the
                    medical bills would impose a tremendous financial burden on his family. In the
                    circumstances, he said he had no choice but to sign the TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     He also said he thought that the TA resolved
                    issues pertaining to his employment only and not to the founder’s
                    benefits. It was only about three hours after the meeting that he sought to
                    clarify with Mr Young that cl 14 did not prevent him from making a
                    claim in respect of the founder’s benefits. I will elaborate on this
                    purported clarification later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Young did not agree with
                    Mr Ashlock’s suggestion that he had been compelled to sign the
                    TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In any event, Mr Ashlock was not seeking
                    to set aside the TA on any ground, <em>eg</em>, mistake,
                    duress or undue influence. Accordingly, the two matters he raised were
                    irrelevant. I would add that he learned about the diagnosis of his brain tumour
                    in August 2008 which was after the TA was signed on 17 July
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As for the clarification which Mr Ashlock
                    had purportedly sought from Mr Young, Mr Ashlock had sent an email
                    dated 17 July 2008 to Mr Young which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Laurie,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I want to go on record with you that it is my understanding that by
                        signing the resignation agreement today that I am acting in good faith that
                        a subsequent agreement will be reached in terms of my relationship with CLSA
                        and insurance for 2009 as well as my founder status. I signed the agreement
                        believing that section 14 does not preclude an agreement or possible actions
                        should we not be able to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this
                        undersanding [<em>sic</em>] differs from yours.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The material part of Mr Young’s
                    email reply dated 18 July 2008 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I believe our conversations over the last few days have been conducted in
                        a very constructive and cordial manner. I will continue to search for a
                        mutually acceptable agreement covering a future relationship with CLSA and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Ashlock accepted that Mr Young
                    did not agree with him that he could still pursue a claim on the founder’s
                    benefits. However, he disingenuously suggested that Mr Young did not
                    disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was clear to me that Mr Young did
                    disagree although he did so politely and that Mr Ashlock knew that
                    Mr Young was disagreeing. I was of the view that Mr Ashlock’s
                    email dated 17 July 2008 was a self-serving one and did not assist me in
                    the interpretation of cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As for the plaintiffs, they sought to rely on
                    two letters which Mr Ashlock counter-signed to argue that he had accepted
                    Mr Young’s stand on cl 14.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The reference to a 17 July 2008 letter
                    was in fact to the TA dated 17 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As mentioned above, Mr Ashlock had
                    counter-signed these two letters. I was of the view that by counter-signing
                    these two letters, Mr Ashlock had affirmed the TA and it was too late for
                    him to resile from it. This was an additional reason why his allegations about
                    his health and about being compelled to sign the TA were irrelevant. However,
                    the counter-signing of the two letters did not necessarily mean that he had
                    agreed with Mr Young’s view on cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The above discussion covers sub-paras (c) and
                    (d) of <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above. As for sub-para (e) of
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above, I did not see how the
                    conduct of the plaintiffs in the American Action would affect the interpretation
                    of cl 14. Indeed, Mr Tan did not substantiate his argument that such
                    conduct would affect the said interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As regards the governing law of the TA, the
                    plaintiffs contended that the governing law was Singapore law. Mr Ashlock
                    apparently did not agree but he did not say what the governing law was. The
                    employment which was terminated by the TA was the subject of a letter from the
                    first plaintiff to Mr Ashlock dated 10 May 2007 and counter-signed by
                    him on 13 May 2007 (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). The
                    terms thereof expressly stated that the governing law was Singapore law. The
                    first plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore and Mr Ashlock was
                    stationed in Singapore while he was employed by the first plaintiff. The TA was
                    signed in Singapore. In the circumstances, I concluded that Singapore law was
                    the governing law of the TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I would also mention that although the TA was
                    entered into between the first plaintiff and Mr Ashlock, the second to
                    fourth plaintiffs were also seeking to enforce it by relying on
                        s 2(1)(<em>b</em>) and 2(3) of the Contracts
                    (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed). Mr Alvin Yeo,
                    SC, counsel for the plaintiffs, submitted that the second to fourth plaintiffs
                    were affiliated companies of the first plaintiff for the purpose of cl 14.
                    Mr Tan did not contest these submissions. In any event, even if the second
                    to fourth plaintiffs were not entitled to enforce the TA, it was accepted that
                    the first plaintiff certainly was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Ashlock contended that the TA only
                    resolved issues relating to his employment and cl 14 did not preclude him
                    from claiming the founder’s benefits against any of the plaintiffs. His
                    contention ignored the obvious point that the resolution was on certain terms,
                    one of which was cl 14, and that it was open to the parties to agree that
                    he was not to make any claim against the plaintiffs as part of the terms of the
                    resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my view, the terms of cl 14 were
                    simple and clear (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above). The TA was
                    in full and final settlement of all claims by Mr Ashlock against the
                    plaintiffs. The sentence that Mr Ashlock agrees not to pursue any future
                    claim against the plaintiffs was really a consequence of the full and final
                    settlement. Therefore, Mr Ashlock was not entitled to commence or continue
                    with the American Action against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I would add that Mr Ashlock sought to
                    rely on some conversations between him and Mr Young subsequent to the TA
                    and an email dated 13 January 2009 from him to Mr Young to show that
                    the issue of the founder’s benefits was still kept alive after the TA was
                    signed. However, Mr Young said that he had only agreed to speak to
                    Mr Slone about such benefits and that that was a matter between the two
                    individuals. I would add that an earlier email from Mr Young dated
                    11 January 2009 supported Mr Young’s version which I
                    accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In any event, subsequent statements do not,
                    generally speaking, affect the interpretation of a provision unless they
                    constitute an estoppel. Mr Ashlock was not relying on estoppel. Neither was
                    he relying on a waiver or a variation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the circumstances, I was of the view that
                    the plaintiffs were entitled to the declarations sought in prayers 1 and
                    2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As for prayer 4 about an anti-suit injunction,
                    Mr Tan referred to various authorities and in particular, <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and
                        others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 to support
                    Mr Ashlock’s position that an anti-suit injunction ought not to be
                    granted against Mr Ashlock even if I were to rule on the interpretation of
                    cl 14 in the plaintiffs’ favour. He stressed that the American Action
                    was not vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiffs. In that case, the Court of
                    Appeal stated at [28] and [29]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28 In <em>Evergreen International SA v
                            Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 457
                            ("<em>Evergreen International SA</em>"), Belinda
                        Ang Saw Ean J ("Ang J") stated that she had to consider the
                        following elements in determining whether an anti-suit injunction ought to
                        be granted in the case (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) whether the defendants are amenable to the jurisdiction of the
                            Singapore court;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the
                            parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the alleged vexation or oppression to the plaintiffs if the
                            foreign proceedings are to continue; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the alleged injustice to the defendants as an injunction would
                            deprive the defendants of the advantages sought in the foreign
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29 In our view, this is as good a list as any with only one qualification,
                        which would constitute a fifth element - whether the institution of the
                        foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties (see
                            <em>South Carolina Insurance Co v Assurantie Maatschappij
                            "De Zeven Provincien"</em> NV [1987] AC 24). Where there is such
                        an agreement, the court may not feel diffident about granting an anti-suit
                        injunction as it would only be enforcing a contractual promise and the
                        question of international comity is not as relevant (see <em>The Angelic Grace</em> [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 96 and
                            <em>WSG Nimbus Pte Ltd v Board of Control for Cricket in
                            Sri Lanka</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1088 at [91]). However, as far as
                        the present case was concerned, this element did not come into play as there
                        was no such agreement between the parties. That said, we will now examined
                        each of these elements in relation to the facts and circumstances of the
                        present case, although one could say that the third and fourth elements are
                        really quite closely related, being two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the present case, Mr Ashlock had
                    agreed under cl 14 not to pursue any future claim against the first
                    defendant and its affiliated companies. This was a consequence of the full and
                    final settlement of all his claims (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>
                    above). Moreover, the cases which Mr Tan relied on were cases in which the
                    court was asked to grant an interlocutory anti-suit injunction to restrain a
                    party from proceeding with a foreign action pending the outcome of the
                    proceedings in the jurisdiction from which the injunction was sought. In the
                    case before me, the plaintiffs were not seeking an interlocutory anti-suit
                    injunction but a permanent one on the premise that the court would be able to
                    and would make a finding in their favour on the interpretation of
                    cl 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I agreed with Mr Yeo that if I were to
                    interpret cl 14 in the plaintiffs’ favour, then an anti-suit
                    injunction ought, generally speaking, to be granted to enforce my ruling since
                    Mr Ashlock had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.
                    Indeed he is currently working in Singapore. The general rule is subject to
                    Mr Ashlock showing a special or exceptional reason why the injunction
                    should not be granted. No such reason was shown. All Mr Tan could say was
                    that the American Action was at an advanced stage but that was no reason to
                    allow Mr Ashlock to continue with it once a final ruling was given by a
                    competent court whose jurisdiction he had submitted to. In the light of my
                    ruling on the interpretation of cl 14, the American Action against the
                    plaintiffs was both in breach of cl 14 and vexatious and
                oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the circumstances, I made the declarations
                    sought in prayers 1 and 2 and granted the anti-suit injunction sought in prayer
                    4. I did not grant prayer 3 for Mr Ashlock to pay damages to be assessed
                    because the American Action had not caused any damage to the plaintiffs, leaving
                    aside the question of costs. I was also of the view that any costs incurred by
                    the second, third or fourth plaintiffs (or by any other plaintiff) in respect of
                    the American Action ought to be dealt with by the US District Court and so I did
                    not deal with such costs. However, I did order Mr Ashlock to pay the costs
                    of the plaintiffs in respect of the Singapore Action which I fixed at $15,000. I
                    also made it clear that my decision did not preclude Mr Ashlock from
                    continuing with the American Action against Mr Slone.</p>
