<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a summary judgment application taken out
                    by AmFraser Securities Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”) for final
                    judgment to be entered against Mr Goh Chengyu (“the Defendant”) in
                    Suit No 88 of 2014. At the end of the hearing for the application, I reserved
                    judgment as interesting questions of law pertaining to the use of conclusive
                    evidence clauses in a securities trading context which merit closer analysis
                    were raised in the course of submissions by counsel. I now give my decision with
                    grounds attached.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background of the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a company which provides
                        <em>inter alia</em> stockbroking services in retail and
                    institutional securities. On 18 January 2013, by way of an account opening
                    document (the “application form”) entitled “Application for
                    Opening of Trading Account (Individual)”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Defendant applied to the Plaintiff
                    requesting the opening of a securities trading account under which the Plaintiff
                    was to provide trading and dealing services to the Defendant. Pursuant to
                    paragraph 10 of the application form, the Defendant agreed to be bound by
                        <em>inter alia</em> the Plaintiff’s standard
                    terms and conditions contained in a separate document entitled “Terms and
                    Conditions for Operation of Securities Trading Account” (hereafter
                    “the OSTA Terms and Conditions”). In the application form, one Mr
                    Heng Gim Teoh (“HGT”) was named as the “trading
                    representative” under the proposed securities trading account. Following
                    the Plaintiff’s approval of the Defendant’s application, the
                    Defendant’s securities trading account (“the trading
                    account”) was opened on 22 January 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Following a dispute between the parties, the
                    Plaintiff filed Suit No 88 of 2014 on 22 January 2014 against the Defendant
                    claiming <em>inter alia</em> a sum of $1,888,954.60 which
                    the Plaintiff avers was outstanding as at 13 December 2013 (hereafter
                    “the sum claimed”). According to the Plaintiff, the sum claimed
                    accrued as a result of “various dealings in investments and transactions
                    made by the Plaintiff on behalf of the Defendant”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the “investments
                    and transactions” referred to were purchases of shares in Blumont
                    Limited, Asiasons Capital Limited and International Healthway Corporation
                    Limited on or around 2 October 2013 (hereafter “the Disputed
                    Investments”). With respect to the Disputed Investments, the Plaintiff
                    claims that they had been properly carried out on behalf of the
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Defendant denies the Plaintiff’s
                    claim. In his Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant avers <em>inter alia</em> that the Disputed Investments were carried out
                    without his prior knowledge and authority.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In
                    particular, the Defendant claims that he only came to know about the Disputed
                    Investments on 5 October 2013 when he was perusing a contract note which he
                    received from Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) indicating that purchases of
                    shares in Blumont Limited, Asiasons Capital Limited and International Healthway
                    Corporation Limited have been booked under the trading account on or around 2
                    October 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Following the
                    Defendant’s alleged discovery of the Disputed Investments, the Defendant
                    arranged for a meeting (“the First Meeting”) with HGT to take
                    place on 7 October 2013 at the Defendant’s office, allegedly for the
                    purpose of making inquiries regarding the Disputed Investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The First Meeting was attended by the Defendant,
                    HGT, one Mr Goh Yee Gee (the Defendant’s uncle) (“GYG”) and
                    one Mr Goh Rong Cheng (the Defendant’s paternal cousin, who is also known
                    as Lucas Goh) (“GRC”). According to the Defendant, HGT admitted
                    during the First Meeting that (a) he had increased the trading account limit
                    without the Defendant’s authorisation, instruction or knowledge and (b) he
                    had without the Defendant’s authority or instructions used the trading
                    account to book the Disputed Investments on behalf of one Mr Lim Lin Ken
                    (“LLK”). HGT also allegedly assured the Defendant during the First
                    Meeting that the Defendant would not have to be responsible for the losses which
                    have been incurred under the Disputed Investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After the First Meeting, the Defendant arranged
                    for another meeting (“the Second Meeting”) to take place –
                    this time at the Plaintiff’s office premises on 10 October 2013 – to
                    “discuss” the Disputed Investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    The Second Meeting was attended by the Plaintiff’s executive director Mr
                    Lim Wing How (“LWH”), one of the Plaintiff’s compliance
                    officers Mr Chen Moh Yong (“CMY”), the Defendant, GYG, GRC and
                    HGT. At the Second Meeting, the Defendant informed LWH that the Disputed
                    Transactions were entered into without the Defendant’s authority, and HGT
                    allegedly admitted once again that he had carried out the Disputed Investments
                    for LLK without the Defendant’s knowledge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Defendant further avers that at one
                    point during the Second Meeting, HGT was cut off by LWH while he (HGT) was
                    making his admission, because LWH did not want HGT to finish giving his
                        explanation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff does not appear to deny that the
                    First Meeting and the Second Meeting did in fact take place. However, the
                    Plaintiff disputes the Defendant’s account that HGT had made admissions in
                    relation to the Disputed Investments. At this juncture, I pause to observe that
                    HGT has since the time the dispute has arisen between the Plaintiff and the
                    Defendant formally affirmed a statutory declaration pursuant to the Oaths and
                    Declarations Act (Cap 211, 2001 Rev Ed) stating that at no point in time has he
                    ever admitted to carrying out the Disputed Investments without the
                    Defendant’s prior authorisation. In his statutory declaration, HGT stated
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    … I wish to state that I have never stated
                            that the [Disputed Investments] were carried out without the explicit
                            authorisation of [the Defendant]. As is the case with all my clients, I
                            will verify the caller’s name and NRIC number whenever a client
                            calls me and requests that I execute a transaction on his
                        behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Practically speaking, I will definitely require the
                            caller’s full name and NRIC number in order to know which trading
                            account the client is talking about.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    In fact, on previous occasions, I have obtained
                            similar instructions from [the Defendant] via telephone as
                        well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For completeness, it should be pointed out that
                    HGT’s statutory declaration, which was tendered before this court in the
                    hearing, was affirmed on pain of potentially severe criminal penalties should it
                    ever transpire that he has made a false statutory declaration (see section 14(1)
                    of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211, 2001 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiff also disputes the
                    Defendant’s account of what had actually transpired during the Second
                    Meeting. LWH, for instance, has deposed in an affidavit denying having cut off
                    HGT during the Second Meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In fact,
                    LWH categorically refutes the Defendant’s allegation that HGT has admitted
                    to carrying out the Disputed Investments without the Defendant’s knowledge
                    and authority.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In this last regard, I should also
                    add that CMY has also deposed in an affidavit corroborating the position taken
                    by LWH.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the hearing before me, there was nothing on
                    record which objectively confirms or denies the existence of LLK.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case theories and arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the course of the hearing, two competing
                    case theories emerged from counsel’s arguments. The Plaintiff’s case
                    theory, simply put, paints the Defendant as a bad client who is trying to evade
                    his contractual obligations to pay the Plaintiff for its services by disclaiming
                    investments which although were properly made on his behalf, had gone south. In
                    support of this case theory, Plaintiff’s counsel drew this court’s
                    attention to the trading account statements showing that the Defendant has been
                    investing profitably in shares in Blumont Limited, Asiasons Capital Limited and
                    International Healthway Corporation Limited for several months before the
                    Disputed Investments were made.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It was pointed out to this court that no
                    issues of knowledge and authority in respect of those investments were raised by
                    the Defendant when those investments were making gains; by contrast, the
                    Disputed Investments which the Defendant is complaining about are investments
                    that have suffered severe losses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> By raising this point to the court, I take
                    Plaintiff’s counsel to be suggesting that the Defendant’s complaints
                    regarding the lack of his knowledge and authorisation in respect of the Disputed
                    Investments are an afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Defendant’s case theory, as can
                    already be gleaned from above, is principally that the Disputed Investments were
                    entered into by HGT without the Defendant’s prior knowledge or
                    authorisation. Regarding the Plaintiff’s suggestion that the Defendant is
                    now complaining about the Disputed Investments only because those investments
                    have made severe losses, Defendant’s counsel countered by alluding to
                    parts of the trading account statements showing that the Defendant has
                    previously on occasion also made some losses that were not insubstantial in the
                    months preceding the Disputed Investments. Yet, the Defendant did not raise any
                    issue over his knowledge and authorisation in respect of those other loss-making
                    investments. Defendant’s counsel argues that if the Defendant is indeed a
                    client whose motive is that ascribed by the Plaintiff, why would the Defendant
                    not also have complained about those other investments as well? This – so
                    the argument goes – together with HGT’s alleged admissions in the
                    First Meeting and Second Meeting raise issues which ought to be tried before a
                    judge. Accordingly, Defendant’s counsel submits that summary judgment
                    should not be granted in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Admittedly, the application before me could
                    have been much more straightforward if not for the reliance placed by the
                    Plaintiff on <em>inter alia</em> several contractual
                    provisions found in OSTA Terms and Condition which sparked a rather spirited
                    debate between Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant’s counsel in the
                    hearing before me. The key contractual provisions relied on are clauses 10.1,
                    11, 17.1, 27.1 and 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions which are reproduced
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.1  The [Defendant] shall on demand pay to [the
                            Plaintiff] such sums of money to enable [the Plaintiff] to discharge any
                            liability incurred or to be incurred in connection with Transactions
                            effected or to be effected for the Account(s) and shall on demand
                            reimburse [the Plaintiff] all costs, charges, and expenses incurred by
                            [the Plaintiff] in connection therewith including legal costs on a full
                            indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[…]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    The [Defendant] agrees to pay interest on all
                            amounts owed by the [Defendant] to [the Plaintiff] after as well as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics and bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Plaintiff relies heavily on clause 27.1 in
                    the present application, arguing that it is entitled to deem HGT to be the
                    Defendant’s agent under the Disputed Investments. On this argument, it
                    would follow that the Plaintiff is also entitled to assume that the Disputed
                    Investments carried out by HGT were in fact intended to be carried out by the
                    Defendant. Accordingly, the Defendant is responsible for the purchase of
                    securities made under the Disputed Investments, and hence liable to pay the
                    Plaintiff “all costs, expenses, damages, losses, fees, charges, rates or
                    duties which may be incurred by [the Plaintiff] in respect of all such
                    Securities transacted” (<em>ie</em>, the sum claimed
                    in Suit 88 of 2014). In this regard, Plaintiff’s counsel has urged this
                    court to consider the case of <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v
                        Seet Ai Kiang and Others</em> [2004] SGHC 9 (“<em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai Kiang</em>”) where
                    contractual clauses substantially identical to <em>inter
                        alia</em> clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions were favourably
                    examined and upheld by the High Court (see <em>Fraser Securities
                        Pte Ltd v Seet Ai Kiang</em> at [30]-[35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Plaintiff’s counsel has also argued that
                    in any event the conclusive evidence clause contained in clause 29.1 of the OSTA
                    Terms and Conditions operates against the Defendant because the Defendant has
                    failed to tender his objection to the Disputed Investments in writing within the
                    stipulated seven calendar days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendant’s specific arguments in
                    response to the Plaintiff’s application are as follows. Defendant’s
                    counsel argues that there is a threshold issue as to whether HGT is an
                    “Authorised Person” or a “representative” under
                    clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions. This issue, Defendant’s
                    counsel avers, involves a question of fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Defendant’s counsel also argues that in
                    construing the OSTA Terms and Conditions, any ambiguity arising therefrom must
                    be construed <em>contra proferentum</em> against the
                    Plaintiff given that the Plaintiff is the drafter of the OSTA Terms and
                        Conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In respect of the conclusive evidence clause
                    contained in clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions, Defendant’s
                    counsel advanced two arguments. First, it is argued that the conclusive evidence
                    clause does not operate in the present case because the Plaintiff has waived the
                    requirement for objections to be made in writing within the contractually
                    stipulated seven days when it agreed to meet the Defendant at the Second Meeting
                    to discuss the Defendant’s complaint about the Disputed Investments (see
                    [6] above). In this regard, Defendant’s counsel points out that LWH has
                    stated in his own affidavit that, upon hearing the Defendant’s complaint
                    during the Second Meeting, he (LWH) informed the Defendant that “more
                    time would be needed to establish full facts”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Defendant’s counsel argues that by virtue
                    of this statement made by LWH during the Second Meeting, the Plaintiff is now
                    estopped from denying that the Defendant did not properly object to the Disputed
                    Investments under clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions because it had
                    “made a clear and unequivocal representation that it would not enforce
                    its rights to have the Defendant’s objection in
                        writing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Second, it is argued that as a matter of law
                    it would be unreasonable and contrary to public policy for the Plaintiff to rely
                    on the conclusive evidence clause to shift the risk and liability of
                    unauthorised transactions made by HGT to the Defendant. In support of this
                    argument, Defendant’s counsel relied principally on <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank AG</em> [2011] 4 SLR 246 (“<em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em>”) where Steven Chong J stated
                        <em>inter alia</em> at [122]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">122    Individuals and corporations entrust banks and
                            employees of banks with their savings and investments. Public confidence
                            in the banking system is therefore fundamental to the integrity of the
                            system and is no doubt founded upon mutual trust and a reasonable
                            expectation of honest dealings by employees of banks. <em>Shifting the attendant risk and liability for the fraud or wilful
                                misconduct of employees of banks by way of conclusive evidence
                                clauses, strikes at the very heart of the presumed integrity of the
                                system. The negative impact on public confidence and trust in the
                                modern banking system would, in my view, render such clauses to be
                                unreasonable under [the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev
                                Ed)] as well as void as a matter of public
                        policy</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mindful that <em>Jiang Ou v EFG
                        Bank</em> was decided in the context of a <em>bank-customer</em> relationship, Defendant’s counsel further
                    argues that the same considerations ought to apply to conclusive evidence
                    clauses in the securities trading industry as well, citing the case of <em>Kwek Hock Hee and Another v Tat Lee Securities Pte Ltd and
                        Another</em> [1999] SGHC 143 (“<em>Kwek Hock Hee

                    the following observations in relation to the securities trading industry
                    framework:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[…] I think it is legitimate to have regard for the public interest
                        aspect of the laws and regulations governing the operation of the stock
                        exchange and member companies. Trading in securities is regulated by the
                        Securities Industry Act and the rules, bye-laws and regulations of the stock
                        exchange. <em>These laws and regulations are designed to
                            create an environment in which the public can trade in shares and
                            securities in safety and with confidence. The Act, in s 16 requires that
                            the exchange have rules to ensure that only people with integrity and
                            who conduct their business fairly and honestly be allowed to be members.
                            The bye-laws of the exchange in turn require that only persons of
                            integrity and competence may be appointed as dealer’s
                            representatives</em>. A dealer’s representative must also be
                        licensed under the Act. There is a disciplinary committee to inquire into
                        infractions of the rules and regulations of the exchange and complaints of
                        conduct “unbecoming or inconsistent with just and equitable

                            representatives.</em> In the case of remisiers, the standard

                        directions for the proper conduct of the remisier’s trading
                        activities. The bye-laws also require member companies to conduct regular
                        checks, verifications and reconciliations of accounts and stock positions.
                            <em>All these are to ensure that irregularities within

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The law pertaining to applications for summary
                    judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) is well settled and need not be restated here. In the
                    light of the arguments canvassed by the parties, I find that the critical issue
                    in the present application is whether clauses 27.1 and 29.1 of the OSTA Terms
                    and Conditions preclude a finding by this court that the Defendant “has a
                    fair case for defence or reasonable grounds for setting up a defence, or even a
                    fair probability that he has a <em>bona fide</em>

                        Bank</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [21]), or a finding by this court
                    that “there is an issue of question in dispute which ought to be tried or
                    that there ought for some other reason to be a trial” (see O 14 r 3(1)

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I deal first with Defendant’s
                    counsel’s contention that there is a threshold question of <em>fact</em> as to whether HGT is an “Authorised
                    Person” or a “representative” under clause 27.1 of the OSTA
                    Terms and Conditions (see [16] above). On a plain construction of the
                    application form and the OSTA Terms and Conditions, I find that there is no
                    ambiguity as to where HGT falls under clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Conditions. “Authorised Person” is defined under clause 1 of the
                    OSTA Terms and Conditions as “any person(s) authorised in writing by the
                    [Defendant] to perform any Transaction in the Account”.
                    “Transaction”, in turn, is defined in the same clause as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[…] a transaction on or in respect of the [Defendant’s]
                        Securities trading account carried out in connection with <em>any request made by the [Defendant] or Authorised Person</em>
                        orally or in writing to buy, sell or otherwise deal in Securities or deal

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The fact that a “Transaction” is
                    carried out in connection with “any request”
                    <em>emanating</em> from either the Defendant or an
                    “Authorised Person” makes it plain to me that an
                    “Authorised Person” under the OSTA Terms and Conditions is a
                    person whose control over all trading activities under the trading account is
                    contemplated to be in theory as autonomous as that of the Defendant’s.
                    What this means is that an “Authorised Person”, once appointed by
                    the Defendant, is permitted to make “any request” to the Plaintiff
                    to engage in trading activities under the Defendant’s trading account
                    without any reference to the Defendant. That any request of such nature made by
                    an “Authorised Person” would be binding on the Defendant is
                    clearly provided for in clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions
                    which provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.1    The [Defendant] or any of its Authorised Persons
                            may request [the Plaintiff] orally or in writing to buy or sell or
                            otherwise deal with Securities or deal with monies in the Account(s) or
                            perform any other Transaction relating to the Account(s).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.2    The [Defendant] shall be fully responsible and
                            liable for any and all (a) acts and omissions of its Authorised
                            Person(s) and (b) instructions and/or communications given by or
                            purportedly given by an Authorised Person(s) on the [Defendant’s]
                            behalf so long as [the Plaintiff] reasonably believes such instructions
                            and/or communications to be genuine. [The Plaintiff] shall be entitled
                            to assume that any such Authorised Person is fully authorised to act on
                            the [Defendant’s] behalf and [the Plaintiff] is requested and
                            authorised to rely upon and act in accordance with any instruction or
                            communication which may from time to time be or purport to be given by
                            the Authorised Person(s) on behalf of the [Defendant]. [The Plaintiff]
                            shall be entitled to treat such instruction or communication as fully
                            authorised and binding upon the [Defendant] and [the Plaintiff] shall be
                            entitled (but not bound) to act on or carry out such instruction or
                            communication and to take such steps in connection with or in reliance
                            upon such instruction or communication as [the Plaintiff] may in good
                            faith consider appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt, [the Plaintiff]
                            shall not be obliged to verify with the [Defendant] or any other person
                            the instructions or communications given by or purportedly given by the
                            Authorised Person(s) purportedly on behalf of the
                        [Defendant].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the facts of the present case, it is common
                    ground that HGT did not exert the same level of autonomy of control over the
                    Defendant’s trading account which an “Authorised Person”
                    would possess under the OSTA Terms and Conditions. Neither party to the dispute
                    has accepted that HGT could directly make “any request” to the
                    Plaintiff to engage in trading activities using the Defendant’s trading
                    account without any reference whatsoever to the Defendant. In complaining that
                    HGT had entered into the Disputed Investments without the Defendant’s
                    prior knowledge and authorisation, the Defendant is taking the position that
                    such prior knowledge and authorisation ought to have first been given before the
                    Disputed Investments could be considered as having properly been made on the
                    Defendant’s behalf. Likewise, in claiming that the Disputed Investments
                    were in fact made by HGT only after having received specific instructions from
                    the Defendant,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> the Plaintiff is in effect
                    acknowledging that HGT did not at any point in time possess the autonomy to
                    perform any transaction on the Defendant’s behalf without any reference
                    whatsoever to the Defendant. Accordingly, by process of elimination, since HGT
                    is evidently not an “Authorised Person”, I find that the
                    irresistible conclusion to be drawn in respect of HGT’s status must be
                    that the only alternative hypothesis in the present case is true, <em>ie</em>, HGT is a
                “representative”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Given that HGT is a
                    “representative” under clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Conditions, the efficacy of clause 27.1 in advancing the Plaintiff’s case
                    for summary judgment may now be evaluated accordingly. By operation of clause
                    27.1, for any transaction made by HGT under the trading account, HGT as the
                    Defendant’s “representative” is “deemed to be the
                    [Defendant’s] agent whether or not such representative shall be deemed to
                    be engaged or employed by the [Defendant] in law”. The Plaintiff is also
                    “entitled to assume that as between [the Plaintiff] and the [Defendant]
                    (i) any order said by the representative to be intended to be executed for the
                    [Defendant] is so intended; and (ii) every order executed by the representative
                    for the [Defendant] is the order intended to be executed by the
                    [Defendant]”. This is however provided that the transaction in question
                    was made “<em>on the [Defendant’s]</em> and/or
                    the Authorised Person’s <em>instructions or though without
                        their instructions but with their consent and/or authority (expressed,
                        implied or otherwise) and/or knowledge</em>” (emphasis added)
                    (see [13] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my view, herein lies the problem with the
                    Plaintiff’s reliance on clause 27.1 in seeking summary judgment to be
                    entered against the Defendant. First, the Plaintiff has not adduced any
                    objective documentary evidence in its supporting affidavits putting beyond
                    question the assertion that the Disputed Investments were made by HGT “on
                    the Defendant’s […] instructions”. Similarly, the Plaintiff
                    also does not adduce any objective documentary evidence to demonstrate in the
                    alternative that the Disputed Investments were made by HGT with the
                    Defendant’s “consent and/or authority (express, implied or
                    otherwise) and/or knowledge”. Absent any such objective documentary
                    evidence at hand, this court is confronted with at best contested factual issues
                    which although may be pertinent to the Plaintiff’s underlying action, are
                    nevertheless issues that this court cannot attempt to resolve in a summary
                    judgment proceeding as if it were a trial. On this ground, I therefore find that
                    clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions does not warrant summary judgment
                    to be entered against the Defendant at this current stage of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For completeness, it is apposite for me to
                    also point out that the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Als Memasa and another v UBS AG</em> [2012] 4 SLR 992 supports the
                    above conclusion that I have arrived at. In that case, the appellants’
                    action against the respondent, UBS AG, claiming <em>inter
                        alia</em> that UBS AG had without their authorisation or valid
                    affirmation purchased some Russian bonds under one of the appellants’ UBS
                    accounts (which bond value subsequently depreciated) was struck out by the High
                    Court on UBS AG’s application. In allowing the appellants’ appeal
                    against the striking out order, the Court of Appeal held (at [19]-[20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Counsel for UBS […] conceded that <em>UBS did not produce any telephone transcripts or internal
                                documents evidencing [the first appellant] authorising the purchase
                                of the Russian bonds</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[…]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    
              <em>We are of the view that the

                                purchase of the Russian bonds should be allowed to go to trial,
                                given the lack of documentary evidence showing that [the first
                                appellant] had authorised the purchase of the Russian

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At this juncture, it is necessary for me to
                    also deal with the case of <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet
                        Ai Kiang</em> which Plaintiff’s counsel has placed considerable
                    reliance on in the course of submissions (see [14] above). In <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai Kiang</em>, Fraser Securities Pte
                    Ltd (“Fraser”) commenced an action against Seet Ai Kiang
                    (“Seet”) claiming a sum of money which Fraser alleged was payable
                    to them for stockbroking services which they had provided in respect of trading
                    accounts opened under Seet’s name. In her defence, Seet claimed that she
                    was a mere nominee holder of the trading accounts (<em>ie</em>, although the trading accounts were opened in her name, the
                    trading accounts were in reality operated by certain third parties). Fraser
                    applied and obtained summary judgment against Seet before an assistant
                    registrar, and Seet appealed. In upholding the assistant registrar’s
                    decision ordering that summary judgment be entered against Seet, Judith Prakash
                    J held that Seet was contractually bound to pay Fraser the amount claimed on the
                    basis of <em>inter alia</em> a contractual provision which
                    I note is substantially identical to clause 27.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Conditions. The relevant contractual provision in that case read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.1  The Client confirms that in the purchase and/or
                            sale of any securities under the Account(s) by any dealer’s
                            representative on the Client’s and/or the Authorised
                            Person’s instructions or though without their instructions but
                            with their consent and/or authority (expressed, implied or otherwise)
                            and/or knowledge, such dealer’s representative shall be deemed to
                            be the Client’s agent whether or not such dealer’s
                            representative is deemed to be engaged or employed by the Client in law.
                            The Client will, as between Fraser and the Client, be liable for all
                            purchases and sales of securities executed by the dealer’s
                            representative for the Account regardless of whether the dealer’s
                            representative would also be liable to Fraser for the same and the
                            Clients shall be liable to Fraser for all costs, expenses, damages,
                            losses, fees, charges, rates or duties which may be incurred by Fraser
                            in respect of all such securities transacted. In addition, the Client
                            confirms that in the purchase and/or sale of any securities under the
                            Account(s) by any dealer’s representative who is a remisier, such
                            dealer’s representative shall be deemed to be the Client’s
                            agent and Fraser is entitled to assume that as between Fraser and the
                            Client (i) any order said by the remisier to be intended to be executed
                            for the Client is so intended; and (ii) every order executed by the
                            remisier for the Client is the order intended to be executed by the
                            Client.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having examined the learned Judge’s
                    grounds of decision in <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai
                        Kiang</em>, I find no reason to depart from the conclusion which I
                    have arrived at in [25] above. In that case, the relevant contractual provision
                    was invoked under circumstances quite different from the circumstances in the
                    present case – the relevant contractual provision in that case was invoked
                    to defeat Seet’s attempt to adduce parol evidence showing that because of
                    certain alleged informal arrangements which have been entered into with Fraser,
                    it was the third parties, not her, who should be directly held responsible for
                    the amount claimed by Fraser. The learned Judge held (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is plain from the [contractual provision] that the defendant had agreed
                        to pay the plaintiffs all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the
                        plaintiffs in relation to her accounts with them. She had further agreed
                        that, in placing orders for trades on her account, the remisier in the
                        plaintiffs’ company would be acting as her agent and not as the agent
                        of the plaintiffs. <em>Having agreed to these terms as part
                            of written contract, it was not open to the defendant to seek to vary
                            the contract by adducing parol evidence of an alleged oral agreement
                            between the plaintiffs, acting through the remisier, and herself, that
                            whilst the account was to be held in the name of the defendant, the
                            third parties would be responsible to the plaintiffs for all
                            transactions carried out in the account and the defendant would not have
                            to pay for any liabilities in the account</em>. […]
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For completeness, I note that arguments in
                    respect of Seet’s personal knowledge or authorisation were also raised in
                        <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai Kiang</em>, and
                    that those arguments ultimately failed in raising any triable issue. However,
                    this result was obtained only because the learned Judge noted that even on
                    Seet’s own version of the facts, Seet “was aware that trading
                    activities in the accounts would be carried out by the remisier on the
                    instructions of the third parties and she was well content that it should be
                    so” (see <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai
                        Kiang</em> at [33]). By contrast, there are no similar factors in the
                    present case. I therefore do not find that <em>Fraser Securities
                        Pte Ltd v Seet Ai Kiang</em> assists the Plaintiff in the present
                    application in this regard.</p>

                        Jewels Pte Ltd, non-party)</em> [2013] 2 SLR 667 at [44]) are
                    satisfied in the present matter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I am not so sure that such a conclusive
                    finding on estoppel can be made in the current stage of the proceedings given
                    the current state of the evidence that has been made available to the court.
                    Take for instance LWH’s deposition in his own affidavit stating that, upon
                    hearing the Defendant’s complaint during the Second Meeting, he informed
                    the Defendant that “more time would be needed to establish full
                    facts” (see [17] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> On a
                    literal assessment of this statement made by LWH, this statement can hardly be
                    said to amount to a <em>clear and unequivocal</em> promise
                    or representation by the Plaintiff that it will not insist on its strict legal
                    rights under clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The question might then be asked whether the
                    requirement of clear and unequivocal representation may nevertheless still be
                    satisfied under a <em>contextual</em> assessment of
                    LWH’s statements, given that in the law of estoppel “[i]t is enough
                    if the promise induces the promisee <em>reasonably</em> to
                    believe that the other party will not insist on his strict legal rights”
                    (emphasis added) (see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21 Ed, 2012) at [3-089]). On this, I will state as a
                    matter of general proposition that a court presiding over a summary judgment
                    proceeding should generally be slow to venture into any contextual assessment of
                    words and/or conduct encompassed in a claim of estoppel. Few if any contextual
                    assessments can truly be safe if made without the benefit of a full inquiry into
                    all the relevant facts and evidence surrounding the claim. Thus in a summary
                    judgment proceeding, I am inclined to hold that it will ordinarily be sufficient
                    once the court finds that nothing short of a contextual assessment will properly
                    validate a claim of estoppel, for that claim to proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This, however, is not to say that
                    unconditional leave to defend will be granted as a matter of course every time a
                    claim of estoppel is raised. A bare, unsubstantiated or incoherent claim of
                    estoppel, for instance, will generally not make any significant headway in
                    raising triable issue(s) or demonstrating any probability of a <em>bona fide</em> defence at all. It bears emphasising that
                    every claim must ultimately be assessed on the strength of its own merits,
                    bearing in mind that the court is not bound to accept all averments affirmed or
                    sworn in an affidavit to be the unquestionable truth. The averments must at
                    least have the ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that the
                    defendant in question “has a fair case for defence or reasonable grounds
                    for setting up a defence, or even a fair probability that he has a <em>bona fide</em> defence” (see <em>Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff v Indian Bank</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at
                    [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In my assessment, I am satisfied that the
                    Defendant has adequately shown cause in respect of his claim of estoppel by
                    making reference to the statement made by LWH during the Second Meeting which
                    actually forms part of the Plaintiff’s case (see [17] above). However,
                    without the benefit of a full inquiry into all relevant evidence surrounding the
                    statement made by LWH, I am not prepared to embark on a contextual assessment to
                    validate the Defendant’s claim of estoppel vis-à-vis clause 29.1 of the
                    OSTA Terms and Conditions. For this reason, I find that the proper forum for
                    validating the Defendant’s claim of estoppel is that of a
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Alternatively, I find that there may also be a
                    triable question as to whether the Defendant’s <em>oral</em> objection to the Disputed Investments during the Second
                    Meeting constitutes a viable defence to clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Conditions. In <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai
                        Kiang</em> (see [27] above), the contract in question contains a
                    substantially similar conclusive evidence clause providing that contract notes
                    and statements sent by Fraser in respect of transactions effected in relation to
                    Seet’s account “shall be conclusive unless an objection in
                    writing” from Seet was received within a contractually stipulated seven
                    days (see <em>Fraser Securities Pte Ltd v Seet Ai
                        Kiang</em> at [35]). Although the court there upheld the assistant
                    registrar’s decision granting summary judgment on the basis of <em>inter alia</em> the conclusive evidence clause, it
                    nevertheless seems to me that there was some hint of a possibility that the
                    court might otherwise not have been so quick to do so had the facts indicated
                    that Seet had at least orally objected to the transactions in question within
                    the contractually stipulated seven days (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    [Seet] admitted receiving all the contract notes
                            and <em>contra</em> statements which [Fraser] sent
                            her. She did not contest any of the trades nor notify [Fraser] that any
                            of the trades were unauthorised. Clause 21.1 of the Terms and Conditions
                            provided that the contract notes and statements set by [Fraser] in
                            respect of transactions effected in relation to the account
                            “shall be conclusive unless an objection in writing” from
                            the customer was received within seven days from the date of the same.
                            [Seet] had never objected in writing <u>or even
                                orally</u> to these documents, much less within seven days of
                            their issue. The contract notes and statements were therefore binding on
                            her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in underline added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the present case, the Defendant apparently
                    did orally communicate his objection against the Disputed Investments to the
                    Plaintiff during the Second Meeting. As such, there may therefore be a triable
                    question as to whether such oral objection constitutes a viable defence to the
                    conclusive evidence clause found in clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Finally, I will address the Defendant’s
                    argument attacking clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and Conditions on grounds of
                    unreasonableness and public policy (see [18]-[19] above). In this specific
                    regard, the questions that arise are twofold: whether the legal proposition
                    enunciated in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> on conclusive
                    evidence clauses in a banking context similarly applies to conclusive evidence
                    clauses in the securities trading industry, and if so, whether clause 29.1 of
                    the OSTA Terms and Principles is unreasonable and/or contrary to public policy
                    applying <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> to the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     By way of brief explication, <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> stands for the legal proposition
                    that “conclusive evidence clauses which purport to exclude liability for
                    the fraud of banks’ employees would […] stand contrary to public
                    policy considerations and would run foul of the reasonableness test under [the
                    Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed)]” (see <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> at [108]). It must however be
                    appreciated that this legal proposition was enunciated with an important
                    qualification that the reasonableness of conclusive evidence clauses in a
                        <em>non-commercial context</em> (<em>ie</em>, where the counterparty to a conclusive evidence clause is
                    either an individual or a non-corporate entity) was an open question to be
                    “revisited when the appropriate occasion arises” (see <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> at [116]-[117]). In its ultimate
                    analysis, however, the court took the view that in any case it is
                    “plainly unreasonable that a bank should be able to shift the risk of
                    unauthorised transactions by a fraudulent employee (within its own sphere of
                    control) to an <em>innocent</em> customer by way of a
                    conclusive evidence clause” (emphasis added) (see <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> at [118]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On the basis of the judicial observations made
                    by Khoo J in <em>Kwek Hock Hee v Tat Lee Securities Pte
                        Ltd</em> (reproduced at [19] above), I am drawn to the view that the
                    legal proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> should
                    apply in the securities trading industry as well. The securities trading
                    industry, like the banking industry, is a professional industry principally
                    founded on the precepts of honesty, integrity and reliability that all financial
                    services providers in the industry are assumed and expected to comport with. The
                    integrity of the securities trading system, like the banking system, is
                    therefore inextricably dependent on public confidence and trust in the system.
                    As such, the integrity of the securities trading system can in theory be
                    seriously undermined if the law were to be such that the public is unable to
                    find any security in the knowledge that financial services providers in the
                    industry can be prevented from employing conclusive evidence clauses to shift
                    the risk of unauthorised transactions made by a fraudulent employee to an
                    innocent customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It would however be remiss of me not to also
                    point out at this juncture one very important implication of adopting the legal
                    proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> in a securities
                    trading industry context. As Khoo J remarked in <em>Kwek Hock Hee
                        v Tat Lee Securities Pte Ltd</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of the purpose and object of the legislative and regulatory
                        framework […] <em>it seems to me to be quite against
                            public policy to allow member companies of the exchange, by whatever
                            means, to shift the responsibility for any fraud (be it by a direct
                            employee </em><em><u>or a
                            remisier</u></em><em>) to the investor. I would be
                            surprised if such a device would ever be allowed</em>. […]
                        [emphasis in italics and underline added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     What this means is that when applying the
                    legal proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> in a
                    securities trading industry context, the law will not only have the effect of
                    preventing a securities services provider from shifting the risk of unauthorised
                    transactions made by a fraudulent <em>direct employee</em>
                    to an innocent customer by way of a conclusive evidence clause; the law will
                    also have the effect of preventing a securities services provider from shifting
                    the risk of unauthorised transactions made by a fraudulent <em>remisier</em> (who is not an employee) to an innocent customer as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     With that, I now consider the application of
                    the legal proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> to
                    the present case. To the extent that there is likely to be a dispute as to
                    whether or not HGT (who claims in his affidavit to be “a remisier who
                    works with the […] Plaintiff”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>) was at
                    the material time a direct employee of the Plaintiff, such dispute will not
                        <em>per se</em> give rise to any triable question(s)
                    under the argument that the legal proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v
                        EFG Bank</em> will not have any bite on clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms
                    and Conditions in the event that HGT is found <em>not</em>
                    to be a direct employee of the Plaintiff. As analysed in [39]-[41] above, the
                    legal proposition in <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> as
                    applied in a securities trading context will cover <em>both</em> a case where unauthorised transactions were made by a
                    direct employee and a case where the same were made by a remisier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, I find that there are nonetheless two
                    key factors which militate against any conclusive finding by this court as to
                    whether the Plaintiff’s reliance on clause 29.1 of the OSTA Terms and
                    Principles is or is not unreasonable and/or contrary to public policy. First,
                    factual questions as to whether the Defendant was at all material times an
                        <em>innocent</em> customer and whether HGT had acted
                        <em>fraudulently</em> (regardless of whether in truth
                    he was at the material time a direct employee of the Plaintiff) are vigorously
                    contested by both parties in the present case (see [11]-[12] above). These are
                    clearly issues of fact which ought to be tried before a judge. Second and
                    perhaps more fundamentally, neither counsel in the present application has made
                    significant legal submissions on whether and if so how the court, in assessing
                    the reasonableness of conclusive evidence clauses, should draw a distinction
                    between a case arising from a <em>commercial</em> context
                    and another arising from a <em>non-commercial</em> context.
                    In my view, this distinction may actually have some bearing on the outcome of
                    the present dispute since the Defendant is a private individual and not a
                    corporate entity (<em>cf</em> Chong J’s remarks in
                        <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> at [116]-[117], referenced
                    at [38] above). Unless and until significant and substantive legal submissions
                    are made in this specific regard, it would be inappropriate for this court to
                    delve into its own legal analysis on this potentially dispositive point at this
                    stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In sum, I find no cogent reason at the current
                    stage of the proceedings for this court to hold that clause 29.1 of the OSTA
                    Terms and Conditions precludes a finding that the Defendant “has a fair
                    case for defence or reasonable grounds for setting up a defence, or even a fair
                    probability that he has a <em>bona fide</em>
                    defence” (see <em>Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff v Indian
                        Bank</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [21]), or a finding that
                    “there is an issue of question in dispute which ought to be tried or that
                    there ought for some other reason to be a trial” (see O 14 r 3(1) ROC).
                    On the contrary, I find that there are serious questions that need to be tried
                    and addressed before a trial judge in order for the dispute between the parties
                    to be disposed of properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     For the reasons given above, the
