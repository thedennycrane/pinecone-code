<strong>Judgment</strong>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    In May 1997, Ricky Goh Chin Soon ("RG"), a successful

Singapore businessman, entered into discussions with a prominent Malaysian businessman, Dato Sng

Chee Hua ("Sng") for the purchase of 8 million shares (which would constitute 40% of

the equity) in a public listed company in Malaysia called "Seng Hup Corporation Bhd"

("Seng Hup"). One Mdm Flora Ong ("Flora")  a remisier with K&amp;N Kenanga

("Kenanga"), a firm of Malaysian stockbrokers  acted as the broker for both of them. RG

confirmed to Flora, at a meeting at the Marina Mandarin in Singapore on 12 May 1998, that he was

prepared to pay RM12 per share. By late May/early June 1997, the details of the sale at that price

and the details of how the sale was to be effected were agreed with Sng.

<p xmlns="">2.    Seng Hup (which also had outlets in Singapore known as "Crystal

Palace") was in the wholesale and retail lighting business. RG had himself started his

commercial career in the lighting business. It was clear that because of his familiarity with

that line of business RG, from the beginning, was favourably disposed towards acquiring Seng Hup

that were available for sale. Indeed, RG in his affidavit evidence-in-chief (paragraph 9) confirmed

that when he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"One of the reasons I was interested in this deal was because I started my

  career in the lighting and lightcraft wholesaling business myself. Therefore I was confident that

  if Seng Hup turned out to be a worthwhile company to takeover, I would be able to apply my

  considerable experience and success in this industry to run it profitably in the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">RG had also, at about the time of the arrangements to purchase the Seng Hup

shares, expressed confidence in his ability to successfully manage Seng Hup to a number of people.

He had also expressed the view that Seng Hup was currently not as profitable as it could be because

of internal mismanagement.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The financing of the Seng Hup acquisition</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">3.    To purchase the 8 million Seng Hup shares, RG needed considerable financial

assistance. From a very early stage CEF (Capital Markets) Ltd, a merchant bank based in Hong Kong

 through Leong Siew Loon ("Leong"), the executive director of its Singapore subsidiary,

CEF (Singapore) Ltd (referred to jointly as "CEF")  had expressed interest in financing

the purchase. It was RGs evidence that Leong had not only offered to finance the purchase but, in

addition, had said that CEF would provide RG with professional advice in respect of the purchase.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    CEF did not deny that it had, from the beginning, been interested in

financing the acquisition but denied that it had offered to give professional advice to RG in

respect of the acquisition. In this regard, it was pointed out that Seng Hup was a Malaysian

listed company and CEF had no licence to operate as a merchant bank in Malaysia.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    The total facilities that CEF undertook to procure for this transaction was

US$40 million. As there were internal constraints on CEF providing such a large sum of money, it was

agreed that CEF would provide US$25 million as a term loan and, in respect of the balance of US$15

million, would act as the facility agent to procure that loan.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    It was agreed between RG and Sng that the purchase of the 8 million

shares would be effected in two tranches. The first tranche of 4.3 million shares was to be crossed

through the Stock Exchange at RM14.50 per share and the balance of 3.7 million shares would be

crossed thereafter at about RM9 per share thereby maintaining the agreed price of RM12 per share.

City Square Development Ltd ("City Square"), a British Virgin Islands ("BVI")

company incorporated for that purpose, was the vehicle used to effect the purchase of the first

tranche.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    The crossing of the first tranche took place on 9 June 1997. To facilitate

the crossing CEF, on that day, issued a letter to Lum Chang Securities Pte Ltd ("Lum

Chang")  the stockbrokers used to effect the crossing  an undertaking that it would make

full payment for the shares by 27 June 1997. At the date of the crossing the formal documentation

relating to the loan and security to be provided had not been signed. The issue by Leong of the

letter of undertaking, without first having the formal documentation executed, was somewhat unusual.

Leongs explanation for this was that he had every confidence in RGs bona fides and accepted

the risk involved in issuing that letter of undertaking. The senior management of CEF, when

questioned, had reservations about the issue of that letter by Leong.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    The formal documentation for the loan was signed by the parties on 26 July

1997. Amongst the documents signed by RG and his nephew Danny Goh Teck Beng ("DG") on that

day were their respective letters of guarantee. Amongst the documents executed on behalf of City

Square were an Agency Fee Letter Agreement and a Front-End Fee Letter Agreement.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Problems with the financiers</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">9.    City Square failed to keep up with some of the payments that it was required

to make to CEF under the Agreements signed on 26 June 1997. On 29 July 1997, CEF made a formal

written demand for outstanding fees of US$328,938.20. City Square did not meet the demand. On 27

August 1997, CEF drew attention to cl 17 of the Facility Agreement which stipulated that upon the

occurrence of an event of default CEF could withdraw from its obligations to finance the purchase

and cautioned City Square that failure to pay outstanding fees was an event of default. As City

Square did not effect payment, CEF, on 8 September 1997, informed City Square that it was cancelling

all its commitments to City Square.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    Faced with the difficulties he was having with CEF, RG had to secure some

other method by which to finance the purchase of the second tranche of shares. Having purchased the

first tranche at an inflated price of RM14.50 per share, it was important to RG, in order to achieve

the average price of RM12 per share, that the purchase of the second tranche was completed. Only

then would the price paid for the Seng Hup shares average out to RM12 per share. To purchase the

second tranche, RG turned to one Andrew Quek ("Andrew")  a person very familiar with

share market operations  for assistance.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The "tango"</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">11.    RGs arrangement with Andrew was for Andrew to purchase the remaining

Seng Hup shares from Sng through Andrews trading account in a broking house and thereafter,

within each settlement period, keep transferring the shares back and forth between different trading

accounts. RG referred to this device as "tango". The idea was to keep on doing this until

the shares were paid for or otherwise disposed of. One of the other accounts into which the shares

were "tangoed" into was the account of one Wong Chin Yong ("Wong"), another

person highly conversant with share market operations. Using this device, RG obtained control of the

second tranche of Seng Hup shares (at RM12 per share) on 10 September 1997.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Trouble in Seng Hup: The AA Report</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">12.    Having obtained control of Seng Hup, RG appointed his nominees  amongst

whom were a prominent Malay politician and representatives from a firm called Credit Risk Management

("CRM")  to the Board of Seng Hup. The instrument appointing CRM was not produced but

it would appear that CRMs brief included an investigation into the way Seng Hup had been managed.

Towards that end, CRM, it would appear, began interviewing the employees of Seng Hup and soon after

reported to RG that there had been mismanagement in Seng Hups finances. No one from CRM was,

however, called to testify on all this. Nor did RG make disclosure (as he did in respect of AA) of

any report that CRM may have made.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    As a result of what CRM reported, Seng Hup appointed M/s Arthur Andersen

("AA"), a firm of public accountants in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), to conduct a position

audit on Seng Hup. AA conducted such an audit and, in December 1997, produced a position report on

the financial affairs of Seng Hup as at 30 September 1997 (AA Report). Meanwhile (in common

with many other counters on the Malaysian Stock Exchange), the price of Seng Hup shares on the Stock

Exchange was in decline. The evidence also was that on 9 September 1999, Seng Hup was placed

under Dhanaharta.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    It was RGs evidence that, from the later part of 1997, he began to

realise that he had been misled by Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF into buying the Seng Hup shares. It

also began to dawn on him, he said, that he had been the victim of a conspiracy amongst them to

defraud him. RG, however, did not take any immediate action against any of them for

misrepresentation or conspiracy.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The writs</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">15.    The first person to take legal proceedings in connection with the purchase

by RG of the Seng Hup shares was Flora. On 9 January 1998, Flora, in Suit No. 24/98, sued RG for her

2% commission.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    On 18 June 1998, CEF, by way of Suit No. 849/98, sued RG, DG, Grandlink

Group Pte Ltd and City Square (collectively referred to as "the RG Group") for,

inter alia, the return of the US$25 million loan advanced to City Square.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    On 3 June 1999, RG and City Square, in Suit No. 822/99, sued Sng for

breaches of warranties, misrepresentations and conspiracy (together with Flora, Leong and CEF) to

defraud RG in the acquisition of the Seng Hup shares. RG raised similar allegations of

misrepresentation and similar allegations of conspiracy to defraud by way of counterclaim against

Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF in Suits No. 24/99 and 849/98.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    With the declining fortune of Seng Hup, RG himself was facing increasing

financial difficulties. The commencement of Suit No. 849/98 by CEF for the sum of US$25 million

loaned to City Square did not help matters. In the course of this hearing, there was frequent

mention of RGs impending bankruptcy by reason of his failure to settle his debts. The judgments

entered against RG and the others referred to in paragraphs 27 and 34 below were precipitated by the

impending bankruptcy.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    The hearing of the claims and counterclaims in these suits was protracted

 it was spread over 13 months and it took 61 trial days  and the documents produced in court

were voluminous. Five different sets of solicitors represented the various parties involved and the

cross-examining of every witness was intensive and detailed.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    As was to be expected in such protracted proceedings involving different

interests, there was considerable differences in the accounts given by the various witnesses. To add

to that, in respect of some witnesses (and this applies particularly to RG, Eddie and Andrew), there

were considerable differences and contradictions even within their own evidence. Counsel for the

parties have, in their closing submissions, highlighted many of these contradictions.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    The evidence in support of the allegations of misrepresentation and

conspiracy to defraud made against CEF, Leong, Flora and Sng (the alleged conspirators) came mainly

from RG. As Mr Jimmy Yim, counsel for the RG Group, correctly stated in his closing submissions,

whether the court accepted those allegations or not would depend almost entirely on whether the

court believed RG or the alleged conspirators.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

A. <u>The claims against RG and his Group</u></p></b>.

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <u><i>The claims by Flora (Suit No. 24/98)</i></u></p></b>.

<p xmlns="">22.    In Suit No. 24/98, Flora claimed from RG the sum of RM1,920,000 being the

2% commission that RG had agreed to pay her for the purchase of the 8 million Seng Hup shares from

Sng. RG did not dispute that he had agreed to pay Flora a commission of 2% but alleged, first, that

the commission was for the purchase of 6.2 million and not 8 million Seng Hup shares and,

second, that, in any event he (RG) had not purchased any Seng Hup shares from Sng and therefore no

commission whatsoever was payable to Flora. In making this denial in Suit No. 24/98, RG was, no

doubt, relying on the fact that as it was City Square, a BVI company, that had purchased the first

tranche and as it was Andrew who had purchased the second tranche, Flora would have difficulty

tracing these purchases to him.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    In the Order 14 proceedings instituted in Suit No. 24/98, the Assistant

Registrar ("AR") rejected RGs claim that he had not purchased any shares from Sng and

gave part-judgment against RG in the sum of RM1,032,000 being the 2% commission in respect of the

first tranche of 4.3 million shares purchased through City Square. The AR granted RG unconditional

leave to defend Floras claim for commission in respect of the second tranche of 3.7 million

shares. Dissatisfied with that decision, RG appealed but the appeal was dismissed.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The changing defences</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">24.    On 1 September 1998, RG amended his Defence. In his Amended Defence he

admitted that he had bought 4.3 million Seng Hup shares through City Square but continued to deny

having bought the remaining 3.7 million shares. In this Amended Defence, RG counterclaimed against

Flora for:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the sum of $384,383.74 being the brokerage fees of Lum Chang for the 4.3

  million shares; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the sum of RM10,750,000 being the additional amount incurred by him in

  having purchased the 4.3 million shares from Sng at RM14.50 and not at the agreed price of RM12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It was significant that, even at this late stage  a period of almost a year

since RG (allegedly) began to realise that he had been defrauded by Sng, Flora, Leong and CEF 

RG, in the Amended Defence made no mention of any fraud.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    Another 7 months later, on 23 April 1999, RG filed a Re-Amended Defence and

Counterclaim. In this document, for the first time, RG alleged that he had purchased the 4.3 million

Seng Hup shares (in the name of City Square) as a result of fraudulent and/or negligent

representations about the affairs of Seng Hup made by Flora. RG further alleged that Flora had

fraudulently, in conspiracy with Sng, Leong and other persons unknown, induced him to purchase the

said shares. Again, it was of significance that RG continued to deny having purchased the

second tranche of 3.7 million shares.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    It was only on 25 February 2000  the 4<sup>th</sup> day after this

consolidated hearing commenced  that RG, through Mr Yim, came round to admitting that he had in

fact purchased the second tranche and that he had done so in the name of Andrew. Mr Andre Yeap,

counsel for CEF, submitted that this change of position came about because RG had, recently, been

compelled to disclose a considerable amount of documents relating to the purchase of Seng Hup shares

and, in the light of those disclosures, it was no longer feasible for RG to continue denying that he

had purchased the second tranche.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    On 26 May 2000, RG consented to judgment being entered against him for the

sum of RM888,000 (being commission at 2% on the second tranche of 3.7 million shares). In view of

the counterclaims that RG had against Flora that were still being pursued, it was, by consent,

agreed that the judgment against him was not to be enforced without leave of court.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    The counterclaims made against Flora were similar to the

counterclaims/claims made against CEF, Leong and Sng in the other suits. I will therefore deal with

these allegations and the counterclaims against CEF and Leong in Suit No. 849/98 together when

considering the claim against Sng in Suit No. 822/99.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The brokerage fee to Lum Chang</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">29.    In addition to the claims of misrepresentation and conspiracy, RG had, in

his counterclaim, claimed reimbursement from Flora of the sum of RM384,383.74 being the brokerage

charges paid to Lum Chang. The basis of this claim was that the 2% commission agreed with Flora

included brokerage fees.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Flora agreed that she had to absorb brokerage charges but claimed that this

would be so only if the transaction was put through Kenanga, the firm of brokers she worked for. It

was her case that since RG, without her consent (and even knowledge), had effected the sale through

Lum Chang, she was not liable to RG for Lum Changs brokerage charges.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    This claim for brokerage refund is not connected with RGs other claims

against Flora. I will therefore deal with this issue at this juncture. I found Floras evidence

that she would absorb the brokerage charges only if the transaction was put through the broking

house she worked for entirely credible and accepted that those were the terms of the agreement

reached with RG. I also accepted her evidence that from early June 1997 both RG and Sng kept her

entirely in the dark as to the progress of the sale. I therefore rejected RGs claim for

reimbursement of the brokerage fees paid to Lum Chang.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(b) <u><i>The claims by CEF (Suit No. 849/98)</i></u></p></b>.

<p xmlns="">32.    In this suit brought by CEF against members of the RG Group, the claim

against City Square was for:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) the sum of US$25 million and interest thereon amounting to US$1,200,463.19

  as at 31 March 1998;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the unpaid balance of the Front-End Fee amounting to US$384,938.20 under

  the Facility Agreement and/or the Front-End Fee Letter Agreement;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Agency Fee of US$20,000; and</p>
<p align="justify">(4) Commitment Fee of US$11,562.10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The claims against RG and DG were based on the personal guarantees that each had

given. The claim against Grandlink was in respect of a cheque for US$256,713.19, dated 17 January

1998, issued by Grandlink in favour of CEF which when presented for payment was dishonoured.

Grandlink was the company used by RG as a holding company for some of his property development

businesses in Singapore.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Forgery</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">33.    In their joint Defence, the RG Group alleged that the signature of one Yap

Yew Hock ("Yap") appearing on the Agency Fee and Front- End Fee Agreements, purportedly on

behalf of City Square, was not the signature of Yap but was a forgery. That being so City Square was

not liable for the Agency Fee and the Front-End Fee claimed. In respect of the US$25 million, it was

pleaded that City Square had not drawn down on this sum under the Facility Agreement but that CEF

had, without the authority of City Square, unilaterally paid the amount to Lum Chang pursuant to the

written assurance given by CEF to Lum Chang on 9 June 1997. City Square was not therefore

liable to repay the US$25 million.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    I would, at this stage, point out that the RG Group made no effort to

substantiate the serious allegations of forgery that they had made against CEF. Instead, on 22 May

2000  the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of the trial  RG, City Square and Grandlink, through Mr Yim,

admitted the claims made by CEF and judgment was entered against them. As in the case of Suit

No. 24/98, in view of the on-going counterclaims, it was agreed that the judgment was not to be

executed without leave.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    The counterclaims in Suit No. 849/98 raised allegations of fraudulent

misrepresentation, conspiracy and negligence against CEF and against Leong personally. As these

issues overlapped similar issues raised as against Flora in Suit No. 24/98 and Sng in Suit No.

822/99, I will, as indicated earlier, deal with them together.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

B. <u>The claims/counterclaims by the RG Group</u></p></b>.

<p xmlns="">36.    In Suit No. 822/99, RG and City Square alleged that Sng had made

fraudulent/negligent misrepresentations regarding the commercial viability of Seng Hup; that he had

conspired with CEF, Leong and Flora to defraud RG and that he was in breach of the written

warranties contained in his letter dated 27 May 1997 ("the letter of warranty") addressed

to RG.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.    In Suit No. 849/98, RG, by way of counterclaim, made similar allegations

against Flora, Leong and CEF and sought damages. As against Leong and CEF, RG also made a

counterclaim for breach of their duty of care to him in the professional advice they rendered

vis--vis the acquisition.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Breach of warranties</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">38.    I will deal first with the claims against Sng based on the letter of

warranty. The letter stated:</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Paragraph 3 of the letter suggests that the warranties were given in lieu of an

earlier obligation to afford RG an opportunity to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. That

was in fact so. The history of how this letter of warranty came to be given was as follows.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Warranties in lieu of due diligence</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">39.    On 16 May 1997, as a follow-up to the meeting at the Marina Mandarin, RG

had sent a letter to Sng confirming his (RGs) interest in buying 6.2 million Seng Hup shares at

not more than RM12 per share "subject to our having undertaken a due-diligence to our

satisfaction on the accounts and business of the company". Leong, at RGs request, had helped

RG draft that letter. Seng Hup was a public listed company. As such, disclosing to an intending

purchaser of Seng Hup shares, information relating to the affairs of Seng Hup that was not in the

public domain, or giving an intending purchaser access to the books of Seng Hup for the purpose of

conducting a due diligence exercise could meet with difficulties. Leong, who was aware of these

difficulties, nevertheless inserted the proviso relating to due diligence. In effect, he told the

court that he did this in order to give RG an escape route should the need arise.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    Yeo Siah Meng ("Yeo") the then Managing Director of CEF (Hong

Kong), when cross-examined by Mr Yim also confirmed that a purchaser of shares, even a large block

of shares, in a public listed company would not be allowed access to the companys books of

account. It was Yeos evidence that an intending purchaser of shares in a public listed company

would have to rely primarily on the published information and published accounts of the company. The

only protection that such a purchaser could expect would be such warranties that the vendor was

prepared to give.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    On 25 May 1997, Sng, in response to a request by Eddie, had sent a fax to

RG and Eddie wherein Sng had confirmed that the profit before tax of Seng Hup as at 31 March 1997

was "within RM3 million". In that fax, Sng stated that he could not disclose the

(exact) year-end results that had been asked for because the results had not been disclosed to the

Stock Exchange. Sng, however, in the letter, assured RG that he (Sng) would be responsible for any

shortfall. (This was also one of the warranties that Sng was alleged to have breached).</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    When Leong saw, from the letter of 25 May 1997, the willingness of Sng to

give assurances in lieu of making disclosures prohibited by the Stock Exchange, Leong felt that it

would be in RGs interest (and hence CEFs interests) to exact more warranties from Sng.

In consultation with RG and Eddie, he drafted a list of warranties to be given by Sng in lieu

of his giving RG an opportunity to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. The letter of

warranty sent by Sng contained the draft warranties that Leong had helped to draft.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Were warranties breached</p></b></u>?

<p xmlns="">43.    In order to succeed in his claim, RG would have to prove that Sng was in

breach of the warranties contained in the letter. RG, by his pleadings (paragraph 24 of the

Statement of Claim) sought to rely on the AA Report to provide this proof. To adduce the AA Report

as evidence, the makers of that Report would have to be called as witnesses. At the time the hearing

commenced, no arrangements had been put in place by RG for this to be done. Nor were any

arrangements made for any other accountant or person familiar with the financial affairs of Seng

Hup, to be called to testify on the accuracy or otherwise of the representations and warranties in

question. What RG sought to do, instead, was to prove the breach of the representations and

warranties by incorporating the AA Report as part of his evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.    CEF, Leong, Flora and Sng all objected to the admission of the AA Report.

They objected on grounds of:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <u>relevance</u></p>
<p align="justify">The AA Report was a report on the state of affairs of Seng Hup as at 31

  September 1997. It was not a report of the financial affairs of Seng Hup for the period relevant

  to the issues in this case, ie the period in respect of which the representations and warranties

  were given. The Report was therefore irrelevant; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) <u>admissibility</u></p>
<p align="justify">In the absence of direct testimony from the makers of the Report the contents

  of the Report were hearsay and inadmissible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was merit in both these objections. I indicated to Mr Yim that if he wanted

to have the AA Report admitted in evidence he would have to apply for leave to call the person/s

from AA who prepared the report to testify in these proceedings.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Application to call Teoh</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">45.    On 7 March 2000  the 11<sup>th</sup> day of the trial  by way of SIC

No. 601130/2000, Mr Yim applied for leave to file the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Teoh Soo

Hock ("Teoh") of AA. Teoh was one of the authors of the AA Report. Affidavits in support

of the applications were filed. Mr Yim told the court that because Seng Hup had been placed under

Dhanaharta on 9 September 1999 and Dhanaharta had refused its consent for AA to testify about the

affairs of Seng Hup, RG had not been able to call Teoh as a witness. Mr Yim went on to say that

Dhanaharta had now given its consent and RG could now call Teoh as a witness. Mr Yim further

submitted that as discovery of the AA Report had already been made to all the parties, there would

be no prejudice to anyone by reason of this late application to call Teoh.</p>
<p xmlns="">46.    Counsel for Sng, Flora, CEF and Leong ("the alleged

conspirators") all objected to the application. The gist of their objection was that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) they had, all along, been led to believed that RG was not calling AA or any

  other accountant to testify on the affairs of AA. In that belief, they had aborted all efforts to

  retain their own experts to study the AA Report. To allow RG to call Teoh at this late stage would

  therefore be prejudicial to them;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) if the AA Report was admitted discovery would have to be made of all

  documents that form the basis of the AA Report so that the experts (to be appointed) could

  meaningfully look into the matter. This would cause considerable delay to this trial;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) RG had claimed that he could not procure the attendance of Teoh earlier

  because Dhanaharta would not give its "consent", but, apart from the say-so of RG,

  nothing in the affidavits filed in support of the application  not even the affidavit of Teoh

   reflected this. The "consent" that was produced  dated 18 February 2000 

  was not signed by Dhanaharta but was signed by RG himself as "CEO and Director"

  of Seng Hup. Also, there was no evidence before the court as to why RG could not have

  procured this "consent" before Dhanaharta came into the picture; and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) the AA Report reflected Seng Hups affairs as at 30 September 1997.

  That date had no relevance to these proceedings. If the Report was admitted, questions of

  causation and novus actus intervenus caused by the economic downturn in the second half of 1997

  would also arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was merit in the submission on behalf of the alleged conspirators that this

"surprise" calling of Teoh as a witness would cause them prejudice and might further

prolong this already long trial. But that prejudice had to be weighed against the difficulties that

RG had faced in procuring the attendance of Teoh, the importance of the evidence of Teoh to RGs

case and the prejudice to RG should the application be disallowed. The submission that the Report,

being a report of the position of Seng Hup as at 30 September 1997, would be of no relevance to the

issues in this case could also have merit, but, without hearing what Teoh had to say, it would be

premature to accept that submission.</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    The affidavits filed in support of this application were, however, not

sufficiently precise for me to be able to say that RG, up to then, had been unable to call Teoh

because Dhanaharta had refused to consent. If that was indeed the reason, RG should be able, without

much difficulty, to produce documentary evidence to support that assertion. At the very least Teoh,

or someone from AA, could testify that it was because Dhanaharta refused to consent that AA could

not agree to testify on behalf of RG. I granted RG leave to file a further affidavit/s to address

this issue.</p>
<p xmlns="">48.    On 17 March 2000, Mr Yim addressed the court again on this matter. He had

by then obtained another affidavit from Teoh. However, nowhere in that affidavit did Teoh state, in

so many words, that it was because of the refusal by Dhanaharta to give its consent that Teoh/AA had

so far been unable to testify. Because of the importance to RGs case that he adduce credible

evidence to show that the written warranties given by Sng and the other representations allegedly

made by Sng and the others were untrue, I allowed RG a further opportunity to satisfy me that the

failure, up to then, to arrange for Teoh/AA to testify was not due to any fault of RG.</p>
<p xmlns="">49.    However, even by 2 August 2000, no further affidavits were filed by RG. The

uncertainty about whether leave would or would not be granted to RG to call Teoh as a witness was

causing difficulties in the cross-examination of witnesses. In the circumstances, as RG had not

satisfied me that the failure to call Teoh earlier was not through any fault of his, I dismissed RGs

application in Suit No. 601130/2001.</p>
<p xmlns="">50.    I do not know to what extent the AA Report and the evidence of Teoh would

have helped in proving that the alleged representations/warranties were misleading or false but the

position at the close of the hearing was that there was insufficient credible evidence before me for

me to find that Sng had breached any of the terms in the letter of warranty. This was also so in

respect of the other representations allegedly made by Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF.</p>
<p xmlns="">51.    The failure to adduce satisfactory evidence of the affairs of Seng Hup also

meant that even if Flora, Sng, Leong and CEF had made the representations complained about, there

was no evidence on which the court could conclude that these representations were untrue. In this

case, however, I was not satisfied that, in the first place, such representations had been made by

them and, even if made, that RG had relied on those representations in deciding to buy the Seng Hup

shares.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

RGs credibility</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">52.    RG came through to me as a person who had scant regard for the truth. The

contradictory positions he took in trying to defend himself from the claim for commission brought

against him by Flora was sufficient by itself to show that he was a person who, when it came to

protecting his self-interest, had no compunctions about taking any position that would achieve that

end regardless of the truth of that position. A perusal of the record will show numerous instances

of RGs evasiveness. Even his counsel, Mr Yim, conceded, in his closing submissions (paragraph

219) that there were various inconsistencies in RGs evidence and that RG was sometimes evasive.</p>
<p xmlns="">53.    The fact that RG was shown to be prevaricating in some aspects of the case

does not, of course, mean that his entire evidence must be rejected outright. I accepted Mr Yims

submission (based on the case of <i>Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock</i> <nobr>[1996] 3 SLR 431</nobr>) that the mere

fact that the credit of a witness had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence

would be disregarded. I accepted that it was the duty of the court to scrutinise the whole of the

evidence to determine what was true and what was not. But the shifts in position by RG in this case

were so drastic that his general credibility was put in doubt. The situation was not helped  to

cite just the two instances referred to above  by his allegation that CEF had forged the

signature of Yap on two documents but calling no evidence to support that allegation or by his

assertion that he could not call Teoh to testify because Dhanaharta had refused consent but

producing no evidence to support this assertion. But even so, in assessing the evidence of RG (and

the other witnesses), I bore in mind that it did not follow that where a witness had told untruths

or been evasive or contradicted himself on some material points, that witness was necessarily not to

be believed in the rest of his evidence.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Flora</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">54.    Flora, Sng, Leong and the other officers from CEF, when compared with RG,

came through as truthful witnesses. Although RG tried to paint Flora as a conspirator, who, with the

others, had defrauded him, I accepted Floras evidence that her role was no more than that of a

middleman who, for a fee, was putting a seller and a buyer together. I accepted her evidence

that she made no representations to RG about the financial viability of Seng Hup and that she had

not, at the Marina Mandarin meeting, produced any accounts of Seng Hup. I accepted her evidence

that, in any event, she did not, at the Marina Mandarin meeting, have to "sell" Seng Hup

to RG because RG (and Eddie) had, prior to that meeting, spoken to her on the phone and she knew

from those conversations that RG was keen to buy the shares at RM12 per share. I was satisfied

that nothing that Flora may have said, either at the Marina Mandarin meeting or elsewhere, had the

effect of influencing RG to buy the Seng Hup shares.</p>
<p xmlns="">55.    I also accepted the evidence of Flora that from early June 1997, both RG

and Sng kept her in the dark as to what was happening and that she did not get to know, until much

later, that the shares had been sold to RG. The allegations of conspiracy and misrepresentation made

against Flora by RG were, in my view, nothing but self-serving conjecture.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Sng</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">56.    Although Sng was a major shareholder of Seng Hup, he was not on the Board

of Seng Hup. Sngs interest in Seng Hup was only as a stock player. He had himself purchased the

bulk of the shares he sold to RG only a short while before the agreement to sell them to RG. As Sng

had no interest in getting involved in the management of Seng Hup, he had allowed the existing Board

of Directors to continue to be in office even after acquiring such a large portfolio.</p>
<p xmlns="">57.    There was evidence that Sng, at a dinner hosted by RG in late May 1997, had

said to those present (including RG) "Come, let us make some money"; and there was

evidence that Sng had taken trading advantage of the fact that RG was about to buy 40% of the

paid-up capital of a public listed company. He no doubt also took trading advantage of the fact that

the first tranche was to be transacted at a price considerably higher than the RM12 that had been

agreed and the second tranche at a lower price. Indeed, there was evidence that DG, RG himself,

Eddie and Andrew, were also indulging in the trading of Seng Hup shares from around early June 1997.</p>
<p xmlns="">58.    There was evidence that Sng had given the profits he made in one lot of his

earlier trades in Seng Hup shares to Flora. It was suggested that this showed that Sng and Flora

were working together to defraud RG. I rejected that suggestion. I accepted the evidence of Flora

and Sng that this reflected no more than a gift from Sng to Flora for having procured the sale of

Sngs shares. It did not, in the circumstances, indicate the existence of any conspiracy between

Sng and Flora to defraud RG.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.    I accepted Sngs evidence that RG, because of his previous history of

trading in lighting equipment, was keen to acquire the 8 million Seng Hup shares and that, save for

the written warranties and assurances he had given, Sng had not made any other representations to RG

to induce RG to buy the shares. I was satisfied that RG bought the Seng Hup shares because of his

desire to get back into a business he was experienced in and in his confidence in his own ability to

successfully manage Seng Hup.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

CEF and Leong</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">60.    I take CEF and Leong together because the allegation of misrepresentation,

conspiracy and negligence against CEF arose mainly from what Leong  an employee of CEF  did or

did not do.</p>
<p xmlns="">61.    The allegation of conspiracy against CEF and Leong was, as in the case of

similar allegations against Sng and Flora, completely without merit. It seemed to me that RG had

thought up these allegations merely as a device to delay the proceedings taken against him.</p>
<p xmlns="">62.    The allegations of misrepresentation too were without foundation. There was

no doubt that Leong was in close contact with Eddie and RG at the time RG decided to buy the Seng

Hup shares but, to say that RG bought the shares as a result of any representation Leong made

would, in my assessment, be a misrepresentation of the truth. It seemed to me, that if at all

anyone had encouraged RG to buy the Seng Hup shares, that person was not Leong but Eddie.</p>
<p xmlns="">63.    It was clear to me that RG decided to buy the controlling interests in Seng

Hup because </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) it suited RGs business needs to have a public listed company into which

  he could inject some of his assets;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the lighting business was one which RG was familiar with. He was also

  familiar with the way in which the existing management of Seng Hup had conducted its business and

  had full confidence in his own ability to make a success of Seng Hup;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) there was some symbiosis between RGs main line of business as a property

  developer (in Singapore, Malaysia and China) and Seng Hups business in light fittings; and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) the price of RM12 per share seemed to him to be a fair price to pay for a

  controlling interest in Seng Hup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I accepted Leongs evidence that his main role was in the processing,

structuring and securitisation of the massive loan that CEF was to make to RG. I accepted Leongs

evidence that he had, at no stage, told RG or Eddie that CEF would provide professional advice in

the acquisition. Indeed, the unchallenged evidence before the court was that CEF was not a licensed

merchant bank in Malaysia and could not have provided such advice in respect of a Malaysian listed

company. If CEF had wanted to assume the role of professional advisor to RG in the acquisition,

CEF would have had to work with a merchant bank in Malaysia.</p>
<p xmlns="">64.    It would be relevant to note that just prior to the Seng Hup acquisition,

CEF had acted for RG in RGs attempt to acquire a controlling interest of a public listed company

in Hong Kong called "Poly Investments Holdings Ltd" ("Poly"). That attempt

proved abortive because, in RGs words, "the price of the Poly shares on the Hong Kong market

had risen too high by mid-May 1997". In respect of the Poly deal, the letter of offer from CEF

to RG clearly spelt out that CEF would finance the acquisition and provide acquisition advice.

Although some internal documents of CEF made reference to the giving of advice to RG, the letter of

offer sent to RG (albeit sent only after the first tranche had been crossed) referred only to

financing the acquisition and made no reference to the giving of acquisition advice.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.    Leong did not deny that he did assist RG in drafting some letters and in

drafting the letter of warranty. He claimed that he did this because RG sought his assistance and,

as these were matters within his competence, he could not reasonably refuse assistance. In any

event, it was as important to CEF as financiers (since CEF was granting the loans, inter alia, on

the security of the Seng Hup shares being purchased) as it was to RG that the purchase should be on

terms as favourable to RG as possible. Leong therefore considered the help he gave to RG in these

matters as part of his duties to CEF as financiers of the intended purchase. Similarly, when Eddie

at the last minute asked him to go in his place to meet Sng in Kuala Lumpur, Leong obliged since he

had not, up till then, met Sng and he felt that such a meeting would be of benefit to CEF in

assessing the bona fides of Sng as the vendor of such a large block of shares. Whilst in Kuala

Lumpur, Leong made some enquiries from Sng on matters that RG and Eddie had asked him to.</p>
<p xmlns="">66.    I rejected RGs claim that it was Leong who decided on the pricing of the

two tranches of shares. RG claimed that Leong had advised on this price strategy in order to

generate market interest in Seng Hup shares. I accepted Leongs evidence  and this was

supported by the evidence of Eddie  that he (Leong) had nothing to do with pricing strategy. I

accepted that Leong was no market player and was not involved in any market rigging exercise. The

other persons surrounding RG, namely Eddie, Andrew and Wong were, on the other hand, seasoned market

players and, if at all anyone advised RG on pricing stratagem, it would have been one or more of

them.</p>
<p xmlns="">67.    I accepted Leongs evidence that when he learnt that the second tranche

was to be traded at a price considerably lower than the first tranche, he felt that in order to

protect CEFs (and incidentally RGs) interest it would be critical to ensure that the sale of

the second tranche did take place. To ensure this Leong arranged for Bayerische Landesbank, who were

holding the 3.7 million shares comprised in the second tranche, to give an undertaking to RGs

solicitors that that 3.7 million shares would be transacted at the lower price. There was nothing

negligent or improper in this conduct of Leong. To the contrary, that undertaking benefited RG as

much as it did CEF.</p>
<p xmlns="">68.    It was the evidence of RG that Leong went to Kuala Lumpur to conduct a due

diligence exercise on Seng Hup and that when Leong returned he informed RG that the Seng Hups

finances were in order. I accepted Leongs evidence on the circumstances that led to his

Kuala Lumpur trip. I accepted his evidence that he had at no stage undertaken or been asked to

undertaken a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup. I accepted his evidence that, in any event, it

would have been impossible to perform such an exercise on just a one-day trip to Kuala Lumpur. I

accepted Leongs evidence that he did not, at any stage whether before or after the Kuala Lumpur

trip, assure RG that the finances of Seng Hup were in order or involve himself on the question of

what the price for the purchase of the shares should be.</p>
<p xmlns="">69.    I also find that RG  with his fairly extensive commercial experience 

knew that it would not be possible for a purchaser of shares in a public listed company to do an

effective due diligence exercise on that company. I also find that RG knew, at the time he purchased

the Seng Hup shares, that CEF had not carried out a due diligence exercise on his behalf on Seng

Hup. This was obvious from the letter of warranty sent to RG by Sng  well before the first

crossing  in which Sng stated that he was giving the warranties in lieu of the due diligence

exercise.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Negligence</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">70.    It was also RGs case that even if CEF had not represented to RG that

they would be the professional advisors in the Seng Hup acquisition, Leong had voluntarily assumed

this role and therefore Leong and CEF (as the employer of Leong) would be liable to RG for

negligence in connection with that role.</p>
<p xmlns="">71.    In support of the above submission, Mr Yim referred to various authorities

beginning with the celebrated case of <i>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Pnrs Ltd</i>

[1964] AC 465 at 467. The principles laid down in those cases were, however, not in issue. What was

in issue was whether Leong had fallen foul of those principles.</p>
<p xmlns="">72.    It may well be that Leong, in helping RG draft some of the documents, took

on an advisory role or at least could have led RG to believe that he was acting in an advisory role.

If it can be shown that, in respect of those matters on which RG had relied on the advice of

Leong, RG suffered a loss because Leong had been negligent in his advice, then Leong (and CEF)

may be liable in damages to RG. However, that did not happen in this case.</p>
<p xmlns="">73.    I am satisfied that Leong did not give any advice to RG relating to RGs

commercial decision to buy the Seng Hup shares at RM12 per share. That was a matter in the province

of RG and Eddie. Leong also played no part in the pricing strategy for the two tranches.</p>
<p xmlns="">74.    Leongs role in drafting the letter of 16 May 1997 and his role in

drafting the letter of warranty were amongst the acts of Leong which were highlighted as providing

evidence of the advisory role that Leong had undertaken. Leong and CEF have contended that in

drafting these letters Leong was acting to protect CEFs interests as financiers but even if one

accepts that Leong, nevertheless, had taken on the mantle of advisor on these matters to RG, there

could be a cause of action against Leong only if it could be shown that Leong was negligent in what

he did.</p>
<p xmlns="">75.    Leong admitted playing a role in ensuring that the offer by RG to purchase

the shares was subject to due diligence. But, as noted earlier, it was not really feasible to do an

effective due diligence exercise on a public listed company. Even Mr Yim recognised this difficulty

when, in reference to Sngs claim that Sng had obtained the unaudited internal accounts of Seng

Hup, Mr Yim said (at page 210 of his submissions):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Internal interim accounts of a public company is highly price sensitive

  information and no management team, mindful of their fiduciary duties, would ever disclose this to

  anyone, let alone a shareholder who was thinking of disposing of his shares!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">To the extent that a seller cannot have access to price-sensitive information, a

buyer too cannot have access to such information.</p>
<p xmlns="">76.    The reality therefore was that by subjecting the intended purchase of Seng

Hup shares to a right for RG to conduct a due diligence exercise on Seng Hup and then trading that

(rather ineffective) right for warranties given by Sng, Leong was able to procure for RG a degree of

protection that RG would not otherwise have had: such acts could hardly be described as negligent.</p>
<p xmlns="">77.    In his closing submissions, Mr Yim detailed a whole host of other acts done

by Leong which, he submitted, went towards showing that Leong was rendering advisory services. Even

if that was so, it does not assist RG in his claim against Leong (and CEF) because none of these

acts, either alone or in combination, could be, in my view, characterised as negligent. Nor was

it established that RG relied on the advise of RG in his decision to purchase the Seng Hup shares.</p>
<p xmlns="">78.    It was also suggested that in failing to warn RG about the risks of

purchasing shares without carrying out a due diligence, Leong and CEF were in breach of their duty

of care to RG. In response to this suggestion, Mr Alvin Tan, counsel for Leong, submitted that the

risk that one runs in buying anything without carrying out proper checks was so obvious that the

duty suggested  that Leong should have warned RG of such risks  did not accord with common

sense. I accepted that submission. Any person involved in commercial transactions, to the extent

that RG was, would have known of the risks involved in buying shares of a company. I did not

consider that  to adopt the words of Lord Bridge in <i>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman &amp; Ors</i>

[1990] 2 AC 605)  it was "fair, just and reasonable" that the law should in this

case impose a duty on Leong to specifically warn RG of such obvious risks.</p>
<p xmlns="">79.    For the above reasons, I gave judgment against DG in Suit No.

849/98 and dismissed with costs the claims by RG and City Square against Sng in Suit No.

822/99; the counterclaim by RG against Flora in Suit No. 24/98; and the counterclaims by the RG

Group against CEF and Leong in Suit No. 849/98.</p>
