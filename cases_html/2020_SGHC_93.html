The plaintiff did not adduce any objective direct evidence to corroborate his claim, such as voice or video recordings of the oral negotiations. There were also no proper minutes of the meetings. As will be seen below, the plaintiff relied solely on subjective testimony of various witnesses and circumstantial evidence.

There is a chance that parties may forget one of those 12 terms, in addition to the risk that parties may easily renege or deny such an agreement. This decreases the likelihood that parties would intend to enter a legally binding contract of 12 terms simply orally, especially on a matter of such importance.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether there was a precise point where agreement was reached</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The plaintiff had been unable to prove a particular point in time in which agreement was in fact reached, despite offering many inconsistent positions as to when the agreement was allegedly reached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The plaintiff’s position vacillated a significant number of times.

</div>
</div> I found it unnecessary to deal in depth with these foreign cases and materials because, as will be further seen below, the offer and acceptance analysis is well established in Singapore, even for oral agreements and continuing negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Tai Ping </span>provided strong support for the plaintiff’s proposition, stating that the traditional analysis of offer and acceptance is not helpful in the case of continuing negotiations (at [16] to [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 In the present case, the parties were involved in continuing negotiations… over a period of time. In such cases, the traditional analysis of offer and acceptance is not really helpful in determining the true position. In this regard, we agree with the observation expressed by Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Port Sudan Cotton Co v Govindaswamy Chettiar &amp; Sons</span> [1977] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 5 [(“<span class="font-italic">Port </span><span class="font-italic">Sudan</span>”)] at 10:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I do not much like the analysis in the text-books of inquiring whether there was an offer and acceptance, or a counter-offer, and so forth. I prefer to examine the whole of the documents in the case and decide from them whether the parties did reach an agreement upon all material terms in such circumstances that the proper inference is that they agreed to be bound by those terms from that time onwards.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">His Lordship repeated, in substance, his observation in <span class="font-italic">Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd</span> [1979] 1 All ER 965 where he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I have much sympathy with the judge’s approach to this case. In many of these cases our traditional analysis of offer, counter-offer, rejection, acceptance and so forth is out-of-date... The better way is to look at all the documents passing between the parties and glean from them, or from the conduct of the parties, whether they have reached agreement on all material points, even though there may be differences between the forms and conditions printed on the back of them.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 A similar view was also expressed in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> vol 1 (27th Ed, 1994) at para 2-017:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Continuing negotiations. When parties carry on lengthy negotiations, it may be hard to say exactly when an offer has been made and accepted. As negotiations progress, each party may make concessions or new demands and the parties may in the end disagree as to whether they had ever agreed at all. <span class="font-italic">The court must then look at the whole correspondence and decide whether, on its true construction, the parties had agreed to the same terms. If so, there is a contract even though both parties, or one of them, had reservations not expressed in the correspondence.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 However, despite the Court of Appeal’s seeming eschewal of the offer and acceptance model, they had effectively still applied the offer and acceptance model on the facts of the case, finding that there were multiple offers made which was finally accepted via a crucial acceptance document made on a specific date, 31 March 1999:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 … Finally the parties met on 9 March 1999. At that meeting, Mr Ong requested for an increase in the amount offered by Tai Ping. No agreement was reached at the meeting. Thereafter, sometime near the end of March 1999, Douglas again requested Mr Li to increase the amount. On 31 March 1999, Tai Ping wrote to OCW as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We refer to the previous correspondence and discussion in the above connection.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are pleased to advise that we agree to adjust the proportion borned [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] by Insured under Section II, from 30% to 20% of the loss. After adjustment, the final figure payable is S$553,560.98. We enclose herewith a Discharge for your onward transmission for Insured’s signature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 … Viewed against that background, it is abundantly clear to us that by the letter of 31 March 1999, Tai Ping agreed to increase the payment to $553,560.98 sought by PPL in settlement of their claim. In our judgment, with the receipt of that letter the parties had arrived at a clear compromise on the amount to be paid in settlement of PPL’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Hence, despite the remarks in <span class="font-italic">Tai </span><span class="font-italic">Ping</span>, the court still found that there was a precise point where the acceptance was given, which was the letter on 31 March 1999. This was consistent with the offer and acceptance model. The remarks hence did not represent departure from the offer and acceptance model.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 This issue was subsequently discussed again by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(above at [30]), where the court stated that the flexible approach was radical, and that the traditional offer and acceptance model was the approach in Singapore (at [62] to [63]). The court observed (at [63]) that in <span class="font-italic">Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation (England) Ltd</span> [1979] 1 WLR 401, Lord Denning MR was alone in advocating the flexible approach, whereas the majority adopted the traditional offer and acceptance analysis. It further noted that Lord Denning MR himself had endorsed the traditional approach, despite advocating the flexible approach (at [63]). The Court of Appeal also noted that the flexible approach “has not really found favour with the [UK] courts and… appear to have been all but rejected” by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Gibson v Manchester City Council</span> [1979] 1 WLR 294 (at [63]). The Court of Appeal then concluded that the traditional offer and acceptance model should still apply, but less dogmatically, by considering the context in which the agreement was concluded, and examining the whole course of negotiations (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whilst it is true that the court concerned must examine the whole course of negotiations between the parties (see above at [53]), this should be effected in accordance with the concepts of offer and acceptance. What <span class="font-italic">is</span> required, however, is a less mechanistic or dogmatic application of these concepts and this can be achieved by having regard to the <span class="font-italic">context</span> in which the agreement was concluded. Looked at in this light, the traditional approach is not, in substance at least, that different from the broad approach advocated by Lord Denning. Indeed, the traditional approach is probably the approach that has hitherto been adopted in the Singapore context (see, for example, the Singapore Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">The Master Stelios</span> [1983–1984] SLR(R) 26 as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Pac-Asian Service Pte Ltd v Westburne International Drilling Ltd</span> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 588) and, as just mentioned, we see no reason why it should not continue to be adopted (albeit with the context of the contract always being borne in mind). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The High Court in various local cases have also accepted that an agreement comes into being as an event, not a process, and there has to be a single point in time when the necessary consensus <span class="font-italic">ad idem </span>is reached (<span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 68 (“<span class="font-italic">PNG</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [149]; <span class="font-italic">Lipkin International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 962 (“<span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I accepted the guidance from these cases<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a flexible approach does not require departure from the offer and acceptance model, but simply requires a deeper appreciation of the context of the agreement, by looking through the whole course of negotiations. This can also be seen in the authorities relied on by the plaintiff. In Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">Treitel: The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2015) at para 2-017, it was observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Continuing Negotiations … The court will then look at the entire course of the negotiations to decide whether an apparently unqualified acceptance did in fact conclude the agreement. If it did, the fact that the parties continued negotiations after this point will not normally affect the existence of the contract… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The text supported that an unqualified acceptance was necessary, and that there is a point where a contract is formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Having a precise point of formation is also important for many other reasons. The time of formation affects important matters such as the limitation period for contractual actions, the time when obligations begin and the time of expiry of contract. Without a point of formation, it would be impossible for the court to determine these auxiliary matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This requirement is also necessary in order to give commercial certainty to the parties that their continuing negotiations would not be taken to be a binding contract unless there was a clear acceptance at some point in time. There are two competing interests at play which have to be balanced. On one hand, the court needs to protect the party who subjectively views that there is a contract, and acts in reliance on this contract. On the other hand, the court needs to ensure that the other party who subjectively views that he is merely engaging in negotiations is not unfairly bound by a contract he did not subjectively intend to enter. The balance between these interests is met by requiring the plaintiff to be able to adduce some objective document or fact to objectively show that an agreement was definitively reached at a particular point. This could be as simple as a text stating “I agree to your terms”, or a phone call saying that “I accept”, or in some cases, based on the context, even a handshake at the end of a meeting. It is not desirable nor sufficient for a plaintiff to pool together a universe of emails, messages and conduct, and argue that the collective sum of these show that an agreement must have had been reached, without showing when the definitive point was. The court’s readiness to conjure up a binding contract from a series of equivocal negotiations and subsequent conduct may encourage litigation by hopefuls, and also create commercial uncertainty amongst parties engaging in negotiation. As the plaintiff rightly pointed out, continuing negotiations can be complicated, making it difficult to ascertain the subjective intentions of parties, which is precisely why the requirement of a precise point of agreement is needed to provide certainty as to when a court will find a negotiation to have crystallised into an agreement. It provides more certainty for the court to draw a clear a line, and for parties to strive to meet that standard, than for the court to have such a flexible standard that parties never know when it is met in each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Before addressing whether the plaintiff’s numerous alternative submissions proved a precise point of formation, I will first briefly address some issues on pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Whether the pleadings were reasonably certain as to the date of formation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The defendants argued in their written closing submissions that the plaintiff’s pleadings were not reasonably certain as to the date of formation, since they merely stated that the agreement was made over the course of October 2011 to October 2012 (see also above at [30], [38]).

</div> The plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>”), amongst other cases, for these propositions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agreed with the defendants, and found that the requirement to plead a reasonably certain date of formation is a necessary corollary of the requirement that a contract has a precise point of agreement. The date must be pleaded with reasonable certainty to set the scope of the issue contested, and to give fair notice to the other party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I agreed that the plaintiff’s pleadings were not reasonably certain and could have justified a striking out before commencement of the trial. In <span class="font-italic">Lipkin </span>([46] above), the court struck out the plaintiff’s pleadings, finding that it was unarguable to plead that the oral contract was concluded over a two-month period, and that it was vexatious for the plaintiff to experiment by pleading different dates and different bases for the same contract (at [42], [49]). In <span class="font-italic">PNG </span>([46] above), it was held that pleadings identifying a 20 day period as the time where the agreement was formed was not reasonably certain (at [149]). <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, in this case, it was untenable for the plaintiff to plead that the oral agreement was formed over a year. Indeed, a striking out action may have had saved both parties significant amounts of costs and time. The vagueness led to extensive resources having to be spent to deal with many alternative submissions as to when the contract was formed. Clarity on the precise point of formation being pleaded would have had reduced all these unnecessary costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Nevertheless, it was too late for the defendants to apply to strike out the pleadings when the trial had already concluded (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2017</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (Lexis Nexis, 2017) at para 18/19/8). The issue was merely whether the court should still consider the plaintiff’s submissions and decide on those issues, despite the defective pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Whether the court should adjudicate issues based on defective pleadings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is trite that the function of pleadings is to give fair notice of the case which has to be met and to define the issues which the court will have to decide on so as to resolve the matters in dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 557 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>”) at [61]). They delineate the parameters of the case and shape the course of the trial (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v </span><span class="font-italic">Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span>”) at [36]). Claims not pleaded will generally not be considered by the court (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, the court is not required to adopt an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach, and departure from the general rule is allowed where no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span> at [39]- to [40]). Evidence given at trial, where appropriate, can overcome defect in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced (<span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I considered that it was appropriate to rule on the substantive issues although the pleadings were less than satisfactory. First, this was not a case where the submissions were out of the scope of the pleadings, but it was merely that the pleadings were vague. Although the argument evolved from formation over the course of a year to formation at various points in time, those alleged points in time all fell within the period of October 2011 to October 2012. They were not strictly speaking inconsistent with the pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This approach was also taken in <span class="font-italic">PNG </span>([46] above). There, the pleadings set out a 20 day period as the duration of formation, which the court found was not reasonably certain. However, the evidence, submissions and pleadings seen together presented three possibilities as to the date of formation (at [149]). The court held that the pleadings were less than satisfactory but nevertheless went on to rule on the substantive issues, finding that neither of those three possibilities proved formation (at [149] to [178]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>, which the plaintiff relied on ([52] above),<span class="font-italic"> </span>was not on point with respect to the present case, but the principles provided some guidance. <span class="font-italic">Nagase </span>stands for the proposition that a positive defence must be pleaded via a pregnant denial, but a positive defence may still be raised in relation to a bare denial if the contents to the positive defence in the defendant’s affidavit were not objected to by the plaintiff (at [167] to [177]). In such a scenario, the positive defence can be seen to be a mere development of the pleaded denial (at [175]). In the present case, it was similarly possible for the plaintiff’s evolved case to be seen as a development of the pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, I found that there was no irreparable prejudice to the defendants, and they were not taken by surprise, as to the arguments about the date of formation. Since the plaintiff originally pleaded that the 2012 Agreement was formed over October 2011 to October 2012, it would have in any event been necessary for the defendants to prove that no agreement was formed throughout the entirety of this time. Evolution of the plaintiff’s case such that the date of formation was a specific time within this period, thus did not materially change the defendants’ litigation strategy or burden at trial or in submissions. Indeed, the defendants were able to sufficiently raise evidence at trial and make arguments to deal with each of the plaintiff’s alleged points of formation. I was also able to deal with all the issues in relation to each of the alleged point of formation claimed. Further, the defendants did not object to the plaintiff’s evidence at trial and in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”).

I accepted that that the defendant’s version was to be preferred, because the tenor and content of the emails adduced in evidence (see below) pointed against the allegations made by the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the circumstances made it unlikely for a binding legal agreement to be made. The plaintiff’s testimony was that the calls were made over speakerphone as he was driving.

</div> The decision to transfer shares was an important one that was unlikely to have been made in such a casual and spontaneous manner. There were also 11 other rather important terms which were supposed to have had been made as part of the 2012 Agreement. In that context, the calls seemed more like a casual discussion, rather than a serious one with an intent to enter a binding agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Third, and most importantly, the contemporaneous documents pointed against any agreement. If there had indeed been an agreement reached during the May 2012 Calls, the plaintiff would likely have referenced it in his emails. However, the plaintiff did not make any reference to the call in his contemporaneous emails to Yeo, Tainton or Reid.

It also casts doubt on the evidence adduced to show that a binding agreement was reached at other times.

This greatly weakened the plaintiff’s coherence and consistency, and hence his credibility.

The plaintiff had also been persistently asking about equity ever since the Docklands Meeting and the May 2012 Calls. It was clearly something he wanted to discuss.

</div> It did not assist the defendants to try to deny that the subject was discussed, or characterise the meeting as purely social. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I also did not give much weight to the defendants’ argument that it was inconceivable for Reid’s beneficial ownership was to be substantially reduced in the alleged agreement. It was not wholly inconceivable, given the plaintiff’s efforts and investments in the business, and was a possible way to reach a fair capitalisation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Nevertheless, the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof of showing that an agreement was concluded. The email the plaintiff sent to Tainton and Reid shortly after the Melbourne Meeting did not show that an agreement was concluded at the Melbourne Meeting. Instead, it seems to be more of a proposal, as it states: “Guys… I think we should run with this as a start… and work out the rest later. If you want to change the percentage then please do…”

</div> The email was clearly setting out the plaintiff’s opinion as to what he thought should be done as a start. Further, any proposal in the email was not confirmed, as the plaintiff explicitly stated in the email that Tainton and Reid could change the percentage if they wanted to. If the agreement had been confirmed at the Melbourne Meeting, the plaintiff would likely have had explicitly stated that in writing in the email. The fact that nothing was said about any agreement reached is a glaring omission. The email hence instead goes against the plaintiff, instead of assisting his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The plaintiff’s reliance on Yeo’s email and testimony was also not convincing. Yeo’s email on 25 June 2012 did not show that there was an agreement, but merely stated that he would “work out a schedule based on a [USD]500,000 capitalisation plan”.

</div> As described by Yeo, the negotiations were only a “plan”, and not shown to be a binding agreement. The plaintiff also tried to cherry-pick parts of Yeo’s evidence at trial to argue that Yeo agreed that there was an agreement formed at the Melbourne Meeting. This was disingenuous, as Yeo had unequivocally stated at trial that he did not agree that there was any agreement at the Melbourne Meeting.

Given the above finding that the plaintiff had failed to prove a precise point of formation, and that such a precise point was necessary, there is no need to discuss this, but I shall do so for completeness.

I found the plaintiff to have genuinely believed in his case and brought his case in good faith. Nevertheless, such subjective belief was not sufficient to meet the objective test of agreement required. While there was some force to the plaintiff’s argument that there was no protest or confrontation by Tainton and Reid, there is a well-established general rule that silence alone cannot be the foundation of an agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Felthouse v Bindley</span> (1862) 142 ER 1037 endorsed in <span class="font-italic">CAA Technologies Pte Ltd v Newcon Builders Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 246 at [80]). This is because silence is ordinarily equivocal and cannot be construed as an acceptance. In the present context, the lack of response was similarly equivocal, possibly being due to the fact that the emails were merely proposals and negotiations, such that Tainton and Reid felt no need to respond. It could have also been because they were exasperated at the plaintiff’s persistence that they let him say whatever he wanted.

Biggs testified that it was the plaintiff who had represented to him that he owned 30% beneficial shares. He did not mention that he gained such an opinion from anyone else other than the plaintiff. Biggs believed the plaintiff, which was why he accepted that the plaintiff did own the shares. Hence, Biggs’s opinion was formed in a large part due to the plaintiff’s influence and merely reflects what the plaintiff subjectively thought, without objectively showing that Tainton and Reid had agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Although the plaintiff had made the representation in front of Tainton, Reid, and the others who were present at the meeting, Biggs testified that the plaintiff was only talking to himself and Minczanowaski at that material time.

The plaintiff’s case seems to be that they merely kept silent. Such silence did not prove that there was an agreement. It has been established above that silence is ordinarily not an agreement (above at [116]), and the same is true in this case, where the plaintiff’s representation could have been interpreted by Tainton and Reid as merely a representation of the future position, or of negotiations. There could have been many reasons why they kept silent and the plaintiff did not prove that the silence meant that there was an agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(H) The convertible loan agreement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The plaintiff referred to a convertible loan agreement (“CLA”) where Biggs loaned moneys to Rock Singapore in exchange for an option to convert the moneys to shares.

Even assuming Biggs’s opinion was reflective of the truth, it does not prove that the agreement had been formed by 2012. In any case, although Biggs’s testimony is probative, it is only circumstantial evidence which does not sufficiently prove that agreement had been reached. His opinion that the plaintiff had beneficial ownership was in a large part influenced by the plaintiff. Although Tainton and Reid did not give him any contrary impression, this does not mean that Tainton and Reid had agreed to the terms alleged by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(I) The cumulative effect of the evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In certain cases, it may be that individual strands of evidence would not be sufficient to establish a case and a holistic view needs to be taken of the facts. However, in the present case, even taking all these strands of evidence as a whole did not assist the plaintiff.  The strength of each was too weak to gain weight when taken together, and there was no mutual reinforcement between them. The facts were equivocal and was not sufficient to discharge the plaintiff’s burden of proof. Many factors relied on could be explained in other ways that were just as plausible, and did not definitively point one way or another. More conclusive evidence than such will be needed to prove formation of a contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Certainty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The defendants also argued that the terms of the alleged 2012 Agreement were not certain.

</div> I did not find this to be sufficiently convincing. This was merely the plaintiff’s subjective view of what the nodding meant. Even accepting the plaintiff’s accounts as true, mere nodding and leaving the room on good terms are insufficient to prove agreement (see [116] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Further, many of the points raised by the plaintiff did not directly address the issue of agreement but were either irrelevant or tangential. For example, whether or not a person was angry and/or left the room may in certain situations be important indications if a version of events is the truth. However, in the present case, even if there were inconsistencies as to whether Tainton and Reid had been angry, and even taking the plaintiff’s position that they had not been angry, lack of anger is insufficient to prove acceptance of an agreement.  In any event, some inconsistency is understandable as recollection many years after the event may be hazy, inaccurate or incomplete. Further, the crucial issue at hand was not whether Tainton and Reid had been angry, but whether there had been agreement, and it may have been that the witnesses did not mention about the anger because they had chosen to focus on the latter issue in their AEICs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The inconsistency regarding the plaintiff’s compensation was also not directly relevant or probative. Since Tainton and Reid admitted that they had agreed to pay the plaintiff US$8,000 a month from April 2014, this coincided with the plaintiff’s claim that there was an agreement to pay him that sum, and there was no dispute in that regard.

</div> However, the fact that Yeo and Biggs did not testify about the compensation agreement could be because it did not directly pertain to them and they may have missed out or not focused properly during that part of the discussion. They could have also forgotten it due to the passage of time. In any case, this inconsistency about the compensation did not prove that there was an agreement on the rest of the terms pertaining to share ownership and capitalisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In regards to compensation, I also noted that the plaintiff argued that the US$8,000 payment was agreed to be backdated and beginning from April 2011 ([143] above).

</div> and was not sufficiently proven. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The other arguments raised by the plaintiff relating to the Seattle Meeting were also irrelevant as to whether there was agreement. These included Biggs’s understanding of the capitalisation until that point; the fact that Tainton only first knew about Biggs’s investment/loan at the meeting; and the plausibility of Tainton and Reid willing to reduce their shares to 12.5%. Even accepting the plaintiff’s account of these points, they did not prove agreement.

The plaintiff pointed to a document between Yeo and Biggs, but was unable to confirm that it was a requisite resolution.

</div> The only occasion when Biggs mentioned that the plaintiff might not be a shareholder was when the plaintiff wanted to have an external party, Berner, join as a shareholder. However, Biggs mentioning that the plaintiff might not be a shareholder on that occasion was merely because Berner was an external party; such language was to avoid trouble in the future, and was pending the tying up of loose ends via a shareholders agreement.

Similar to Yeo, Biggs may have had used loose language in the communications (above at [112]). For example, Biggs’s statement that the April 2011 Agreements had been “overtaken by circumstances” did not mean that it had been replaced with a new agreement, but merely that the circumstances had changed from then.

</div> There is much to be said for the proposition that a commercial setting would generally make it less likely for proprietary estoppel to be successfully claimed; parties dealing at arm’s length in such a setting would expect to have their dealings resolved through contractual arrangements more than anything else. Representations made in such a setting would be less likely to be relied upon, and representations would be less likely to be treated as operative representations that are effective in proprietary estoppel.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Hence, the proper space for proprietary estoppel should not normally include commercial situations, where parties would be expected to arrange their affairs through the prism of contract law. The risk of allowing proprietary estoppel full reign in a commercial setting is that it could engender uncertainty. Proprietary estoppel claims are intensely fact sensitive, and there are no bright line rules; it would require careful consideration of the facts, and careful sifting of the various allegations that are made to determine what the facts are (<span class="font-italic">Andy Low </span>(above at [189]) at [17]). The whole process is inimical to the sort of fast and robust determination that is required to ensure that commercial transactions are not hindered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Finally, it was also noted in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 9(4) (Butterworths Asia, 2018 Reissue)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 110.981 that in commercial cases, it seems insufficient for the representee to claim that what was expected would be a negotiated agreement which would contain the outstanding terms which had not been agreed. I agreed with this, as it would be a backdoor way of making claims where the negotiations produced no agreement. In other words, in the commercial context, negotiations falling short of agreement would likely not sufficiently constitute a representation making out proprietary estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 For these reasons, I was not inclined to allow proprietary estoppel in the present case since there was an underlying contractual foundation in the form of the April 2011 Agreements, and since there were contractual negotiations in progress which had not crystallised into any agreement. In any case, there was no sufficient representation to make out any proprietary estoppel. Further, as will be shown below, there was no clear and unequivocal representation, and also no detrimental reliance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel by representation and convention</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Estoppel by representation requires a clear and unambiguous representation of fact; reliance; and detriment (<span class="font-italic">Linkforce Pte Ltd v Kajima Overseas Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 46 at [18]). It requires representation of an existing fact, and must be distinguished from promissory estoppel, which applies to representations of the promisor’s intention as regards its future conduct (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Phang</span>”) at para 04.100).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 On the other hand, estoppel by convention is not founded on any representation but on an agreed statement of facts, the truth of which has been assumed by the parties to be the basis of the transaction (<span class="font-italic">MAE Engineering Ltd v Fire-Stop </span><span class="font-italic">Marketing Services Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 379 (“<span class="font-italic">MAE Engineering</span>”) at [44]). In other words, there must be a shared assumption as regards a particular interpretation of the parties’ contractual rights or liabilities (<span class="font-italic">Phang </span>at para 04.102). The requirements are that: there must be a course of dealing between two parties in a contractual relationship; the course of dealing must be such that both parties must have had proceeded on the basis of an agreed interpretation of the contract; and it must be unjust to allow one party to go back on the agreed interpretation (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Island Country Club v Hillborne</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 418 at [27]; <span class="font-italic">MAE Engineering</span> at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Both estoppel by representation and estoppel by convention are evidential doctrines that can aid in the construction of agreements (<span class="font-italic">Phang</span> at para 04.102).

</div> This seemed to be wrongly using the doctrines as swords to claim contractual remedies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 As stated, estoppel by convention operates only where parties are in a contractual relationship. The function of the doctrine is to hold parties to a certain agreed interpretation of the contract. It cannot be used in this case to prove that there was a share ownership and capitalisation contract when there was none. It was also not argued that the share ownership and capitalisation terms were an agreed interpretation of the April 2011 Agreements.

Some of the alleged representations raised by the plaintiff did not pertain to representations of facts, but should be properly characterised as promises. For example, it was alleged that Tainton and Reid represented that they both “agreed to reduce” their respective ownership, and that the plaintiff “would be” a 30% shareholder.

</div> These alleged representations deal with future intention and are not representations of existing fact, and thus fail to qualify as requisite representations under estoppel by representation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Only the remaining alleged representations dealing with existing fact need to be considered, to show if these facts can be used to prove formation of a contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I found that there were no unequivocal representations or understanding that would have supported any form of estoppel. While a representation differs from acceptance of an offer, there has to similarly be an element of certainty and definitiveness about a statement before it can amount to a representation. A tentative proposal, or a statement leaving open the possibility of something, would not generally be sufficient to amount to a representation of fact or an agreed assumption that would support an estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In the sections above (from [34] to [183]), I had gone through in great detail the various alleged facts that the plaintiff relied on to prove acceptance, and explained why they were equivocal and not sufficiently probative. These alleged facts were largely the same ones that the plaintiff argued were representations. The above reasons apply similarly here and I will not repeat the full analysis here, but merely sum up the key points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The various correspondences and statements made were not finalised, but were proposals and negotiations working towards a future agreement. The matters between the parties also remained fluctuating with the proposed shareholding changing constantly. The plaintiff’s own emails showed that he understood that there had been no finalised agreement or final representation, but that things were still being firmed up (see above at [91] and [161]). Similar to above, I observed that the language of some of the parties were slightly loose, but looking at them in context, none of them amounted to a clear and unequivocal representation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Representations in relation to the 2012 Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Email representations</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The emails that the plaintiff relied upon as representations fell short of what was required and were at most tentative statements only. As dealt with above at [168] to [170], what was said or communicated by Tainton and Reid did not have the nature of unequivocal, definite statements that should have led to any reliance or detriment by the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In relation to Yeo’s emails, it should be emphasised that Yeo’s perspective was coloured by what the plaintiff had conveyed to him and any supposed representation from him would have had to be taken with that in mind (see also above at [109], [112] and [167]). The plaintiff could not point to matters stated by Yeo as affirming a particular position, since he was the ultimate source of all of Yeo’s information about the company and the dealings with Tainton and Reid at least up to this point.

However, for completeness, I note that it is doubtful whether there was detrimental reliance. There has to be a causal link between each specific detriment and the specific corresponding representation, but it was not explained which specific detriment was caused by which specific representation, and how it was caused. Even ignoring the link between the specific detriment and specific representation, and taking the plaintiff’s argument at its highest that the detriments as a whole were caused by the representations as a whole, it was not proven that the detriments were caused by relying on the alleged representations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The plaintiff’s alleged detriments could have been explained by other reasons.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 I accepted the defendants’ contention that the date of assessing damages should be the date of the breach, but for slightly different reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 The key question in determining the date of assessing damages is to determine when the plaintiff ought reasonably to have mitigated the breach: <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Agnew</span> [1980] AC 367 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”) at 400 (see also <span class="font-italic">Phang </span>at para 22.004):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Damages were held measureable as at the date of hearing rather than at the date of the defendant’s breach, unless the plaintiff ought reasonably to have mitigated the breach at an earlier date …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 This was also noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tay Joo Sing v Ku Yu Sang</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 765 at [37], stating: “The key question in this appeal is whether the respondent ought to have mitigated his loss in the circumstances”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 The general rule is that the plaintiff is expected to mitigate his loss from the date of the breach, and hence damages are assessed at the time of breach (<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at 400; <span class="font-italic">Phang </span>at para 22.004). However, where the innocent party reasonably tries to have the contract completed, or tries to seek specific performance where specific performance is a possible remedy, the damages should be assessed at the date where specific performance is no longer available. <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at 400 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In cases where a breach of a contract for sale has occurred, and the innocent party reasonably continues to try to have the contract completed, it would to me appear more logical and just rather than to tie him to the date of the original breach, to assess damages as at the date when (otherwise than by his default) the contract is lost …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 This was similarly noted in <span class="font-italic">Lim Beng Cheng v Lim Ngee Sing</span> [2015] SGHC 282 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Beng Cheng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [122]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It would be fair to say that an innocent buyer in a contract for the sale of land, being generally entitled to specific performance, is not expected to mitigate his loss if he is pursuing specific performance. Put another way, the reasoning that damages should be assessed as at the date of breach because the innocent purchaser can purchase a replacement from the market on the date of the breach does not hold true for contracts for the sale of unique goods where specific performance is a possible (and, in fact, desired) remedy. Thus, where damages are awarded in lieu of specific performance, the principle that damages should be assessed as at the date of the breach do not normally apply; a buyer’s entitlement to such damages should be assessed from the date that specific performance is no longer available.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 The rationale for this rule was explained in <span class="font-italic">Ho Kian Siang v Ong Cheng Hoo</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 480 at [30] (see also <span class="font-italic">Phang </span>at 22.004), where the court stated that assessing damages in lieu of specific performance at the time of the breach would effectively render the right to seek specific performance worthless: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 Mr Sreenivasan’s first submission is that damages should be assessed as of the date of breach which in the present case is the contractual date of completion… But it seems to me that apart from authority, if this be the law, then the right given to the innocent party to seek specific performance would be worthless. If the innocent party were required to mitigate his damages from the time of breach he would in effect be confined to seeking his remedy in damages. I shall illustrate this with the following example. X enters into a contract to purchase a property from Y. On the date of contract, X had taken the view that the property will rise in value. Y fails to complete on the contractual completion date. X decides to sue for specific performance. In a situation where damages, if awarded in lieu of specific performance, are assessed at the time of breach then X, having taken the view that the market is on the rise, would have to go into the market and purchase an equivalent property. But should X succeed in obtaining an order for specific performance and Y then completes the transaction, X would be saddled with 2 properties. This is all very well if the market has moved up. But if it moved down instead, it would have doubled his losses in a situation where he had bargained for only half the exposure. The other reason why the right would be futile is a practical one. X would have paid to Y a deposit of about 10% of the purchase price. If X seeks an order for specific performance, he is not entitled to ask for the refund of this deposit. Without that money he is not likely to be able to purchase another property to mitigate his damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 Applying these principles, the question in the present case is whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have sought specific performance (although he ultimately elected for damages in lieu of specific performance).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>(above at [53]) established that specific performance is a special and extraordinary remedy that should only be granted discretionarily where it is just and equitable to do so (at [52] to [53]). The court will consider whether damages is an adequate remedy, and whether the person against whom specific performance is sought would suffer substantial hardship (at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 However, the court observed that while a contract to transfer shares in a publicly listed company will generally not be specifically enforced, a contract to transfer shares in an unlisted company is entitled to be specifically enforced, relying on several cases (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… While a contract to transfer shares in a <span class="font-italic">publicly</span> listed company will generally not be specifically enforced, a contract to transfer shares in an unlisted company on the other hand can be specifically enforced at the suit of either purchaser or vendor (see <span class="font-italic">Jones &amp; Goodhart</span> at pp 161–162). In <span class="font-italic">Pamaron Holdings Sdn Bhd v Ganda Holdings Bhd</span> [1988] 3 MLJ 346, it was unequivocally held (at [16]), that ‘a seller of shares not freely saleable in the open market is entitled to specific performance’. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Duncuft v Albrecht</span> (1841) 12 Sim 189, the court decreed specific performance for the sale of shares which were limited in number and not always available in the open market. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 This approach makes sense as shares in an unlisted company are unique, and the loss of these shares cannot be easily mitigated since such shares cannot be bought off the market and are not readily substitutable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span> also noted that the fact that the plaintiff’s interest in the contract is purely monetary should not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>preclude the grant of specific performance (at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 In the present case, (assuming there was breach of contract) it had been legally possible for the plaintiff to pursue a claim for specific performance to obtain beneficial ownership of 30% of the shares in Rock Singapore. Rock Singapore was a private limited company and the shares were only owned by Tainton and Reid. They were unique, and not purchasable on the open market. There was a reasonable chance for the claim in specific performance to have had succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 However, even though it had been legally possible, it was practically useless for the plaintiff to obtain 30% shares in Rock Singapore as almost all the assets in Rock Singapore had been transferred to Rock Nutrients International.

</div> Hence, 30% ownership of Rock Singapore had no practical value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 The more important question was whether the plaintiff could gain specific performance of the term in the 2012 Agreement requiring that sale of the Rock Products would not be carried out other than through Rock Singapore (see [16] above). This would require the defendants to transfer the assets from Rock Nutrients International back to Rock Singapore and conduct business there again, which would give value to the plaintiff’s 30% beneficial ownership in Rock Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 Applying the principles of specific performance, it is clear that this was highly unlikely to have succeeded. This was not an extraordinary situation where the discretion to grant specific performance had to be exercised to achieve justice. Further, it would cause hardship to the defendants, who had clearly fallen out with the plaintiff for business reasons, and who wanted to carry on their own business with nothing to do with the plaintiff. Tainton and Reid were furious that the plaintiff purported to represent the Rock Business at an event known as the High Times Cannabis Cup, which was a decision they did not agree with.

Based on the pleadings, the plaintiff’s proper remedy should only have had been damages in lieu of 30% of shares of Rock Singapore, if he had succeeded (see above at [22] to [27]). However, the valuation did not only specifically pertain to Rock Singapore, but was a valuation of the entire Rock Business, covering all sales of Rock Products outside of Australia.

</div> Cannabis and cannabis mixture are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), and trafficking, importing or exporting more than a certain specified amount of them attracts the mandatory death penalty under the Second Schedule of the MDA. The MDA has extraterritorial application and also criminalises the aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring of the commission of any offence under the MDA within Singapore, even if all of the acts were done outside Singapore, and also criminalises acts done outside Singapore which if committed in Singapore would be an offence under the MDA (see s 13 MDA). This raised a question of whether the purported contract was tainted by illegality such that the claim should not be allowed to proceed, or whether the claim was contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 The plaintiff argued that no issue of illegality arises, and took note that it was also not raised by the defendants.
